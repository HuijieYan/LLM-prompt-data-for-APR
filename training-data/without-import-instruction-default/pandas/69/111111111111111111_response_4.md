The potential error in the buggy function is most likely within the `_convert_key` function. It seems that the function is not handling the different types of index (i.e., float vs. integer) and key values properly, leading to a ValueError being raised in certain cases.

The bug's cause: 
The `_convert_key` function is not correctly handling the cases where the index is of type float and the key is of type integer (or vice versa).

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_convert_key` function to handle cases where the index and key are of different types (float, integer) by properly checking and casting the key to match the type of the index.
2. Use the `is_integer` method to check the type of the index and key, and then cast the key to match the index type if needed.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        # Get the index type
        index_type = type(self.obj.index)
        
        # Convert the key to match the index type
        if index_type == pd.Float64Index:
            return pd.Float64Index(key)
        elif index_type == pd.Int64Index:
            return pd.Int64Index(key)
        elif index_type == pd.DatetimeIndex:
            return pd.DatetimeIndex(key)
        elif index_type == pd.TimedeltaIndex:
            return pd.TimedeltaIndex(key)

```

The corrected code should now handle cases where the index and key are of different types and properly cast the key to match the index type.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
