Potential error location: 
The potential error in the function lies in the 'is_integer' and 'holds_integer' methods being called on the 'ax' object, as they are not defined within the given function.

Bug's cause:
The 'is_integer' and 'holds_integer' methods are not defined within the function, causing a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the 'ax' object has defined 'is_integer' and 'holds_integer' methods.
2. Use alternative methods or logic to achieve the required functionality without relying on the undefined methods.

Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if hasattr(ax, 'is_integer') and hasattr(ax, 'holds_integer'):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        else:
            # handle case when is_integer and holds_integer are not defined
            raise AttributeError(
                "is_integer and/or holds_integer methods are not defined for the object axes"
            )
    return key
