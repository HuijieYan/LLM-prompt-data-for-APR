1. Analysis:
The buggy function is _convert_key, which is a method of the class _AtIndexer. The failing test is testing the behavior of at based indexing with non-integer indexes and indexers. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError raised when using at based indexing on a non-integer index with an integer indexer.

2. Potential Error Location:
The potential error is likely within the for loop of the _convert_key method, where it iterates through the axes and keys and raises a ValueError if certain conditions are met.

3. Bug's Cause:
(a) The buggy function _convert_key checks if the index is integer or non-integer and raises a ValueError if the indexer doesn't match the index type.
(b) The class _AtIndexer is used to perform at based indexing.
(c) The failing test checks the behavior of at based indexing with non-integer indexes and indexers and raises a ValueError when using at based indexing on a non-integer index with an integer indexer.
(d) The GitHub Issue identifies that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the _convert_key method to handle the case of non-integer index with an integer indexer, allowing for at based indexing with mixed types.

5. Corrected Code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i) and not pd.isna(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not (is_integer(i) or pd.isna(i)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the case of non-integer index with an integer indexer, allowing at based indexing with mixed types. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
