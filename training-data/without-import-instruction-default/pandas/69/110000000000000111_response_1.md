1. The buggy function is a method that is likely a part of a class used for data manipulation or analysis. It is meant to convert a key for indexing purposes. The GitHub issue title indicates that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, which suggests that there may be issues with the way the function handles indexing or value retrieval for specific data types or scenarios, such as Float64Index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional statements that check for integer values and the type of index. If these checks are not correctly identifying the type of index and the indexer, it could lead to errors when attempting to perform the indexing.

3. The buggy function appears to be checking the type and properties of the index and the keys used for indexing. The GitHub issue suggests that there are issues with Series lookups for Float64Index. This implies that there may be inaccuracies in how the function is handling indexing for floating point indexes, leading to incorrect or unexpected results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include revisiting the conditional checks for index type and indexer type, ensuring that they accurately identify the types and handle them appropriately. Additionally, considering specific scenarios related to Float64Index and addressing potential issues specific to this data type may also be necessary.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with handling integer and non-integer indexers, and ensures that the function accurately checks for the type and properties of the index and the keys used for indexing. This should help resolve the issues related to Series lookups for Float64Index and potentially other corner cases in indexing.
