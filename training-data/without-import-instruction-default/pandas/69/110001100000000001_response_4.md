Potential error location: The error may occur in the if statement checking for the type of the index, as well as the comparison to see if the index is an integer.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function is not handling the type of the index correctly. It is trying to check if the index is an integer, but the comparison is to a hypothetical `is_integer` function that does not exist. It should be using the `is_integer()` method of the index instead.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index is an instance of an integer type, rather than comparing it to a non-existent function.
2. Use the `is_integer()` method provided by the index to check if it holds integer values.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)) and not isinstance(ax, (pd.Int64Index, pd.Float64Index)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In this corrected code, we are checking if the index is an instance of either `pd.Int64Index` or `pd.Float64Index`, and if so, we are ensuring that the key is also an instance of `int` or `float`. If the index is not of type integer or float, we are checking if the key is also not of type int or float. This should handle the type checking correctly and fix the bug.
