1. Analysis:
   (a). The problematic function is _convert_key which is part of the _AtIndexer class.
   (b). The failing test is trying to access the value at a specific index using the at method, which internally calls the _convert_key function.
   (c). The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexes properly.
   (d). The GitHub issue highlights that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

2. Potential error location:
   The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling non-integer indexes.

3. Bug Cause:
   (a). The buggy function is not properly handling non-integer indexes, leading to a ValueError being raised.
   (b). The buggy class contains the buggy function and is related to the at method used in the failing test.
   (c). The failing test triggers the at method, which calls the _convert_key function, and results in a ValueError due to non-integer index handling.
   (d). The GitHub issue points out that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Update the _convert_key function to properly handle non-integer indexes.
   (b). Refactor the logic in the _convert_key function to ensure it can handle various index types without raising an error.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code includes updated logic for handling non-integer indexes in the _convert_key function. This updated logic ensures that the function can handle different index types properly, resolving the issue highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
