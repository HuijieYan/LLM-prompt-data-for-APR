1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The function is responsible for converting the key based on certain conditions.

2. The potential error in the function is likely related to the logic for checking the type of the index and the key, and then raising a ValueError based on certain conditions.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function has conditional checks for the type of index and key, but the logic for these checks seems to be incorrect or incomplete.
   (b). The class to which the function belongs also contains other related functions that are responsible for indexing and accessing data, which might be impacted by the buggy function.
   (c). The related functions might rely on the correct behavior of `_convert_key` to perform indexing operations, so any issues with this function could lead to errors in these related functions as well.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - The type checking logic in the function needs to be reviewed and corrected based on the requirements for key conversion and index type.
   - Ensure that the function can handle different types of indices and keys appropriately, and raise exceptions only when necessary based on the index type and key type.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
            key = [key]
    else:
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
    return key
```
