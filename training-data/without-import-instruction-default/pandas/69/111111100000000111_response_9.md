1. The buggy function _convert_key() is part of the _AtIndexer class in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. This function is responsible for converting the keys based on certain conditions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the for loop where it iterates through the axes of the object and the key. There might be issues with the logic for checking if the index is an integer and if the key is an integer.

3. The bug's cause could be related to the improper handling of integer and non-integer indices and keys. This can lead to incorrect indexing and retrieval of values, especially for Float64Index cases as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The issue seems to be related to series lookups being affected for Float64Index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for checking if the index is an integer and if the key is an integer. Make sure it aligns with the correct data types and conditions for the specific index type.
   - Review the handling of non-integer indices and keys, especially for Float64Index cases, to ensure proper indexing and retrieval of values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function _convert_key():

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

This corrected code includes proper type-checking for the index and keys, with distinct conditions for integer and non-integer indexes. It should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report related to series lookups being affected for Float64Index cases.
