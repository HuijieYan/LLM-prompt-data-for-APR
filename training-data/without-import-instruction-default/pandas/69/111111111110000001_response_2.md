The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` function within the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The failing test is trying to access the value at key `4` using the `at` method, and it is raising a `ValueError` because the key is being treated as a non-integer index.

The cause of the bug is in the `_convert_key` function where it is not handling non-integer keys correctly.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to handle non-integer keys properly. It should check the type of the index and ensure that the keys are of the same type. If a non-integer key is provided for a non-integer index, it should not raise an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The source code of the buggy function
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)"""

        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, (pd.Float64Index, pd.Index)) and not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

With this modification, the `_convert_key` function now checks if the index is a `Float64Index` or a `Numeric Index` and ensures that the keys are of the same type. It should now pass the failing test.
