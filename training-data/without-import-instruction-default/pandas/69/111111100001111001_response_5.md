The bug in the _convert_key function is that it does not handle the case when the index is a non-integer index. The function incorrectly compares the index type with the type of the key, leading to incorrect type checking for integer and non-integer indexes.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to correctly compare the index type with the key type, handling both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the _convert_key function should now handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly, satisfying all the expected input/output variable information provided.
