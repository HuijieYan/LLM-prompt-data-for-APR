1. The buggy function is _convert_key within the class _AtIndexer, and it seems to be related to Series lookups affected for the Float64Index case, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function is responsible for converting the key and handling different types of indexes, but it seems to have some issues with handling integer and non-integer indexes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that checks for the type of index and the type of the key.

3. (a). The buggy function checks the type of the index and the key to ensure they are compatible.
   (b). The buggy class _AtIndexer seems to be an indexing class that is used in Series lookups, and the issue seems to be affecting the Float64Index case.
   (c). The GitHub Issue information suggests that the bug is causing problems with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Reviewing the logic for checking the type of index and key to ensure it is correctly handling integer and non-integer indexes.
   b. Adding more specific error messages to indicate the exact nature of the problem when incompatible index types are encountered.
   c. Testing the function with different types of indexes and keys to identify any edge cases that may not be handled correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
            elif not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-Float64Index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by properly handling the type of index and key and raising specific value errors when incompatible types are encountered. Additionally, it ensures compatibility with the Float64Index case as described in the GitHub issue.
