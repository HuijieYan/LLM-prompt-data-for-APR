1. The problematic function is `_convert_key` and it is part of the `_AtIndexer` class. The failing test is trying to use this function to convert the key for indexing, and it is raising a ValueError with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is in the for loop where it checks if the index is an integer or not and then compares it with the key. There seems to be a mismatch in the comparison logic.

3. The bug's cause seems to be related to how the function checks the type of the index and key, and raises a ValueError based on that comparison. The failing test tries to use the `at` accessor with an integer index, which should be supported but it's currently failing due to the ValueError being raised incorrectly.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the logic of the `_convert_key` function to correctly compare the type of the index and the key, and only raise a ValueError if they are incompatible.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i) and not isinstance(i, ax.dtype.type):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer or index type matching indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or isinstance(i, ax.dtype.type):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer or index type matching indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected version, the function now checks if the key matches the index type, including both integer and non-integer types. It raises a ValueError only if the key type mismatches the index type. This should allow the failing test to pass without raising a ValueError.
