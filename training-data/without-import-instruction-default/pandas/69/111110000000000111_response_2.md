1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer`, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The GitHub issue mentions the bug affecting `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` which are related to series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the validation of index types and the handling of integer and non-integer indexes.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the validation checks for index types not being handled correctly. This can lead to incorrect indexing and retrieval of values from the Float64Index series.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Proper validation of index types and handling of integer and non-integer indexes
   - Ensuring that the function returns the correct key type based on the index type
   - Handling edge cases for the Float64Index series specifically

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):  # corrected validation for integer index
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):  # corrected validation for non-integer index
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code ensures proper validation of index types and handles integer and non-integer indexes appropriately based on the index type. This should resolve the issue affecting `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.
