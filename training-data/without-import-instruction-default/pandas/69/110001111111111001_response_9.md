The buggy function `_convert_key` checks if the keys are of the same type as the index and raises a ValueError if not. The problem seems to be with the check for integer values when the index is of type float.

1. The failing test tries to retrieve values from the series using indexing and asserts that the values are instances of the expected type and are equal to the expected value. The error message indicates that the ValueError is raised during the call to `ser.at[4]`.

2. The bug is caused by the function incorrectly checking for integer values when the index is of type float.

3. The `_convert_key` function should not raise a ValueError if the index is of type float. It should only raise a ValueError if non-integer values are used for integer indexes. Since float can accommodate both integer and non-integer values, the logic in the function needs to be adjusted. 

4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to:
   - Allow floats as index values without triggering a ValueError
   - Only raise a ValueError if non-integer values are used with an integer index

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this modification, the `_convert_key` function should now correctly handle both integer and non-integer index values.

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
