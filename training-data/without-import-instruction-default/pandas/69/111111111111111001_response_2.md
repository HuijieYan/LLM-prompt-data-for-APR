The issue is with the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class inside the `pandas/core/indexing.py` module. The function is intended to require the keys to be of the same type as the index, but it is raising a `ValueError` in the else block when it should not.

The reason for this error is that the function is trying to compare the integer nature of the index and the key, resulting in a failure since the integer nature of the index and the key are not aligning correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer indexers correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # Check if the index consists of integers
        if isinstance(ax, Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # Index does not consist of integers
            if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated code now correctly checks for the type of the index and the key, and raises a `ValueError` only when there is a mismatch between them. It should now pass the failing test as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
