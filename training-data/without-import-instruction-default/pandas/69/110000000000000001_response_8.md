1. The buggy function is intended to handle the conversion of keys for an index, with the option to specify if the function is being used as a setter.
2. The potential error is likely within the for loop where it checks the type of the index key.
3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the comparison of index key types to the index type, causing errors in the validation logic.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Ensuring that the key type matches the index type for both integer and non-integer cases.
   b. Adding comprehensive error handling for different scenarios.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index to ensure compatibility.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
