The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the case where the index is of type float64. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a float64 index "
                "can only have float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(ax, (pd.Int64Index, pd.Float64Index)) and pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function checks the type of the index (whether it's a float64 or integer index) and then only allows the corresponding type of indexers.
