The buggy function is `_convert_key` within the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is supposed to ensure that keys match the type of the index when performing at-based indexing. The issue arises when the function incorrectly determines the type of the input key and raises a ValueError based on the incorrect type.

The failing test is related to the `Float64Index.get_value` method, and the error message indicates that the function is mistakenly raising a ValueError for non-integer indexers when it shouldn't.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly identifying the type of the key and raising a ValueError based on this incorrect identification. This leads to failing tests and the GitHub issue being raised.

To fix the bug, the function `_convert_key` needs to accurately determine the type of the index and the key, and then apply the appropriate logic to distinguish between integer and non-integer indexers.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.dtype == 'float64':
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should accurately check the type of the index and key and apply the corresponding logic, passing the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output variable information, and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
