Potential error location: 
The bug may be caused by the condition checking for integer types and the method calls to `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()`.

Bug's cause:
The bug could be caused by the incorrect usage of `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods when checking the types of the index and indexers. It seems that the correct methods for these checks are not being called, leading to potential errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct methods for checking the type of the index and indexers.
2. Ensure that the comparison between the index and indexers is done correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods have been replaced with `isinstance()` checks to correctly verify the index and indexers' types. The types of index and indexers are checked using `pd.Int64Index` and `pd.Float64Index` to ensure the correct comparison. Additionally, the comparison between index and indexers has been corrected to prevent any potential errors.
