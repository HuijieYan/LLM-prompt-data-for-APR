1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to handle key conversion in the `pandas` library while indexing. It checks if the key is a setter, and if not, it iterates through the axes and checks for certain conditions.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely in the iteration process where it compares the type of index and the type of key.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect use of functions such as `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` which are not standard Python functions and are not defined within the scope of the given function.

4. To fix the bug, we can use standard Python functions such as `isinstance()` to check the type of the index and the key. We also need to make sure that the comparison is valid and meaningful for the data types being compared.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key

```

In the corrected code, we use the `isinstance()` function to check the type of the index and the key. We also utilize the `pd.Int64Index` object to check for integer indexes. This ensures that the comparison is valid and meaningful for the data types being compared.
