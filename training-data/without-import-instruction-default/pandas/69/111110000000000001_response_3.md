1. The buggy function _convert_key is a method of the class _AtIndexer. It is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index when performing indexing operations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for checking whether the key is of the same type as the index.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the type checking for the key and the index. It is also not checking for the type of the index before performing the conversion.

4. The bug can be fixed by adding proper type checking and handling for different scenarios when converting the key.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we added type checking using the isinstance function to ensure that the key and the index are of the same type. We also added handling for different scenarios based on the type of the index.
