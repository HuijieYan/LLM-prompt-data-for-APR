The buggy function is intended to check if the keys are the same type as the index in a pandas DataFrame. It does this by iterating through the index and checking if the index is an integer or non-integer type, and then checking if the key is an integer or non-integer type.

The bug is in the line `if ax.is_integer():`, as there is no `is_integer` method for the `Float64Index` class, which is what `ax` is. Instead, we should be using the `is_integer` method on the index value itself.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to use the `is_integer` method on the index values and update the error messages accordingly. 

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated function uses `pd.api.types.is_integer` to check if the key is an integer, and the `is_integer` method on the index value to check if the index is an integer. The error messages are also updated to reflect the correct conditions.
