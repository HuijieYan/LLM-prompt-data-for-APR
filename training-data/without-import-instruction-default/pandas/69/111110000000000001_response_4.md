1. The buggy function _convert_key is part of the _AtIndexer class, which is subclassing _ScalarAccessIndexer and containing the method to fix.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it checks the type of index and raises a ValueError if it does not match.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the type validation for the index and not handling the case where the key and index types do not match. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors in the program.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Implement a more robust type validation for the index and handle the case where the key and index types do not match.
   - Add appropriate error handling and messages to inform the user of the issue.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if the key is an integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():  # Check if the key is not an integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
In the corrected code, we have added type validation checks using the isinstance method to ensure that the key and index types match appropriately. We have also added descriptive error messages to inform the user of the issue.
