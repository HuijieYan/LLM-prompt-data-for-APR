Potential error location:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the loop that iterates over the axes of the object. It checks if the index is integer and then compares if the value of the key is an integer. However, there is a problem with the logic as it is not checking if the value of the key matches the type of the index.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling the type of the index and key values. The function is not comparing the type of the index with the type of the key, leading to incorrect behavior for certain cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the loop to check the type of the index and compare it with the type of the key.
2. Add conditionals to handle different types of indexes and keys appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected code includes additional checks to ensure that the type of the key matches the type of the index. This modification should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
