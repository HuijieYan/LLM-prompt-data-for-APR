The problematic function `_convert_key` is used to convert the key and ensure it matches the same type as the index before performing indexing operations. The bug seems to be occurring when the function is checking for integer or non-integer indexes and key values. This causes the ValueError to be raised, leading to the failing test.

Root cause:
The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` function when checking for integer and non-integer indexes and key values.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes and key values to handle the cases where Float64Index is involved.
2. Update the conversion of the key to match the type of the index.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            # Handle Float64Index specifically
            i = float(i)  # Convert key to float if the index is Float64Index
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected function includes a specific case for handling `Float64Index`. When encountering a `Float64Index`, it converts the key to a float before proceeding with the checks for integer and non-integer indexes and key values. This approach should address the issue and resolve the failing test while satisfying the GitHub issue.
