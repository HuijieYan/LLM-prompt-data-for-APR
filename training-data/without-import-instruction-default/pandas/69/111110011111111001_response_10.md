The bug is caused by the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is not handling different data types in the `key` properly, resulting in a ValueError when non-integer indexes are used with integer keys.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function appropriately handles different data types for `key` and the series index. We will modify the `_convert_key` function to check the type of the index and the type of keys, then apply the appropriate checks for integer and non-integer values.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, so we don't fallback.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = self.obj.index.dtype
    key_type = type(key[0])

    if index_type == 'datetime64[ns]':
        if not np.issubdtype(key_type, np.floating):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have floating indexers"
            )
    elif index_type == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        if not np.issubdtype(key_type, np.integer):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    return key
```

This corrected code handles different data types in the `key` properly for different types of indexes and should pass the failing test cases provided.
