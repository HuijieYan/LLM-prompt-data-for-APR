The buggy function is supposed to require the keys to be the same type as the index, but it is currently checking the type of each key element against the type of the index as a whole, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to directly compare the type of the key to the type of the index, rather than comparing each individual element of the key to the entire index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    key_type = type(key)
    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    if key_type != index_type:
        raise ValueError("Keys must be the same type as the index")

    return key
```

With this corrected function, it ensures that the type of the key matches the type of the index without iterating through individual elements of the key. This should resolve the issues identified in the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
