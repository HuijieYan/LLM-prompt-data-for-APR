1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class, test code, and error message:
   - The function `_convert_key` is being called to convert a key when performing an at-based indexing operation.
   - The failing tests are focusing on at-based indexing with non-integer indexes, which throws a `ValueError`.

2. Identifying the potential error location within the problematic function:
   - The potential error location in the `_convert_key` function seems to be in the `for` loop, where it checks the type of the index.

3. Elucidating the bug's cause:
   - The `_convert_key` function is raising a `ValueError` when trying to perform at-based indexing on a non-integer index with non-integer indexers.

4. Suggesting possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_convert_key` function to handle at-based indexing on non-integer indexes with non-integer indexers properly.
   - The function should be updated to handle different types of indexes and indexers more explicitly.

5. Presenting the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
By updating the `_convert_key` function as shown above, it handles the different types of indexes and indexers correctly and should pass the failing test.
