The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is related to the `IndexingMixin.at` function. The GitHub issue title suggests that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`. Since the `_convert_key` function is related to indexing, it is possible that the bug is causing issues with Series lookups for Float64Index.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is likely in the logic that checks whether the index contains integers and how it handles setting the key.

The bug's cause could be that the function is not properly handling cases where the index contains integers and non-integers, leading to issues with Series lookups for Float64Index.

To fix the bug, the function `_convert_key` needs to be updated to properly handle cases where the index contains both integers and non-integers. This may involve restructuring the logic for checking the index type and how it handles setting the key.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected code of the buggy function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        return key
```

This corrected code should handle cases where the index contains both integers and non-integers, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
