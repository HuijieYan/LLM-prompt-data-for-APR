1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, related functions, and the GitHub issue, it appears that the problematic function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the keys to be the same type as the index. The function is part of the `_AtIndexer` class in the pandas library's `indexing.py` file. The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that there are issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for checking if the index is an integer and handling the conversion of keys based on the index type.

3. Elucidating the bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index.
   (b). The buggy class `_AtIndexer` is used for scalar access indexing.
   (c). The related functions like `at` and `is_integer` are used for indexing and checking if a value is an integer.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information indicates that there are corner cases affecting the `get_value` function for DTI and Float64Index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Review the logic inside the `_convert_key` function to ensure that keys are being converted correctly based on the index type.
- Test corner cases involving DTI and Float64Index to identify specific scenarios where the bug occurs and address them in the code.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a Float64Index "
                        "can only have float indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we have added specific checks for Float64Index and non-integer indexes to ensure that keys are being converted appropriately based on the index type. This correction should address the issues raised in the GitHub bug report.
