The issue is with the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is responsible for converting the key to a suitable format based on the index's data type. 

The error message indicates that the function is raising a `ValueError` when the key is non-integer and the index is non-integer. This behavior does not match the expected test results, and it's likely the cause of the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle non-integer keys and indexes properly. It should not raise a ValueError in this scenario and should instead handle the conversion gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function will handle the conversion of keys based on the index's data type without raising unnecessary ValueErrors. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
