The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to ensure that keys are of the same type as the index. The error is due to the function incorrectly handling non-integer indexes.

Based on the error message from the failing test, the issue lies in the code block:
```python
else:
    if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
        raise ValueError(
            "At based indexing on an non-integer "
            "index can only have non-integer "
            "indexers"
        )
```
The function should not check for `is_integer(i)` for non-integer indexes.

The bug is causing a `ValueError` to be raised when attempting to use non-integer index for `at` based indexing.

To fix the bug, the code inside the `else` block needs to be modified to handle non-integer index cases correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
``` 

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should now handle non-integer index cases correctly, and the failing test should pass without raising a `ValueError`.
