1. The buggy function is failing when it encounters non-integer indexes and attempts to handle them based on whether they are integer or non-integer. It is throwing a `ValueError` when encountering non-integer indexes. The failing test is related to lookups for datetime64 and timedelta64 values.

2. The potential error in the code is within the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the logic that checks for the type of the index and how it handles non-integer indexes.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes properly, leading to the `ValueError` being raised when encountering non-integer indexes in the failing test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes without raising a `ValueError`.
   - Adding conditional checks to differentiate between integer and non-integer indexes and handle them appropriately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index to handle non-integer indexes.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will now properly handle integer and non-integer indexes and should pass the failing test.
