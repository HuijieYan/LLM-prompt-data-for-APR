The buggy function is `_convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False)`. This function is used to check the type of the input key based on the type of the index.

The error message states: `ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers`. This error occurs when the code tries to convert a non-integer index to an integer index.

The function checks if the type of the index is an integer and if the key is an integer. If it is not an integer, it raises an error. This behavior is incorrect as it should check if the types are compatible with the index and not just check if they are integers.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check if the type of the key is compatible with the type of the index. For numerical indexes, both float and integers should be accepted, and for datetime/timedelta indexes, the type of the key should match the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex)) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index can only have datetime or timedelta indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, (Float64Index, Int64Index)) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code should handle the different types of indexes properly and pass the failing tests.
