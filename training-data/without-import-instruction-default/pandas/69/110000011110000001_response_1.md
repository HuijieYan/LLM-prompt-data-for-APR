The buggy function is `_convert_key`. This function is responsible for ensuring that keys are the same type as the index and handling the scenario where based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers, and likewise for non-integer indexes.

The error message indicates that the function is failing when based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers.

The possible approach for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic within the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the based indexing on non-integer index condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. 
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )

    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function should now be able to pass the failing test.
