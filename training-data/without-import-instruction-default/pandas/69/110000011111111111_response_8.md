The issue is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling float values correctly for non-integer indexes. It is raising a ValueError when it shouldn't be. This is causing the failing tests in the `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` function.

The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling the case of non-integer indexes properly for float values in the key parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes properly for float values in the key parameter. Instead of raising a ValueError, we should simply check if the index is integer or not and act accordingly without raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            return i
    return key
```

This corrected function will handle non-integer indexes properly for float values in the key parameter without raising a ValueError.

With this corrected function, the failing tests should pass and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
