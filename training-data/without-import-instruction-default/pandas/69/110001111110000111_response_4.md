The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. The function checks if the key is an integer and if so, it ensures that the index also contains only integer values. If the key is not an integer, it checks if the index holds non-integer values.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing various lookups on a series with datetime or timedelta values and a float64 index. The test is expecting correct behavior for the different types of lookups.

The error message indicates that there is a ValueError raised within the `_convert_key` function when an integer key is used for a non-integer index. This error is causing the failing test.

The GitHub issue title clearly states that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, which is related to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to handle the integer and non-integer index cases correctly based on the key provided. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code specifically checks for whether the index is integer or non-integer, and raises a ValueError accordingly based on the type of the key being accessed.

With this corrected code, the failing test should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
