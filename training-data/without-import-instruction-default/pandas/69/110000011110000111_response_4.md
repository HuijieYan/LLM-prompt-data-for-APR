1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is used in the test code to convert the key before performing a lookup. The error message indicates that there is an issue with converting the key for a non-integer index. The GitHub issue also mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conversion logic for non-integer indexes.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes properly, leading to a ValueError being raised in the lookup process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include updating the logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes and ensure that the key is correctly converted for different types of indexes.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By updating the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle different types of indexes and keys, the corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
