3. The bug is likely occurring within the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised when using the `at` attribute with a non-integer index. This suggests that the conversion of the key is not handling non-integer indexes properly.

The failing test is trying to access values using the `at` attribute with both float and integer indexes, and it's failing when using the integer index.

The GitHub issue title and description indicate that the bug affects series lookups for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes when using the `at` attribute.
   - Ensure that the conversion of the key in `_convert_key` is consistent with the index type.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not np.isreal(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the `_convert_key` function has been updated to handle non-integer indexes properly. The if condition now checks if the key is not an integer and not a real number before raising a ValueError. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
