1. The buggy function is within the _AtIndexer class and the function is named _convert_key. The GitHub issue mentions the bug affecting Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the for loop where it checks the type of the index and the type of the key.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect type comparison within the for loop. The function is supposed to enforce that keys are of the same type as the index, but it seems to have incorrect logic for type checking.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the key and index types are properly checked and enforced
   - Using appropriate methods for type checking
   - Adding appropriate conditionals for handling the Float64Index case

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:  # handle other types of indexes
            if not type(ax) == type(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Keys must be of the same type as the index"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check for the Float64Index type and enforced that the key must be of type float for this case. For other types of indexes, we check if the key is of the same type as the index. This should resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
