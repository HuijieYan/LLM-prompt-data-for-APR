The issue seems to be with the _convert_key function, where it is not handling the key appropriately based on the type of index in the self.obj. The function is intended to check the type of index and the type of key being passed, and raise a ValueError if they don't match.

The bug is likely caused by the function not correctly handling the type of index when comparing it with the key. This is evident from the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values. The GitHub issue also indicates that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _convert_key function to properly handle the type of index in self.obj and compare it with the type of key being passed. Specifically, it needs to check if the key and the index have the same type, and raise a ValueError if they don't match.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now properly handle the type of index and the type of key being passed, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
