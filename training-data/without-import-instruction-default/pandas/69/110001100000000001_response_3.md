1. The buggy function _convert_key is responsible for converting the given key into the same type as the index. It checks for the type of the key and the index, and raises a ValueError if there is a mismatch. The bug seems to be related to the type checking and validation logic within the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the type checking and validation logic, where it tries to determine if the key and the index are of the same type.

3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect type checking and validation logic. The function checks if the key and the index are of the same type, but the implementation is flawed. It appears that the function is incorrectly checking if the index axes are integers or holds integers, leading to the incorrect behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include reviewing the type checking and validation logic within the function, ensuring that it correctly checks the types of the key and the index. Additionally, considering the use of built-in functions or libraries for type checking can also improve the robustness of the function.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the isinstance function is used to check if the index axes are of type pd.Int64Index, and if the key is of type int. This ensures that the type checking and validation logic is correct, addressing the bug in the original function. Additionally, the formatting of the error messages has been improved for clarity.
