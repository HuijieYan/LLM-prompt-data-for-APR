### Bug Identification

The issue is with the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class within the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function is responsible for converting the key to the correct type based on the index.

The failing tests indicate that when using `ser.at[4]`, a `ValueError` is raised because the function does not handle cases where the index is non-integer.

The GitHub issue title indicates that the bug affects corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, which aligns with the failing tests.

### Bug Cause

The `_convert_key` function is not handling cases where the index is non-integer correctly. This results in a `ValueError` being raised when it should not.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Update the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes without raising a `ValueError`.
2. Add conditional checks within the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately.

### Corrected Code

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass, and the function should work as expected, addressing the reported bug on GitHub.
