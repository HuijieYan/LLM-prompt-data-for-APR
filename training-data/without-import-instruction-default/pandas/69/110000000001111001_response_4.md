The bug in the provided function is that it is not handling the case where the index is non-integer and the key is an integer properly. It is raising a ValueError for this case, which is not expected. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle the case when the index is non-integer and the key is an integer. We can remove the ValueError raising code and simply return the key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle the cases where the index is non-integer and the key is an integer properly and will not raise any unexpected ValueError. It satisfies all the expected input/output variable information provided.
