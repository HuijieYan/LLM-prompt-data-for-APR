The problem in the _convert_key function seems to be related to the way it handles integer and non-integer indexers. The function is not properly checking for integer type and is_integer() method is not being called correctly.

The failing test is related to the at method in the test_lookups_datetimelike_values function. When using the .at[] method with an integer indexer, the function is not properly casting it to a non-integer indexer, leading to a ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function to correctly handle integer and non-integer indexers, and ensure that it properly checks for the type of the indexers.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    idx_type = type(self.obj.index)

    if idx_type == pd.Float64Index:
        key = list(key)  # make sure key is list for Float64Index

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) or isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles different types of indexers and ensures that the key is correctly converted for the Float64Index case.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".
