The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index. It currently checks whether each index axis is an integer, and if so, whether the corresponding key is also an integer. If not, it raises a ValueError.

However, the bug is caused by the fact that `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` are not defined for the index axis in this context. These functions are likely intended to check if the index axis contains only integer values, and if so, whether the key is also an integer.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to check if the index axis contains only integer values. If it does, it should check if the corresponding key is also an integer. If not, it should raise a ValueError. If the index axis contains non-integer values, the function should check if the corresponding key is also non-integer, and raise a ValueError if not.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.dtype.kind == 'i':
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")

    return key
```

This corrected function checks the dtype of the index axis to determine if it contains only integer values, and then checks the type of the key accordingly. This modification should address the issues encountered in the failing tests and error messages.
