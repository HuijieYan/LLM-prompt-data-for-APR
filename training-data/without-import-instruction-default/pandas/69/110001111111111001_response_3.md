The problem with the _convert_key function is that it is not properly handling the types of the key values based on the type of the index. The function is intended to raise a ValueError in specific cases, but it is currently raising the error in incorrect situations.

The issue is that the condition to check whether a key value is an integer is not correctly implemented, and this is causing the function to raise a ValueError in cases where it shouldn't.

To address this issue, the condition for checking whether a key value is an integer needs to be corrected. Additionally, the condition for checking whether the index holds integers should be handled separately.

Here is the corrected _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, np.int32)):
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(i, (float, np.float64)):
            if not ax.is_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_non_numeric():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function correctly handles different types of index and key values based on their compatibility. It will not raise a ValueError in cases where it is not required, and it will raise a ValueError in cases where the index and key types are incompatible.

By using this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass, and the function should satisfy the provided expected input/output variable information.
