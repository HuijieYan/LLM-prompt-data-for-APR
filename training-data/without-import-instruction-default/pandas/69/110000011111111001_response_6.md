The bug in the `_convert_key` function is that it is not handling the case where the index is non-integer properly. It should raise an error if a non-integer index is provided, but the function is not doing so correctly.

The failing test indicates that when using the `at` access method with a non-integer index (e.g., 4), it is not properly handled and is not raising a `ValueError` as expected.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function should properly check if the index is non-integer and raise a `ValueError` if a non-integer indexer is passed for a non-integer index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):
                i = float(i)
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function should now properly handle both integer and non-integer indexes and raise the `ValueError` when an inappropriate indexer is provided for the index type.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
