The buggy function `_convert_key` is supposed to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index. It iterates through the axes and keys, checking whether an axis is of type integer and if the key being checked is also an integer. If the axis is not of type integer, it then checks that the key is also not an integer. However, the method used to check for an integer (`is_integer`) does not exist, and is_integer and holds_integer are unnecessary conditions that could lead to the ValueError being raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we should remove the unnecessary conditions and use the isinstance method to check if the key is an integer. We also need to handle the case where is_setter is True and just return the key as a list.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

With this correction, the _convert_key function should now handle the input keys properly and no longer raise the ValueError incorrectly. This should make all the failing tests pass.
