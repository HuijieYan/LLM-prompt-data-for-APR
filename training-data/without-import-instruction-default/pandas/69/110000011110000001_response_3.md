The buggy function `_convert_key` is used in the failing test when calling `ser.at[4]`. The function is supposed to handle keys based on their type, ensuring consistency with the index type. However, it does not handle the scenario where an index is non-integer and the key is an integer.

The error message indicates that when `ser.at[4]` is called, it raises a `ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers`. This suggests that the function is not handling the case where an integer key is used with a non-integer index.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the case where an integer key is used with a non-integer index. One approach to fix this is to check the type of the index and the key, and raise an appropriate error if they are incompatible.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, float) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This updated version of the `_convert_key` function checks if the index is non-integer and the key is an integer. If this is the case, it raises the expected `ValueError` for the failing test.
