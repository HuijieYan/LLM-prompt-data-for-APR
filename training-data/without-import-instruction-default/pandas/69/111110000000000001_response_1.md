1. The buggy function is called _convert_key and is a method of the _AtIndexer class. It is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition checks for whether the index is an integer and if the key is also an integer.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the condition checks for whether the index and key are integers may not be working as expected, leading to incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the condition checks for whether the index and key are integers and ensuring they are correctly implemented.
   - Testing the function with different types of indexes and keys to identify the specific scenario where the bug occurs.
   - Adding more explicit error messages to provide better clarity on the cause of the issue.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
            elif ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the condition checks have been modified to correctly identify whether the index and key are integers or non-integers. The error messages have also been modified to provide better clarity on the cause of the issue.
