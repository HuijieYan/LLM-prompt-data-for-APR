The issue is related to the `_convert_key` function in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The function is intended to require keys to be the same type as the index in non-setter cases. However, it currently raises a `ValueError` for non-integer indexers even when the index is non-integer, which is causing the failing test cases.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly, leading to the `ValueError` being raised improperly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function so that it can handle non-integer indexers correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check to ensure that non-integer indexers are only allowed for non-integer indexes.

With this correction, the failing test cases should pass, and the issue posted on GitHub should be resolved.
