The buggy function is `_convert_key` which is trying to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index. It checks for integer and non-integer keys based on the index type.

The specific error message is `ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers`.

The issue is caused by the `else` block in the `_convert_key` function that checks for non-integer indexes. It incorrectly raises a `ValueError` if the index is non-integer.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `else` block and move the condition to the outer level. Also, there is a missing implementation inside the for loop that iterates over the keys with the index. We need to modify the function to correctly handle integer and non-integer indexes.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
The corrected function will handle integer and non-integer indexes appropriately and satisfy the failing test.
