The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the `_AtIndexer` class located in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. This function is responsible for converting the keys into the same type as the index. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` is testing the behavior of indexing with floating point keys.

The failing test is throwing a `ValueError` with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This indicates that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexers properly when using "at" based indexing.

The related GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that there are corner cases affecting `Float64Index.get_value`, which is in line with the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to properly handle non-integer indexers when using "at" based indexing. It should check the type of the indexer and ensure that it matches the type of the index.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-float indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function specifically checks for `Float64Index` and handles float indexers accordingly. It also ensures that non-float indexers are handled correctly for other types of indexes. With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should now handle non-integer indexers properly when using "at" based indexing, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
