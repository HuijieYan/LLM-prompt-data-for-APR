The bug is located in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function is used to convert the key for indexing purpose, and it currently has an issue with handling non-integer indexers.

The cause of the bug appears to be an incorrect check for integer indexers. The function attempts to check whether the indexers are integers using the `is_integer()` method, but this method is not defined in the context where it is being used. Additionally, the function references a non-existent `is_integer()` method.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to correctly check for integer indexers.

In the corrected code, the `is_integer()` method should be replaced with an accurate method for checking if the indexer is an integer. This can be done using the `isinstance(i, int)` method. Additionally, the non-existent `is_integer()` method should be removed.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
This corrected version of the function should address the bug and ensure that the failing test case passes successfully.
