The provided buggy function is `_convert_key` and it seems to be creating an issue with the index conversion for float values. The failing test is related to a `Float64Index` and it seems that the function is not handling the conversion correctly for float values.

The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly. It fails when an integer index is passed to a non-integer index.

Based on the failing test, it seems that the function is not properly checking the type of the index and the input value before performing the conversion.

The GitHub issue title for this bug could be, "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to properly handle the conversion for float values. It needs to check the type of the index and the input value to ensure that only applicable conversions are performed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```

This corrected function should handle both integer and float indexes properly, and it should pass the failing test. It also addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

With this corrected function, the failing test case should pass, and the expected input/output variable information should be satisfied. The GitHub issue should also be resolved with the implementation of this fix.
