The buggy function `_convert_key` is intended to require keys to be the same type as the index. However, there are a few issues in the function that need to be addressed.

The potential error location within the function is in the for loop where the type of the index is checked. It seems there might be a mismatch in the type checking, as it's trying to compare an integer type with a non-integer type.

The bug's cause is related to the mismatch in type checking for integer and non-integer indexes. This is resulting in incorrect error messages and exceptions being raised, affecting series lookups for the Float64Index case as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Correcting the type checking logic to properly handle cases where the index is an integer or non-integer type.
2. Ensuring that the error messages and exceptions raised are appropriate for the specific cases.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes proper type checking for integer and non-integer indexes, and raises the appropriate error messages based on the type of index and indexer. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
