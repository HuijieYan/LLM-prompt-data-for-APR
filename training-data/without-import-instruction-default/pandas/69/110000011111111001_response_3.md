The problematic function `_convert_key` is intended to check whether the key is of the same type as the index. However, the implementation contains various issues. The main problem stems from the use of `is_integer(i)` which is incorrect.

In the failing test, the error message indicates that when key (4,) is used, it raises a ValueError with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This occurs because the key 4 is being treated as a non-integer even though it is an integer.

To fix the buggy function, the use of `is_integer()` needs to be replaced with checking the type of the index and key to ensure they are compatible. Additionally, the logic for checking the type of the index should be based on the actual dtype of the index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (or compatible type).
    """
    index_type = self.obj.dtype.type
    key_type = type(key) if not is_setter else list

    if index_type != key_type:
        raise ValueError("Key type must match the index type")

    return key
```

By checking the types of the index and the key and ensuring they are compatible in the `_convert_key` function, the corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
