The bug in the `_convert_key` function is caused by the checks for integer types. The function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly, leading to a ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexers properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should handle both integer and non-integer indexers properly and pass the failing test cases.
