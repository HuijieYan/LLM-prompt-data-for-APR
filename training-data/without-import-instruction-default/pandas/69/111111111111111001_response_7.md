The issue seems to be with the `_convert_key` function. It is currently raising a ValueError when using non-integer values for integer indexes and vice versa. The input includes both integer and non-integer values, but the function is not handling this properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer values appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This modified function first checks if the index is an integer index and if the corresponding key is not an integer, it raises a ValueError. Similarly, if the index is not an integer index and the key is an integer, it raises a ValueError. Otherwise, it returns the key.

This should fix the bug and make the function handle both integer and non-integer values correctly.

This corrected function should now satisfy all the provided failing test cases and corresponding expected input/output variable information.
