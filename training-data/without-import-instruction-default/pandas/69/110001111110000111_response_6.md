The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert the key based on the type of the index, with a specific check for integer types. The issue arises when using the `ser.at[4]` method, as it raises a ValueError due to the non-integer index with an integer indexer.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in `test_numeric.py` is testing the behavior of various index lookup methods on a Series with a Float64Index.

The main cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function does not correctly handle the case when using `ser.at[4]` with a non-integer index and an integer indexer.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle the case when using `ser.at[4]` with a non-integer index and an integer indexer. The function should check if the index is non-integer and the indexer is an integer, and in that case, it should raise a ValueError.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds the necessary checks to handle the case when using `ser.at[4]` with a non-integer index and an integer indexer.

By applying this fix, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported in the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" should be resolved.
