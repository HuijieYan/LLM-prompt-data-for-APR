The buggy function `_convert_key` is intended to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index. However, it currently raises a ValueError for non-integer indexes when it should not.

The failing test is testing Series lookups with float and integer indices, and the error message indicates that the buggy function is raising a ValueError for non-integer indexes when it shouldn't.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that there are corner cases in the `get_value` method for DatetimeIndex and Float64Index.


Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function when it raises a ValueError for non-integer indexes that should permit non-integer indexers.


Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function, resulting in a ValueError being raised when it should not.


Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes without raising a ValueError.
2. Check the index type and if it is non-integer, allow non-integer indexers without raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            # Check if the index is non-integer and continue without raising an error
            pass

    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle non-integer indexes correctly without raising a ValueError. It will allow non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes. This fix should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
