The problem in the buggy function lies in the logic for checking the type of index and the type of key when using the `get_value` method. The function is not handling the cases where the index is not an integer type, and the key is an integer or vice versa.

The failing test is checking for the behavior of the `get_value` method with different types of keys and indexes. The test is failing because the function is not properly handling the cases where the index and the key are of different types.

The GitHub issue title suggests that this bug is affecting corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, indicating that the bug is related to the behavior of these methods for specific cases.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle cases where the index and the key are of different types. It should check the type of the index and compare it with the type of the key to determine if the combination is valid.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle different types of indexes and keys appropriately. The function should check the type of the index and compare it with the type of the key to ensure compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, or handle specific cases for different types. 
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            continue
        elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            continue
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Mismatched type between index and key"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function adds additional checks to handle cases where the index and the key are of different types appropriately.

By using this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and the function should behave as expected for the provided input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
