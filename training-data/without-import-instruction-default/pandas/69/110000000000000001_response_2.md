1. The buggy function is intended to convert a key into the same type as the index. It checks if the key is an integer and if it matches the index type, and throws ValueError if it doesn't.

2. The potential error locations within the function are the conditionals that check if the key is an integer and if it matches the index type.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly checking whether the key matches the index type, and it is also comparing the key type with the index type incorrectly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use the `is_integer` method correctly to check if the key is an integer.
   - Use the `holds_integer` method to check if the index holds integers.
   - Compare the type of the key with the type of the index.
   - Handle the cases where the key doesn't match the index type.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the `is_integer` method is replaced with `isinstance(i, int)`, and the comparison with index type is also corrected using `holds_integer` method. Additionally, the conditionals are modified to handle the cases where the key doesn't match the index type.
