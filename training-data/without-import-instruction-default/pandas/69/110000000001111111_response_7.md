The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the check for whether the index is an integer or not, and then comparing it with the type of the indexer. Based on the discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable value and the GitHub Issue information, it seems that the function is not handling the cases where the index and the indexer are of different types (e.g., integer index with non-integer indexer, and vice versa) correctly.

The bug's cause seems to be that the function is not properly checking for the compatibility of the index and the indexer when they are of different types.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly check the types of the index and the indexer and raise a ValueError if they are not compatible.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
            )
        if isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function now explicitly checks for the compatibility of the index and the indexer based on their types, and raises a ValueError if they are not compatible. This should resolve the issue with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.
