Potential error location: The potential error lies in the logic for checking if the index is an integer and if the indexer is an integer.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function (_convert_key) is responsible for converting the key based on certain conditions.
(b). The related function, DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value, are affected by the bug, leading to series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.
(c). The GitHub issue information indicates that there are corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of index and ensure that the key is of the same type.
2. Update the logic for checking if the index is an integer and if the indexer is an integer.
3. Handle corner cases for DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """

    idx_type = type(self.obj.axes[0])

    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, idx_type):
            if not isinstance(i, idx_type):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an {idx_type} index "
                    f"can only have {idx_type} indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, idx_type) and not isinstance(ax, idx_type):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an non-{idx_type} "
                    f"index can only have non-{idx_type} "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
The corrected code ensures that the keys are of the same type as the index and handles the corner cases for DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value.
