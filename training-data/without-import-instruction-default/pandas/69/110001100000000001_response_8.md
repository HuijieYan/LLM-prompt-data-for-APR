Potential error in the code:
The potential error in the code lies in the condition check for whether the index is an integer or not, as well as the check for whether the given input is an integer or not.

Bugâ€™s cause:
The buggy function is not properly checking whether the index and the input are integers or non-integers, leading to potential ValueError being raised erroneously.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and the input separately before comparing them.
2. Use the built-in functions to check if the index and the input are integers or non-integers.

The corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we explicitly check the type of the index and the input using the `isinstance` function to determine if they are integer type or non-integer type. Additionally, we also use the `pd.Int64Index` class to specifically check if the index is an integer index.
