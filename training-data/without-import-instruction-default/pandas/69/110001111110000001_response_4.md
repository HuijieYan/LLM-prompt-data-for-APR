The buggy function `_convert_key` is called when a key is being converted for indexing purposes. The error occurs when trying to use this function for an index of non-integer type with a non-integer key.

The specific issue arises from this part of the error message:
```
if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
```
The error indicates that when an index is not of an integer type, the key must also not be an integer. But in the failing test, the key is provided as an integer, causing the error.


Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition checking `if is_integer(i)` to check if the index holds an integer, and if so, the key should also be an integer.
2. Since the error is raised in the else block, it indicates the condition for non-integer indexes. However, the message seems to be in contradiction with the condition. This should be reviewed and corrected as needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.holds_integer():  # Check if the index holds an integer
            if not is_integer(i):  # If it holds an integer, then the key should also be an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):  # If it does not hold an integer, then the key should not be an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and not raise any error.
