The potential error in the buggy function is the logic that checks whether the index is an integer type or not. The function checks if the index is an integer, and if so, it only allows integer indexers. Similarly, if the index is a non-integer, it only allows non-integer indexers. However, in the provided examples, the key is a mix of integer and float types, which leads to the function raising a ValueError.

The issue on GitHub titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the discrepancies observed in the input/output variable values.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to allow the key to consist of both integer and float types when the index is a Float64Index. A possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to allow mixed integer and float type key values when the index is a Float64Index.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.dtype != 'float64':
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will now allow mixed integer and float type key values when the index is a Float64Index, thus resolving the issue reported on GitHub and satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
