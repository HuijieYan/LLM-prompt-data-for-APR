1. The buggy function is a method called `_convert_key` which is used for converting keys based on certain conditions. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is testing the behavior of the `get_value` method of the Float64Index.
The error message indicates that the ValueError is being raised in the `_convert_key` function, which suggests that there may be an issue with the type conversion logic within the function.

2. The potential error location within the function is the type checking logic within the `for` loop that checks the type of each index.

3. The bug is caused by the type checking logic in the `_convert_key` function not handling certain cases correctly, resulting in a ValueError being raised when it shouldn't be. The failing test is testing the behavior of the `get_value` method for the Float64Index, which is impacted by the incorrect behavior of the `_convert_key` function. The GitHub issue states that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the type checking logic within the `_convert_key` function and ensuring that it correctly handles the cases for Float64Index.
   - Checking if the type conversion is accurately capturing the behavior required for the key conversion.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.holds_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle the type checking logic correctly and pass the failing test, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
