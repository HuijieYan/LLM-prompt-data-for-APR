The potential error in the `_convert_key` function lies in the condition where it checks if an indexer is an integer or not. The function raises a `ValueError` if the index is non-integer and the provided indexer is an integer.

The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling integer indexers correctly if the index is non-integer. The error message specifically states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to handle integer indexers correctly based on the type of the index. If the index type is non-integer, the function should allow both integer and non-integer indexers. If the index type is integer, the function should only allow integer indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_convert_key` function that satisfies the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks the type of the index and handles integer and non-integer indexers accordingly. It should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
