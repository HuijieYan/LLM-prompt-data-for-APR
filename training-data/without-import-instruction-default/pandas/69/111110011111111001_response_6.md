The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert the input key based on specific conditions. It is causing a `ValueError` when encountering a non-integer index and a non-integer indexer.

The issue seems to be occurring due to the inconsistency in the handling of integer and non-integer indexes and indexers within the function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_convert_key` function to handle integer and non-integer cases separately. 

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks if the type of the indexer matches the type of the index, handling integer and non-integer indexers and indexes differently.

This corrected code should resolve the `ValueError` issue and satisfy all the failing test cases, allowing the function to work as expected.
