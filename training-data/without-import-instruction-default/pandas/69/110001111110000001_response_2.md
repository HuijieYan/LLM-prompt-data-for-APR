The buggy function `_convert_key` is used by the indexing methods in the pandas library to convert the keys provided by the user into a valid format. The error message indicates that when using the `.at` method for indexing, it's raising a ValueError when the input key is an integer, but the index does not hold integer values.

The issue lies within the loop that iterates over the axes of the index and compares them with the keys provided. It is not correctly handling cases where the index is non-integer and the key is an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle cases where an index is non-integer and the key is an integer. One approach could be to check the type of the key and the index, and then handle them accordingly.

The corrected version of the `_convert_key` function could look like the following:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this updated logic, the `_convert_key` function should now be able to handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly, causing the failing test to pass.
