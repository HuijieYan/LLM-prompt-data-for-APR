The root cause of the bug seems to be that the function is not correctly handling the type of the index and the type of the key when comparing them. This is leading to incorrect error messages being raised for certain cases, particularly when dealing with float values in the key and index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that compares the types of the index and the key to determine whether to raise a ValueError.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the data types of the key and the index when comparing them, leading to incorrect error messages being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section that compares the types of the key and the index. We should handle float and int types separately to avoid raising incorrect error messages. 

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, np.int64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, np.int64) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should handle the different data types of the key and the index correctly and avoid raising incorrect error messages. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
