The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert a key to the same type as the index but it is currently not handling the case when the index is non-integer. The failing test is testing the behavior of index lookups with non-integer values. The error message specifically states that "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers", indicating that the issue is within the conditional block for non-integer indexes.

The issue lies within the conditional block for non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function. It raises a `ValueError` when the key is an integer and the index doesn't hold integers, which is not the desired behavior.

One approach to fixing this issue is to modify the conditional block for non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function to allow for non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # Changed the condition to allow for non-integer indexers
            # No need to check for is_integer(i) as non-integer index can have non-integer indexers
            continue
                
    return key
```

This corrected code will allow for non-integer indexers when the index itself is non-integer, and it should pass the failing test.
