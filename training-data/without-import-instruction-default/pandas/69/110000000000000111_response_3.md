1. The buggy function is a method that is related to indexing in a data structure, likely a DataFrame or a Series. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case. This suggests that the problematic function is likely involved in the lookup or retrieval of values from the data structure.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional checks for integer and non-integer indexes. The function is checking the type of index values and raising errors based on certain conditions.

3. The bug may be caused by incorrect logic in the conditional checks for index type, leading to errors being raised improperly. The GitHub issue indicates that this is affecting Series lookups for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the conditional checks in the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the conditional checks in the function to ensure they accurately reflect the requirements for index type in the specific case of Float64Index.
   - Updating the error messages to provide clear information about the issue and how to resolve it.
   - Testing the function with different types of indexes to verify that it correctly handles the conditions for the Float64Index case.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "Non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been updated to use `isinstance` to accurately check the type of index values. The error messages have been refined to provide clear information about the specific conditions that are not met. This should address the issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
