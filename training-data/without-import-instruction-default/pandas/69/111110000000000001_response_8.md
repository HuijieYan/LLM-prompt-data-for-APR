1. The buggy function is a method called `_convert_key` within the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is responsible for converting the key used for indexing, ensuring that it matches the type of the index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that checks whether the index is an integer or not, and then compares it with the type of the index.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the cases where the key and index do not match types properly. This can lead to incorrect indexing and potential errors in the program.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to rewrite the logic for checking the types of the key and index to ensure they match properly. Another approach is to add proper type checking and handling for different cases, with appropriate error messages.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # The corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if i is an integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():  # Check if i is not an integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
