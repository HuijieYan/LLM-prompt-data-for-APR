The problem with the `_convert_key` function is that it is not correctly handling the type comparison for keys being passed. It is raising a ValueError when it should not be doing so. The issue arises from the check for whether a key can be converted to an integer or not. This check is incorrect and is causing the ValueError to be raised in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the type comparison for keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):
            raise ValueError("Key type does not match the index type")
    return key
```

This corrected code will properly compare the type of the key with the type of the index and raise a ValueError if they do not match. This will ensure that the failing tests pass and the function behaves as expected.
