Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the comparison logic inside the for loop in the _convert_key function. Specifically, the logic for checking whether the index is an integer or not and comparing it with the type of the key is causing the problem.

Bug's cause: The function is not properly checking the type of the index and the type of the key, leading to incorrect comparisons and error messages being raised in some cases. This is causing the function to fail and produce incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and the type of the key separately and compare them accordingly.
2. Use the appropriate functions or methods to check for integer values and types.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) != ax.is_integer():
            if ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            else:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks the type of the key and compares it with the type of the index separately, ensuring that the comparisons are done correctly and the appropriate error messages are raised. This will fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
