The buggy function `_convert_key` is meant to convert the key based on certain conditions and return the modified key. The issue lies in the logic inside the function.

The failing test is checking the lookup functionality for different types of index values, namely datetime and timedelta. When using the `at` based indexing, it fails with a `ValueError` stating "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

This indicates that the logic inside the `_convert_key` function is not properly handling the different types of index values, resulting in the ValueError. The function should be able to handle both non-integer and integer indexers.

To fix this bug, the logic inside the `_convert_key` function should be modified to properly handle different types of index values. It should check the type of index and handle the conversion of key accordingly.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles the different types of index values and ensures that the key is converted based on the type of the index, resolving the issue with the failing test.
