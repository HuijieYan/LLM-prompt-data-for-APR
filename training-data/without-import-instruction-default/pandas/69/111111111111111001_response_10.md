The `key` parameter is expected to be a tuple of float values, but the `_convert_key` function is treating the input as potentially integer. This leads to a ValueError being raised when non-integer values are encountered. 

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to handle tuples of float values properly, without assuming they could be integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i):
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This change ensures that the function properly checks for integer and non-integer indexers based on the type of the index and the type of the key being passed. This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
