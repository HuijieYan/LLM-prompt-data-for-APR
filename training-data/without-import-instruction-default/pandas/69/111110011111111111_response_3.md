Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` function when checking whether the index is integer or non-integer.

Bug cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the key when checking if it is an integer or non-integer. This results in a ValueError being raised when it shouldn't be.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the key is an integer or non-integer and handle the cases accordingly.
2. Use the correct method to check if the key is an integer.
3. Ensure that the function handles both integer and non-integer indexes properly.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, np.int32)):
            if not ax.is_type_compatible(np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_type_compatible(np.floating):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected function now properly checks if the key is an integer or non-integer and raises a ValueError only in the appropriate cases. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
