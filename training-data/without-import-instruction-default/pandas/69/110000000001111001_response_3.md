The bug in the function is likely caused by the conditional checks for integer values, which are incorrect. The function is not properly checking whether the input key matches the type of the index, and the conditions for checking integer types are not accurate.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and the logic for handling integer and non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It accurately checks the type of the index and the type of the input key, raising a ValueError if the types do not match as expected.
