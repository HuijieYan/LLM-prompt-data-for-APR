The problematic function `_convert_key` is used within the class `_AtIndexer` to convert keys to the same type as the index. The potential error within the function is located in the for loop where it checks if the index is an integer. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `is_integer` function and the mishandling of the conditions for integer and non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, we can use the appropriate method to check if the index is an integer and then handle the conditions for integer and non-integer indexes separately.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, we have used the `isinstance` function to check if the index is an instance of `pd.Int64Index` and `int` or `np.integer`. We then handle the conditions for integer and non-integer indexes separately, ensuring a more reliable and accurate conversion of the keys.
