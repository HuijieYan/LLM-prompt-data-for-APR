The buggy function is `_convert_key` inside the class `_AtIndexer`. The function is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index, but there is an issue with handling non-integer indexes.

The failing test is testing the lookups for datetime64 or timedelta64 values, and the error message indicates that there is a problem with non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers.

The GitHub issue title suggests that the bug is related to corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, indicating that it may be a problem specific to handling float indexes and float indexers.

To fix the bug, we will need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should properly handle the cases of non-integer indexes and non-integer indexers and pass the failing test. It also addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
