Potential error location: The bug may be occurring in the section of code that checks whether the index is an integer and the indexer matches that type.

Bug Cause: The bug is likely caused by the function not properly handling floating-point and integer indexes.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index and the key have the same type before performing the comparison.
2. Handle floating-point and integer indexes separately to avoid the mismatch.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks the type of the index and handles floating-point and integer indexes separately to ensure that the indexer matches the type of the index. This will address the issue with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case and resolve the bug.
