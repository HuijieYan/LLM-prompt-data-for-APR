1. The buggy function _convert_key is part of the class _AtIndexer, which is a subclass of _ScalarAccessIndexer.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if-else statements where it checks if the key is an integer or not.

3. (a) The buggy function is supposed to convert keys to be the same type as the index and check if the key is an integer or not.
   (b) The buggy class _AtIndexer is using this function to handle key conversions and type checking for indexing.

4. To fix the bug, we can:
   - Modify the logic in the if-else statements to correctly check if the key is an integer or not, based on the requirements.
   - Handle the cases where the key and index types are not matching appropriately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
        """
        # Allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):  # Check if the key is an integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():  # Check if the key is not an integer
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
This corrected code ensures that the key and index types are appropriately checked and handled, fixing the bug in the original function.
