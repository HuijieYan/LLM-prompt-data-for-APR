The issue seems to be with the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class. The problem arises because the function attempts to check if the keys match the type of the index, but the logic is incorrect and leads to a ValueError being raised.

It's important to note that the logic of the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class should be such that it checks if the provided keys match the type of the index and raises a ValueError if they don't.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the type-checking logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not is_integer(i) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This updated function correctly checks if the keys match the type of the index and raises a ValueError if they don't. It should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
