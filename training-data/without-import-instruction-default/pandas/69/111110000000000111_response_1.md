1. The buggy function is a part of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The GitHub issue mentions that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error within the problematic function lies in the validation of the keys and their types.

3. (a). The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for validating the keys to be the same type as the index.
   (b). The `_AtIndexer` class is related to the issue, as it contains the buggy function which is causing the problem with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.
   (c). The GitHub issue information confirms that series lookups are affected specifically for the Float64Index case, indicating that the bug is likely related to the key validation and conversion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Refactor the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the validation of keys based on the index type.
   - Ensure that the key validation process is compatible with the Float64Index case to resolve the issue affecting series lookups.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                if not isinstance(i, datetime.datetime):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a DatetimeIndex can only have datetime indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected code includes additional checks for the index type, specifically for `pd.Float64Index` and `pd.DatetimeIndex`. It ensures that the key validation is compatible with these index types. This should resolve the issue affecting series lookups for the Float64Index case.
