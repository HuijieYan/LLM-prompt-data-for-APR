The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `Indexing` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is designed to convert the key to match the type of the index.

The failing test is trying to test lookups for datetime and timedelta values using the `get_value` method, and it's throwing a `ValueError` with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

The issue in the `_convert_key` function seems to be with the logic that checks if the index is an integer or non-integer index and whether the key is an integer or non-integer.

The GitHub issue title suggests that the bug is related to corner cases in `DTI.get_value`, `Float64Index.get_value`. This aligns with the failing test's attempt to test lookups for different types of values.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `_convert_key` function needs to be adjusted to properly handle integer and non-integer cases for the index and key.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function could be as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```

This corrected code adds clear conditions to handle the cases where the index is an integer or non-integer and ensures that the key matches the type of the index. This should resolve the issue and ensure the function passes the failing test.
