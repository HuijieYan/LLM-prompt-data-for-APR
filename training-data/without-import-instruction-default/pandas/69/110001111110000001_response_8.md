The buggy function `_convert_key` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py` is intended to handle key conversions for indexing in a DataFrame. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is throwing a `ValueError` for "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The cause of the bug lies in the logic of the `_convert_key` function. It currently checks whether the index is an integer, but it should be checking whether it's a float, as the index is being cast to `"float64"` in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the `is_integer()` check should be replaced with a check for `is_float()` and `holds_integer()` should be replaced with `holds_float()` for non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_float():
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_float(i) and not ax.holds_float():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-float indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With these changes, the `_convert_key` function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
