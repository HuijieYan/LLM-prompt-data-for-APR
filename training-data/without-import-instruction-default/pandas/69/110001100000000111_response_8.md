The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key based on the index type. The bug seems to be related to the data type checking and indexing for `Float64Index`. The GitHub issue title indicates that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, which suggests that there are issues with these functions when dealing with series lookups.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function seems to be in the conditional checks for integer and non-integer values. It appears that the function is not handling the cases for `Float64Index` and non-integer values properly.

The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect type checking and handling for `Float64Index` cases. The use of `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods seems to be causing the issue, as they might not be handling `Float64Index` properly. The GitHub issue also supports this, indicating that series lookups are affected for the `Float64Index` case.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to update the type checking and indexing logic to properly handle `Float64Index` cases. This may involve updating the conditional checks and type validation to account for `Float64` type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
