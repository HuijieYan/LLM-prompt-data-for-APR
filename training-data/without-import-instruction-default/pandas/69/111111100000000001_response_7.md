1. The buggy function is part of the _AtIndexer class in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. This class is inheriting from _ScalarAccessIndexer and has a method called _convert_key, which is responsible for converting the key to a specific type based on the index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional block that checks if the index is an integer or not, and then raises a ValueError based on the type of the index and the type of the indexer.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly checking the type of the index and the type of the indexer, leading to possible mismatched types and incorrect error raising. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior when using the function for indexing.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the type of the index and the indexer separately and handle the conditions accordingly.
   - Use built-in functions or methods to check the type of the index and the indexer more accurately.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the type of the index and the indexer is checked using the isinstance() function with the appropriate types. This ensures that the type checking is done accurately and the error messages are raised correctly based on the conditions.
