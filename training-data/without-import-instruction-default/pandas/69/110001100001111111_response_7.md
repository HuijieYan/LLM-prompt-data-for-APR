Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in the condition checking for integer values and the usage of the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods. The function is not correctly handling cases where the index type is a `Float64Index` or `TimedeltaIndex`.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the different index types and their corresponding integer checks. The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is due to the function incorrectly handling the input index and key types.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add specific checks for `Float64Index` and `TimedeltaIndex` to handle integer indexing based on the index type.
2. Use the appropriate methods for checking integer values based on the index type.

The Corrected Code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, so we don't fallback.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code handles the different index types (including `Float64Index` and `TimedeltaIndex`) and appropriately checks for integer values based on the index type. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
