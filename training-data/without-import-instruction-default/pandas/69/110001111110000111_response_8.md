Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue lies within the `_convert_key` function, particularly in the logic that checks for integer and non-integer indexes.

The failing test is testing for lookups on a Float64Index and encountering a ValueError related to non-integer indexers. This suggests that the `_convert_key` function is not handling the conversion of keys correctly for Float64Index.

The error message indicates that the issue is related to the specific block of code in the `_convert_key` function that checks for integer and non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the key conversion for Float64Index and properly validate integer and non-integer indexers.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. 
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and not ax.holds_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function should now correctly handle the key conversion for Float64Index and validate integer and non-integer indexers. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
