The issue is with the `_convert_key` function which is not handling the case of non-integer index properly. Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that when the index is non-integer, the function is raising a ValueError incorrectly.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when the index is non-integer. It should only raise a ValueError if the index is non-integer and the key is an integer.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle the case of non-integer index. It should only raise a ValueError if the index is non-integer and the key is an integer.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function should handle both integer and non-integer indexes properly, and it should pass the failing test. This should also resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
