The problematic function `_convert_key` is used to convert the key into a format compatible with the index. It checks if the key is of the same type as the index and if not, it raises a ValueError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for integer and non-integer indexes. The check seems to be incorrect and may be causing the bug.

The bug's cause, as per the GitHub issue, is affecting Series lookups for the Float64Index case. This means that there might be issues with indexing and retrieving values from a Series when the index is a Float64Index.

To fix the bug, potential approaches could include:
1. Review and rewrite the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes to ensure it is correctly identifying the index type.
2. Verify how the function interacts with Series and float64 indexes to identify any specific issues related to this combination.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        elif not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
``` 

This corrected code ensures that the key and index are of the same type and should address the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
