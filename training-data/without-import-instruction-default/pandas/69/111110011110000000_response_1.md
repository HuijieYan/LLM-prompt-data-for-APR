The issue in the buggy function `_convert_key` is that it is not handling the case where `key` is not a list in the setter scenario. We need to check if `key` is not a list before returning it in the setter scenario. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            return [key]
        return key

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected version of the function, the failing tests should pass without raising ValueError.
