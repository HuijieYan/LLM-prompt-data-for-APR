The buggy function is the `_convert_key` method within the `_AtIndexer` class. This method is used to convert input keys into the correct format based on the type of index being used.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that iterates through the axes and keys to perform type checking. The issue seems to be with the type checking logic within this loop, which is not correctly handling cases where the index is a Float64Index or a DatetimeIndex.

The bug's cause is that the type checking logic does not properly handle cases where the index is a Float64Index or a DatetimeIndex, leading to incorrect type checking and potentially allowing for invalid keys to be returned.

To fix the bug, the type checking logic needs to be updated to properly handle cases where the index is a Float64Index or a DatetimeIndex. This may involve checking the type of the index and performing different type checks based on the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i) and not pd.api.types.is_string(i) and not pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing can only have integer, float, string, or datetime indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code includes updated type checking logic to properly handle cases where the index is a Float64Index or a DatetimeIndex, as well as providing a general catch-all for other index types. This should properly handle the type conversion and prevent invalid keys from being returned.
