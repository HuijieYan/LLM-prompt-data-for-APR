The issue seems to be that the function is not correctly handling the type of index and the type of the key when performing lookups in the Series. The function is not checking whether the index and key have the same type, causing issues when the index is not an integer index.

The bug is likely located in the conditional checks for the type of the index and the type of the key. It seems that the function is not handling non-integer indexes correctly.

The bug's cause originates from the function's failure to perform proper type checking and handling for non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle both integer and non-integer indexes. The conditional checks for the type of the index and the type of the key need to be revised to accommodate different index types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (Int64Index, Float64Index)) and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(ax, (Int64Index, Float64Index)) and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles both integer and non-integer indexes correctly and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
