The buggy function `_convert_key` is meant to handle keys for the index, but it appears that there is a mismatch between the types of the index and the keys provided. The error message indicates that for a non-integer index, only non-integer indexers are allowed.

The issue seems to be in the for loop where it's checking the type of the index and the key. It is not handling the case where the index and key types don't match properly.

To fix the bug, the function should check whether the index and key types match and handle them accordingly. It can be modified to compare the types of the index and the key and allow setting arbitrary indices if specified. If the types don't match, it should raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if type(i) != type(ax[0]):
            raise ValueError(
                "Key type does not match the index type"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version checks the type of each key against the type of the index and raises a ValueError if they don't match. It also allows arbitrary setting if the `is_setter` parameter is True. This function should now handle the keys and index types properly and pass the failing test.
