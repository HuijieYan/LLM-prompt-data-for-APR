Potential Error Location:
The issue may lie in the loop that iterates through the axes and keys. The type checking and validation within this loop may not be functioning as intended, leading to incorrect behavior.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function "_convert_key" is part of the _AtIndexer class, which is a subclass of _ScalarAccessIndexer. The purpose of this function is to convert the key based on certain criteria.
(b). The discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable values stem from the type validation within the function. The function is not correctly handling different types of keys when compared to the index, leading to unexpected behavior.
(c). The GitHub issue indicates that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, pointing towards an issue with indexing and retrieval of values from the Series.
(d). The GitHub issue title suggests that there are corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value, which align with the behavior described in the failing test cases.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Revise the type checking and validation logic in the _convert_key function to properly handle different types of keys and indices.
2. Ensure that the function accounts for corner cases, particularly when dealing with Float64Index and timedelta64 types.
3. Test the function with various input combinations to verify that it correctly handles different types of keys and indices.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, timedelta64):
            if not isinstance(i, (np.timedelta64, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta64 index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Unsupported index type"
            )
    return key
```
The corrected code includes updated type checking and validation logic to properly handle different types of indices. It distinguishes between Float64Index and timedelta64 types, validating the keys accordingly. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
