Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the if statement checking for integer values. The function is currently using the `is_integer()` function, which is not defined for the `ax` variable.

Bug cause: The `is_integer()` function is not defined for the `ax` variable, which is causing the code to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the value is an integer using the `isinstance()` function instead of `is_integer()`.
2. Also, update the condition to check for non-integer values appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and isinstance(ax, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
