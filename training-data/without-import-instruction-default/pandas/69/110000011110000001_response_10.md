1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is being used within the test code to convert a key and it's showing a ValueError.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is the condition that checks if the index holds an integer.

3. The bug is caused by the `_convert_key` function raising a ValueError when it shouldn't as it is failing the test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing the logic within the `_convert_key` function to ensure that it appropriately handles the conversion of keys based on the index type.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The correction involves using `pd.api.types.is_integer` method to check if `i` is an integer, instead of `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods which are not available in the current context. With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should behave as expected and pass the failing test.
