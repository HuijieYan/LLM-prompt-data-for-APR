The problematic function `_convert_key` is causing a ValueError related to indexing with non-integer values. The error message clearly states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This means that the function is expecting non-integer indexes but the inputs are being treated as if they are integers.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` checks to properly account for the input data type, and ensure that the input data type matches the index data type.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(i, type(ax)):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on a {type(ax).__name__} index can only have {type(ax).__name__} indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This updated code snippet checks for the data type of the input 'i' to match the data type of the index. If there's a mismatch, it raises a ValueError accordingly.

With this change, the function should be able to handle different data types for the index properly, and the failing test should pass.
