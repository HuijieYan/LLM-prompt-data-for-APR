The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` function when checking the types of the index against the types of the keys. The issue arises from the incorrect usage of the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` functions and comparing keys of type `int` and `float` with the index types.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the type of the index should be revised. If the index type is `float`, the key value should also be a `float`, and if the index type is `integer`, the key value should also be an `integer`. The existing checks for non-integer keys on a float index and float keys on a non-integer index are not necessary.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected implementation checks the type of the index and the corresponding key type and raises a `ValueError` only if they do not match. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected for all the provided test cases.
