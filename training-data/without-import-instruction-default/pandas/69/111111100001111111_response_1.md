Potential error location:
The potential error in the function `_convert_key` seems to be in the if-else conditions where it is checking for the type of the index and the type of the key. The function is not handling the case where the index is a DateTime or a Timedelta index.

Bug cause:
The bug is likely caused by the function not handling DateTime or Timedelta indexes properly. The function is checking if the index is an integer index, but it should also check if the index is a DateTime or a Timedelta index and handle the key conversion accordingly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index (integer, DateTime, Timedelta) and handle the key conversion based on the index type.
2. Add separate conditions to handle DateTime and Timedelta indexes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, np.datetime64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a DateTime index "
                    "can only have DateTime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, np.timedelta64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Timedelta index "
                    "can only have Timedelta indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles the different types of indexes (integer, DateTime, Timedelta) and checks the type of the key for each case, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
