Analysis:
The buggy function `_convert_key` is a part of the `_AtIndexer` class. The GitHub issue mentioned is related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case. This indicates that the bug might be related to the conversion of keys in the `convert_key` function.

Potential error location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check for the type of index and the type of the key.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the types of index and the key. The function may not be properly checking for integer and non-integer indexers, which is causing issues with Series lookups for Float64Index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add proper checks for the type of index and the key.
2. Ensure that the function handles integer and non-integer indexers appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
The corrected code includes proper checks for the type of index and the key, and it ensures that integer and non-integer indexers are handled appropriately. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.
