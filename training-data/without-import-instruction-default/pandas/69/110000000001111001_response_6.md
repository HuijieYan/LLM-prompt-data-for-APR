Potential error: The function is checking if the index and key are both integers or both non-integers, but it is not correctly handling the case where the index and key have different types (e.g., one is a float and the other is an integer).

Bug's cause: The function is not properly handling the case where the index and key have different types, leading to errors in cases where the types do not match.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the types of the index and key separately, and handle cases where they have different types.
2. Use the `dtype` attribute of the pandas Index objects to check their types and compare them with the type of the key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, float) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks the type of the key compared to the type of the index and raises an error if they are mismatched. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
