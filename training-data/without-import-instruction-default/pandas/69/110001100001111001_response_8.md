The buggy function is supposed to convert the input key into the same type as the index. It loops through the axes of the object and checks if the type of the index matches with the type of the key. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation.

The main issue is with the variable `i` - it appears that the function is expecting `i` to be a float or an integer, but `i` is actually a tuple element and needs to be extracted from the tuple.

Additionally, the comparison `ax.is_integer()` and `is_integer(i)` are not defined, and the correct methods to determine if a value is an integer or not are not being used.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code to correctly extract the element from the tuple and use the appropriate method to determine if the value is an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have float indexers")
        else:
            if isinstance(i, float) and not isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-float indexers")
    return key
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the conversion of keys and should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
