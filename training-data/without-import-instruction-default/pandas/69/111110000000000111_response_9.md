1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The GitHub issue title suggests that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, which indicates that there are issues related to accessing values in the index. The function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting keys to be the same type as the index, so it is likely related to the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for checking whether the index and the key have the same type.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to how the function handles conversions of keys and checks for matching types between the index and the key. This is important for accurately retrieving values from the index, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. 

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the key and index have the same type before attempting to access values.
   - Reviewing the logic for handling different types of indexes and keys to ensure consistency and accuracy.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

This corrected code includes checks to ensure that the key matches the type of the index before accessing values, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
