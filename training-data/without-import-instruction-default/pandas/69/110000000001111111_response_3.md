The issue arises from the `_convert_key` function not handling the case where the input key is a float, while the index is a `Float64Index`. This causes the function to incorrectly raise a ValueError in some cases.

The potential error location within the function is the check for `is_integer` and `holds_integer` for the index and key values.

The bug is caused by the function not properly handling the scenario where the key value is a float and the index is a `Float64Index`. This causes the function to raise a ValueError incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to check if the index is a `Float64Index` and handle the key value accordingly. It should not raise a ValueError if the key is a float and the index is a `Float64Index`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```
