1. The buggy function is a method called `_convert_key` within the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function is used to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index, either for arbitrary setting or for checking whether the index is integer based or not.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it iterates through the axes of the object and checks the type of the index.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly checking the type of the index without properly handling the case when the index is not an integer index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Adding proper handling for cases when the index is not an integer index.
   b. Implementing checks for the type of the index in a more robust and efficient way.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we have used the `isinstance()` function to check the type of the index, and we have also added proper error messages for the different cases. This should ensure that the function handles the different types of indexes correctly and prevents the buggy behavior.
