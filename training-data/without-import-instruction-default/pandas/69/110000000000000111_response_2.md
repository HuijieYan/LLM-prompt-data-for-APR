1. The buggy function is meant to convert a key, ensuring that it matches the type of the index. The GitHub issue is related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case, indicating a potential issue with key conversion.

2. The potential error location within the function could be the handling of non-integer indexes and indexers, especially for the Float64Index case.

3. The bug is likely caused by the function not properly handling non-integer indexers for the Float64Index case, leading to incorrect series lookups. This is apparent from the GitHub issue specifically mentioning the Float64Index case being affected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding specific handling for the Float64Index case in the function, ensuring that non-integer indexers are properly handled.
   - Checking the data type of the index and implementing appropriate type checks for the key to ensure compatibility.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds specific handling for the Float64Index case, ensuring that only float indexers are allowed. Additionally, it checks for integer and non-integer indexers based on the index type, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
