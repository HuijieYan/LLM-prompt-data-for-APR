The bug in the `_convert_key` function seems to be caused by the comparison of different types of index and key values. The function should be modified to handle integer and non-integer index values appropriately.

Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it compares the index values with the key values.

Bug's cause:
The bug's cause is likely due to the assumption that the index and key values are of the same type, leading to incorrect comparisons and error messages.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and key values before comparing them.
2. Handle integer and non-integer index values separately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        if isinstance(key, (int, float)):
            return [key]
        else:
            return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, float)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should now handle the different types of index and key values appropriately, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
