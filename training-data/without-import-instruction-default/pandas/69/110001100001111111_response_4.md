The issue seems to be related to the handling of index types in the _convert_key function. The function is supposed to check if the keys are the same type as the index and raise a ValueError if they are not. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling cases where the index is a Float64Index or a TimedeltaIndex.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of index types and the lack of proper validation for non-integer indexes. This results in unexpected behavior when using the function with non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key function needs to properly handle Float64Index and TimedeltaIndex and validate the keys against the index type. Additionally, the function should raise a ValueError for non-integer indexers when the index is not an integer index.

One approach to fixing the bug is to check the type of the index and validate the keys accordingly. For Float64Index and TimedeltaIndex, the keys should be checked for floating-point numbers and integers respectively. If the keys do not match the index type, a ValueError should be raised. Additionally, the function should also check for non-integer indexers when the index is not an integer index and raise a ValueError accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers")
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code properly handles different index types and validates the keys against the index type, raising a ValueError when there is a mismatch. This approach should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
