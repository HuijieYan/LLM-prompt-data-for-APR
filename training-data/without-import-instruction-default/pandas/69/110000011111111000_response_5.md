The issue with the `_convert_key` function is that it incorrectly checks for integer indexes and indexers. The function needs to handle different types of indexes and indexers correctly, without restricting them to only integers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating():
            if not is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a floating index can only have floating indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_float(i) and not ax.holds_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-floating index can only have non-floating indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected version:
- The method `ax.is_integer()` is replaced with `ax.is_floating()` and `is_integer(i)` is replaced with `is_float(i)`.
- If the index is a floating type (`ax.is_floating()`), the corresponding indexer is required to be a float, and if the index is a non-floating type, the corresponding indexer is expected to be non-floating.

This should resolve the issues described in the failing test cases by accommodating different types of indexes and indexers.
