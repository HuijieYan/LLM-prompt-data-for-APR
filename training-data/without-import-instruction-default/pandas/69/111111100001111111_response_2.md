The problematic function `_convert_key` appears to be used in the context of indexing operations on a Series object. The function is meant to ensure that the keys used for indexing are of the same type as the index itself. However, the function is not correctly handling cases where the index is of type `datetime64[ns]` or `timedelta64[ns]`.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" highlights that the Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the behavior observed in the failing tests.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the type checking and validation logic for the index and the keys that are being passed.

The bug's cause can be elucidated by looking at the discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable values. In all failing cases provided, the function is not correctly handling the type checking and validation logic when the index is of type `datetime64[ns]` or `timedelta64[ns]`.

To fix the bug, we should update the type checking logic in the `_convert_key` function to properly handle cases where the index is of type `datetime64[ns]` or `timedelta64[ns]`. Additionally, the validation logic for the keys should be adjusted to account for different index types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime/timedelta index "
                    "can only have datetime/timedelta indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With the corrected code, the function now properly handles different types of index (including `datetime64[ns]` and `timedelta64[ns]`) and performs the necessary type checking and validation for the keys, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
