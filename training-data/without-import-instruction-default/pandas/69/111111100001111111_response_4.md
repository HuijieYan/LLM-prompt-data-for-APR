Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function can be identified in the loop where it checks the type of the index. The function is intended to check whether the index is an integer or not and handle the input accordingly. However, there are inconsistencies in handling the input type and value.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of input types in the loop. The function fails to correctly identify whether the input is an integer or non-integer, leading to incorrect behavior when checking the index type.

Suggested Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the loop to correctly identify the type of the index and handle input values accordingly.
2. Use the appropriate methods to check if the index is an integer or non-integer.
3. Ensure that the function returns the correct output based on the input type and value.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code includes modifications to the loop to correctly identify the type of the index and handle input values accordingly. The function now checks if the index is a DateTimeIndex or a TimedeltaIndex, and handles the input based on the index type. This corrected code should address the issues mentioned in the GitHub bug report and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
