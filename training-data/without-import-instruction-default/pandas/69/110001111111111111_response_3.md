The issue is caused by the `_convert_key` function not handling cases with float and integer keys properly.

Based on the failing test and error messages, the problem lies in the `_convert_key` function, which is not handling the cases of float and integer keys correctly. The function should be able to differentiate between the two types and handle them appropriately.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_convert_key` function to handle float and integer keys separately.
2. For float keys, check if the corresponding index axis holds float values, and for integer keys, check if the index axis holds integer values. Raise ValueError if there's a mismatch in types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, float) and not ax.is_floating():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-float index "
                "can only have non-float indexers"
            )
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function can handle both float and integer keys correctly, and it should pass the failing test while also resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
