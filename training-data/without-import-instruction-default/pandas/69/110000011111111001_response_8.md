The bug in the `_convert_key` function is in the check for whether an index is an integer or not. It's not handling the float index correctly. The check to see if the index is an integer is incorrect. The function should be updated to check for an integer type rather than using a function `is_integer()` that does not exist.

The updated code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, (pd.Index, pd.RangeIndex)) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

By updating the function to check the index type using `isinstance` and handling the cases of `float` and `int` separately, the function will be able to correctly validate the keys. This updated code should fix the bug and fulfill the requirements.
