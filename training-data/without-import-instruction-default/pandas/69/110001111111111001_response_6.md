The issue with the buggy function `_convert_key` seems to be the way it handles integer and non-integer indexers. The function seems to be incorrectly checking for integer types and not handling floats properly, which leads to the test failures reported.

A potential cause of the bug is that the function does not handle float indexes properly, leading to the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle both integer and float indexers and not raise a ValueError when the input is a float value as it correctly represents the index value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle both integer and float indexers, and not raise a ValueError when the input is a float value. This fix should make the function work as expected and pass the failing test cases provided.
