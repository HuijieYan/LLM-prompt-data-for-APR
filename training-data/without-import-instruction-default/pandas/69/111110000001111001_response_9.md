The issue with the _convert_key function is that it's not correctly handling the conversion of the key values. It's currently checking for the type of the index and the key, but it should be checking for the type of the index and the key's elements individually, as they could be of different types.

To fix this, we can modify the function to iterate through the key elements and compare their types with the index types.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle the key elements with different types correctly and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
