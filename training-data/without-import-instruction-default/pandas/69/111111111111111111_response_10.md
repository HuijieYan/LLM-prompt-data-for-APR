The potential error in the problematic function `_convert_key` is the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes. The function is not handling float and integer index values correctly, leading to a ValueError being raised when it shouldn't.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the different types of index values, leading to incorrect validation and ValueErrors being raised during the tests.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes needs to be revised to handle float and integer index values appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (Float64Index, Int64Index)) and not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on an {type(ax).__name__} index can only have {type(ax._inttype).__name__} indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(ax, (Float64Index, Int64Index)) and isinstance(i, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on a non-{type(ax).__name__} index can only have non-{type(ax._inttype).__name__} indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code will properly handle integer and float index values for both integer and non-integer types of indexes. It should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
