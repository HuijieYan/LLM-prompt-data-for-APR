The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert the input key based on certain conditions. It checks if the key values are of the same type as the index values and raises a ValueError if they are not. The bug occurs in the section of code where it checks for integer types in the index values.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle cases where the index values are of type float or timedelta, leading to a ValueError being incorrectly raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle float and timedelta index values separately and perform the necessary checks for the key values against the index values.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code now handles the different types of index values (float, timedelta, integer) and checks the key values against them accordingly, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
