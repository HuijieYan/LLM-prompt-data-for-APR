1. The buggy function _convert_key is a method within the _AtIndexer class. This method is responsible for converting the key based on certain conditions and returning the updated key.

2. The potential error is in the for loop where it checks the type of the index and raises a ValueError if the conditions are not met.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the condition checks within the for loop are not correctly validating the type of the index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly checking the type of the index and updating the condition checks in the for loop
   - Adding appropriate error handling for different scenarios
   - Debugging and testing with different input scenarios to ensure the method works as intended

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the for loop checks the type of the index using the isinstance method and raises a ValueError if the conditions are not met. The conditions have been updated to properly validate the type of the index and ensure that it aligns with the index type.
