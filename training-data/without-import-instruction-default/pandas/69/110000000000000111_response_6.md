1. The buggy function is a method for converting keys in a pandas DataFrame or Series. It seems to be related to indexing and handling different types of keys, such as integer or non-integer. The GitHub issue title suggests that the bug affects the `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value` methods, which are related to indexing and getting values from Series.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely in the loop that iterates through the axes and compares the type of the index with the type of the key. 

3. The bug in the function could be causing issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case. The function is likely not handling the different types of indexes and keys correctly, leading to incorrect lookups and values being returned.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Ensuring that the function correctly handles cases where the index and keys are of different types.
   - Implementing proper error handling and type checking to avoid the issues mentioned in the GitHub report.
   - Reviewing the logic of the function to ensure that it accurately handles different index types and key types.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(ax, (pd.Float64Index, pd.RangeIndex)):
                if not isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, (str, bool)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Index type not supported"
                    )
    return key
```

This corrected function includes proper type checking for different index types and keys. It also implements appropriate error handling based on the type of the index. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to Series lookups for the Float64Index case.
