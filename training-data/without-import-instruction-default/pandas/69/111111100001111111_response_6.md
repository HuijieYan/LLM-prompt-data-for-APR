The buggy function "_convert_key" is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index. The issue arises when the function checks if the index is an integer and then compares it with the key. This comparison can cause errors when the types of the index and the key don't match, leading to incorrect behavior.

The bug's cause arises from the incorrect comparison of the index type with the key type. This comparison is not necessary for the function to accomplish its primary goal of converting the key to the same type as the index. Additionally, the discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values further confirms the presence of the bug, as the function is not handling the cases where the input types do not match the index types.

To fix the bug, we can remove the unnecessary comparison between index types and key types and instead focus on converting the key to the same type as the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        index_type = type(self.obj.index[0])
        return tuple(map(index_type, key))
```

The corrected code removes the unnecessary comparisons and focuses solely on converting the key to the same type as the index. This should resolve the issue and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should also address the problem mentioned in the GitHub issue related to the Series lookup being affected for the Float64Index case.
