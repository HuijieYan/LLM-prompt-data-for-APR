The bug in the code is that it does not handle cases where the index is not an integer type, but the key provided is an integer. This causes the function to raise a ValueError incorrectly in some cases.

To fix the bug, we should check if the index is an integer or not, and then check if the key is an integer in the corresponding index. If there is a mismatch, we should raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now handle cases where the index and keys are of different types, as well as satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
