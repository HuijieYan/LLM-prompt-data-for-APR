The buggy function is checking if the index is an integer, but it's not correctly identifying the type of the index, which leads to incorrect behavior. Additionally, there is inconsistency in type checking and comparison throughout the function.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the way we check the type of the index and the type of the elements in the key. We need to make sure that the comparison between types is consistent and accurate.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, (pd.TimedeltaIndex, pd.DatetimeIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, pd.Timestamp)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta or datetime index "
                    "can only have timedelta or datetime indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid index type")
    return key
```
