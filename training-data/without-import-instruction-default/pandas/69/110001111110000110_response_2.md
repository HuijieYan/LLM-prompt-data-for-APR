```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have non-integer indexers")
        elif not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-Float64Index index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key

```
In the fixed version of the function, we added checks to ensure that the index type and indexer type match, throwing an error if they don't. This should address the bug and prevent the failing test scenarios.
