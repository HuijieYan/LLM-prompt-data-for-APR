The buggy function `_convert_key` is intended to require that the keys are the same type as the index it is being applied to. However, there are discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values when the function is called, which leads to the failing test and error message.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop that iterates through the axes and keys. The conditions within the loop are not handling the cases where the index is of type `datetime64` or `timedelta64` correctly, which is causing the ValueError to be raised.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the cases where the index is of type `datetime64` or `timedelta64` correctly. As a result, when the function is called with these types of indexes, it raises a ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle `datetime64` and `timedelta64` types specifically and allow for the correct comparison of keys and index types in these cases. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index "
                    "can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-datetime or non-timedelta "
                    "index can only have non-datetime or non-timedelta "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should now handle cases where the index is of type `datetime64` or `timedelta64` correctly, ensuring that the comparisons between the keys and the index types are accurate. This will resolve the failing test and the GitHub issue.
