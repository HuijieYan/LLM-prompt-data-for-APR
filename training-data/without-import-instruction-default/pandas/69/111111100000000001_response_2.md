1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is a child class of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. This function is used to convert the key to the same type as the index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if `ax` is an integer.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to incorrect logic in the conditional statements. This logic is used to determine if the indexer is of the correct type based on the axis.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and correct the logic in the conditional statements to properly check if the indexer is of the correct type based on the axis.
   - Add error handling to appropriately handle cases where the indexer does not match the type of the axis.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):




    # this is the corrected function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() or isinstance(i, int):
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
