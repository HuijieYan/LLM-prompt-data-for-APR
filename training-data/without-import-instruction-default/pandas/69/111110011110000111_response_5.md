The problematic function is `_convert_key` in the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is used for converting keys to a suitable format based on the index type.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is trying to access values based on non-integer indexes, and it's failing with a `ValueError` stating that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The GitHub issue describes this as "corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" and mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location is within the loop in the `_convert_key` function where it checks if the index is integer or non-integer.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function now properly handles integer and non-integer indexes, which should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
