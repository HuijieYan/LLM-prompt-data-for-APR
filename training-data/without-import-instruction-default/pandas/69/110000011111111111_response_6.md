The buggy function `_convert_key` is throwing a `ValueError` when it encounters non-integer indexes, which is causing the failing test cases. The function is meant to check if the keys are the same type as the index, and allow arbitrary setting if `is_setter` is True. However, the implementation is incorrect and does not handle all the cases properly.

The actual problem lies in the if-else condition inside the for loop, where it checks if the index is an integer. This check is incorrect and is raising a ValueError when it encounters non-integer indexes.

To fix this issue, we can modify the implementation of the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle both integer and non-integer indexes.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fall back)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In this corrected version, we use `isinstance` to check if the index is an instance of `pd.Int64Index` and if the key is of type `int`, raising a `ValueError` in the appropriate case.

This corrected version should now properly handle both integer and non-integer indexes, and pass all the failing test cases.
