The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class and is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index. It seems to be causing issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that iterates through the axes and compares the type of the index with the type of the key. This is where the function may be incorrectly handling different types of indices and keys.

The bug's cause is likely due to the function not handling different types of indices and keys properly, leading to incorrect behavior and Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to handle different types of indices and keys correctly. This might involve checking the type of the index and key before comparing them, and handling conversions or validations as necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a float index "
                        "can only have float indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(ax, TimedeltaIndex):
                if not isinstance(i, timedelta):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a timedelta index "
                        "can only have timedelta indexers"
                    )
            else:
                # Handle other types of indices here
                pass
        
        return key
```

This corrected code should handle different types of indices and keys properly, ensuring that the key is converted to the same type as the index. This should resolve the issue with Series lookups and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
