The issue is likely occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function is used to convert the key used for indexing into the appropriate format based on the type of the index.

The failing test is related to lookups on `Float64Index` and `DatetimeIndex` objects. The failing tests are not returning the expected values when accessing the Series using 4 as an index.

The failing test is raising a `ValueError` stating that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This indicates that the issue lies within the type checking logic inside the `_convert_key` function.

It's clear that the current type checking logic inside the `_convert_key` function is causing the issue, as it is not handling the cases for `Float64Index` and `DatetimeIndex` appropriately.

To fix this, the type checking logic inside the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to handle cases related to `Float64Index` and `DatetimeIndex`. Specifically, the type checking logic based on `ax.is_integer()` and `is_integer(i)` needs to be modified to handle different types of indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.datetime64) and not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.timedelta64):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index can only have datetime or timedelta indexers")

    return key
```

This updated logic includes additional checks for different types of indexes (`Float64Index`, `DatetimeIndex`, and `TimedeltaIndex`), ensuring that the type of the indexer matches the type of the index.

These changes should address the failing tests and ensure that the `_convert_key` function handles different index types correctly.

This fix should also resolve the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value".
