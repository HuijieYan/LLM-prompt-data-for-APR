1. The buggy function _convert_key is part of the _AtIndexer class, which is a subclass of _ScalarAccessIndexer. This function is responsible for converting a given key to a valid format for indexing.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that iterates through the axes and keys, where it checks for integer and non-integer values.

3. (a). The buggy function _convert_key takes a key and a boolean is_setter parameter. It then iterates through the axes and checks if the key is of the same type as the index.
   (b). The buggy class _AtIndexer seems to be related to indexing operations and likely interacts with other indexing-related functions in the pandas library.
   (c). The related functions might include other indexing methods and classes within the pandas library that deal with similar operations.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for checking the type of keys against the index and ensure it handles different cases correctly.
   - Check if the comparison of index type and key type is accurate and handle the cases where they don't match appropriately.
   - Ensure that the function covers all edge cases and provides informative error messages.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):  # Check if the axis is integer and key is not an integer
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):  # Check if the axis is not an integer and key is an integer
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the logic for checking the type of keys against the index is revised to handle different cases correctly. It checks if the axis is integer and the key is not an integer, and vice versa, before raising appropriate ValueErrors. This ensures that the function covers all edge cases and provides informative error messages.
