The issue here seems to be related to the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The error message indicates that there is an issue with non-integer indexing, specifically when using Float64Index. This causes a ValueError to be raised when the test cases are run. 

The problem seems to be in the conditional check for non-integer indexing. It's currently comparing the index type to the type of the indexers, which might not be correct. Instead, the comparison should be based on the type of the indexers and not the type of the index itself.

To fix this issue, the conditional checks in the `_convert_key` function need to be corrected to properly handle non-integer indexers. The comparisons should also take into account the type of the indexers, rather than just the type of the index itself.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With these changes, the conditional checks are now comparing the type of the indexers with the type of the axis, and raising a ValueError if there is a mismatch. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test cases pass.

This corrected code should now satisfy the failing test cases and the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
