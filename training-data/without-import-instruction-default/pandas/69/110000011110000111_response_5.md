The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for raising a `ValueError` when the index is non-integer and the keys used for indexing are integer. This is identified as the cause of the failing test, which is trying to index using a non-integer key on a float64 index.

The failing test is attempting to use the `at` method to index a Series, and the error message indicates that the issue lies in the `_convert_key` function of the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The error message explicitly states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

The test is failing due to the restriction imposed by the `_convert_key` function with respect to using integer indexers on non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, the restriction for using integer indexers on non-integer indexes needs to be removed from the `_convert_key` function. A potential approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to allow integer indexers on non-integer indexes.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        # Removed the restriction for non-integer indexes
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the restriction on using non-integer indexes with integer keys has been removed. This should allow the failing test to pass and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.

By resolving this bug, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be positively addressed.
