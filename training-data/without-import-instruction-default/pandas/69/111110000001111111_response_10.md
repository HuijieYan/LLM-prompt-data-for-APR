The potential error location within the problematic function is the `is_integer()` method being called on `ax` and `i`. This method is likely not working as intended, leading to the ValueError being raised incorrectly.

The bug is likely caused by the `is_integer()` method not correctly identifying whether a value is an integer or not, leading to the incorrect ValueError being raised. This causes the Series lookups to be affected for the Float64Index case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `is_integer()` method correctly to accurately identify whether a value is an integer or not.
2. Check the type of the values using Python's built-in `isinstance()` function to determine if they are integers.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) != isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Float64Index):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        if isinstance(i, float) != isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Float64Index):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code uses `isinstance()` to check the type of the values and the index, allowing it to accurately determine whether a value is an integer or not. This should fix the bug and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
