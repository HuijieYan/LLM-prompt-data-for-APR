1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer` which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. This function is used to convert keys to match the type of the index. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition for checking if the axis is integer.

3. (a) The buggy function is trying to handle the conversion of keys to match the type of the index, but the logic for checking whether the axis is integer or not is flawed.
   (b) The buggy class `_AtIndexer` is responsible for providing indexing functionality and seems to be using the `_convert_key` function for handling key conversion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic for checking whether the axis is integer or not.
   - Ensure that the function handles both cases of integer and non-integer indexes correctly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
