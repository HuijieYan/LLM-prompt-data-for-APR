1. The buggy function is related to the issue reported on GitHub, which mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case. The function is responsible for converting the key into a specific format based on the index type and checking for certain conditions. It is likely that the bug in this function is causing issues with lookups in the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statements that check for the type of the index and the type of the key.

3. The bug is likely causing incorrect validation of the key based on the index type, leading to issues with lookups in the Float64Index case. This aligns with the GitHub issue mentioning that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the validation of the key based on the index type, leading to lookup issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the conditional statements in the function to ensure that the validation of the key is accurately based on the index type.
   - Ensuring that the function correctly handles the Float64Index case and does not cause issues with Series lookups.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        if not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```

This corrected code addresses the issues by properly validating the key based on the index type, ensuring that lookups will not be affected in the Float64Index case.
