1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index. It checks whether the index is an integer index or non-integer index, and based on that, it raises a ValueError if the key does not match the index type. The buggy function is part of the IndexingMixin class in the pandas library and is related to indexing operations on Series and DataFrame.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it checks if the index is integer or non-integer and compares it with the key. It may not handle the cases where the key type and index type do not match correctly.

3. The bug's cause may be due to the implementation of the logic for checking the type of the index and comparing it with the key in the for loop. The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is due to the buggy function not correctly handling the cases where the key type and index type do not match. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the issues observed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the logic in the for loop to correctly handle cases where the key type and index type do not match.
   - Ensure that the function can handle different index types and key types appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer " 
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected function includes updated logic to correctly handle the cases where the key type and index type do not match. It includes the appropriate type checking using the `pd.api.types.is_integer` method to compare the key type and index type. This should address the issues observed and align with the GitHub issue posted.
