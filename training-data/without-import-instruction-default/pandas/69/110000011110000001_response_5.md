The buggy function `_convert_key` is being used in the failing test to perform data conversion and validation for indexing purposes. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` being raised from the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the block of code where it checks for integer indexers.

The bug in the `_convert_key` function is caused by the incorrect implementation of type checking for indexers. The function is not properly handling non-integer indexers when the axis is non-integer. This leads to the `ValueError` being raised in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the type checking for indexers based on the axis type should be updated to properly handle non-integer indexers when the axis is also non-integer. Additionally, the handling of setting arbitrary keys should be reviewed and correctly implemented.

Below is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):  # Use isinstance for type checking
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):  # Check for non-integer indexers
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

By updating the type checking logic in the `_convert_key` function, it now correctly handles both integer and non-integer indexers based on the axis type, resolving the issue observed in the failing test.
