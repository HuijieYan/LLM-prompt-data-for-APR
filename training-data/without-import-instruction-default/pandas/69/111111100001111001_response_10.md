Potential error location: The if statement checking if ax is an integer and i is not, and the else statement checking if i is an integer and ax does not hold integer values seems incorrect.

Bug's cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect logic in the if and else statements. The code is not effectively checking if the index and the key have matching types and is unnecessarily checking for integer values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the key and the index have matching types.
2. Remove unnecessary checks for integer values.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if type(ax) != type(i):
            raise ValueError("Key type does not match index type")

    return key
```
