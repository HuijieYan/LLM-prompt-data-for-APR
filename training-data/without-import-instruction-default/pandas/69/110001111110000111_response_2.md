The buggy function _convert_key is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. It checks if the key is an integer and raises a ValueError if it is not matching the type of the index.

The failing test is testing the lookups for datetime64 or timedelta64 values in a Series with a Float64Index. The error message indicates that the ValueError is being raised when using the at method with a non-integer index.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are corner cases in the get_value method for DateTimeIndex and Float64Index, and the Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix this bug, the _convert_key function needs to be updated to handle the case of a Float64Index with non-integer keys.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds a check for a Float64Index and raises a ValueError if the key is not an integer. This change should resolve the issue with Series lookups for a Float64Index in the failing test and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
