1. The buggy function is used to convert keys and check for validity in a pandas DataFrame. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that there are issues with Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the validation checks for integer and non-integer indexes.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the validation checks within the _convert_key function. The function checks if the index is an integer and then checks if the key is also an integer. If the index is not an integer, it checks if the key is not an integer. However, there may be a flaw in the logic of these checks, leading to incorrect behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Re-evaluating the logic for validating keys and indexes to ensure that it covers all edge cases and accurately determines the validity of keys.
   - Reviewing the specific behavior of Float64Index to understand how it may be different from other index types and adjusting the validation checks accordingly.
   - Adding additional error handling to capture any unexpected cases.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the isinstance function is used to check if 'i' is an instance of the int class instead of the is_integer function. This should help to accurately validate the type of the key based on the index type, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
