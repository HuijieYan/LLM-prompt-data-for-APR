The problem in the function is with the loop that iterates over the axes and keys. The loop is checking whether the axis is integer and then compares it with the key to ensure that they are of the same type. However, the comparison logic is incorrect. 

The bug is likely causing incorrect value type comparisons, leading to unexpected behavior for certain input types, such as integer and float. This is supported by the GitHub issue title that mentions "corner cases".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the loop logic to correctly compare the axis type with the key type. Additionally, we should handle the case where the key is a tuple and convert it into a list.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    key_list = list(key)  # convert key tuple to a list
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key_list):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key_list
```

This corrected code should resolve the issues mentioned in the GitHub issue and also satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
