The problematic function is `_convert_key` within the `_AtIndexer` class, and the error is being triggered by the `raise ValueError` statement inside the `else` block. The error message indicates that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" is being raised, which suggests that the function is not handling non-integer indexes properly.

The potential cause of the bug is that the function is not effectively differentiating between integer and non-integer indexes, leading to the ValueError being incorrectly raised.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to better handle integer and non-integer indexes. We can do this by checking the type of the index and key to ensure that they match appropriately.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should now properly handle both integer and non-integer indexes, and should pass the failing test.
