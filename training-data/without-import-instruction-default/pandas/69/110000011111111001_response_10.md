The failing test is related to the function `_convert_key` which is used to convert the key to the same type as the index. The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexing properly.

The potential error in the function `_convert_key` is in the logic for checking whether the key is an integer and whether the axis holds an integer. It seems like the function is not properly handling non-integer cases.

The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling cases where the key is non-integer or where the axis does not hold an integer.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling non-integer cases in the `_convert_key` function and ensure that it properly handles non-integer indexing.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't
    fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (float, int)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check for non-integer cases and raise a ValueError accordingly. This revised function should now handle both integer and non-integer cases correctly, and it should pass the failing test.
