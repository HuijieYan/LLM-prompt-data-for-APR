The bug is caused by incorrect type checking in the `_convert_key` function, where it fails to handle float and integer types correctly, resulting in a ValueError when the `ser.at` method is called in the test due to a non-integer index being passed as an integer indexer. The function incorrectly handles type checking for float and integer values.

To fix the bug, the type checking logic in the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to correctly handle float and integer types. Additionally, the function should also handle the case where the index is of datetime/timedelta type, and ensure that the key passed to it matches the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexing.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index, and handle float and integer indexers correctly.
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        ax = self.obj.axes[0]

        if isinstance(ax, (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(key, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                key = ax._format_native_types(key)
        else:
            if not ax.is_type_compatible([key]):
                raise ValueError(f"At based indexing on a {ax.dtype} index can only have {ax.dtype} indexers")
        
        return key
```

With the corrected code, the `_convert_key` function should now handle float and integer types correctly, and also ensure that the key matches the type of the index. This should resolve the ValueError that was being raised in the failing test.

The corrected function should now properly handle the cases outlined in the failing test, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
