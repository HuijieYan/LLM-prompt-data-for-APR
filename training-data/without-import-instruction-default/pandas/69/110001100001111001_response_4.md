The bug in the function lies in the comparison of types. The function is attempting to compare the type of the index with the type of the key, but it is not doing so correctly. Specifically, the function is looking for the type of the index to be integer or non-integer, which is not a valid comparison for the type of the index.

To fix this bug, the function can be modified to check if the type of the index matches the type of the key instead. This can be done using the isinstance() function to check for the type of the index.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, type(ax[0])):
            continue
        else:
            raise ValueError("Keys must have the same type as the index")

    return key
```
