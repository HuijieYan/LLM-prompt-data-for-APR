Potential error location:
The potential error in the function is in the `for` loop where it checks if the index is an integer.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect check for whether the index is an integer or not. The function `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` are not defined within the context of the function, which would cause a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the index is an integer using the `isinstance()` function.
2. Use the `dtype` attribute of the index to determine if it is an integer index.

Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` functions are replaced with `isinstance()` checks using the `pd.Int64Index` and `np.integer` to determine the type of the index and the key. This will fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
