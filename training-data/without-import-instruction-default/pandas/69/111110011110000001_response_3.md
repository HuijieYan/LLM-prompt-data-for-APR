The buggy function is `_convert_key` within the class `_AtIndexer`. This function is responsible for converting the key into a certain format based on the input parameters.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` considers datetime or timedelta values and is attempting to assert multiple comparisons using the `ser.at` method. The error message indicates that the function raises a ValueError due to indexing on a non-integer index with non-integer indexers.

The bug seems to be caused by the mismatch in the expected behavior of the `_AtIndexer` class and the actual implementation of the `_convert_key` function.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to handle datetime or timedelta-like values correctly. It should only raise a ValueError if the dtypes of the index and the key do not match.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    index_dtype = self.obj.index.dtype
    key_dtype = np.array(key).dtype
    if index_dtype != key_dtype:
        raise ValueError("Keys must be of the same type as the index")

    return key
```

This updated implementation checks if the dtype of the index matches the dtype of the key. If they do not match, it raises a ValueError with an appropriate error message. This implementation should pass the failing test case and ensure that the `ser.at` method behaves as expected for datetime and timedelta-like indexes.
