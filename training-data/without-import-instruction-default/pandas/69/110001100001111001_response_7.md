The bug appears to be caused by the logic in the if-else statements within the for loop. It is checking if the index is an integer using the `is_integer()` method, and then the value is an integer using the `is_integer()` function, but the correct method to check if a value is an integer is `isinstance(i, int)`. There is also a typo in the error message "At based" should be "Int based" and the second error message should be "On a non-integer index".

To fix the bug, we should replace the `is_integer()` function with `isinstance(i, int)` and update the error messages.
Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "Int based indexing on an non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, float) and ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "Int based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for cases 1 and 2.
