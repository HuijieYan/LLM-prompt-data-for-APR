The potential error location within the problematic function is at the for loop where it is comparing the types of the index with the types of the keys.

The bug's cause is that the function is not properly handling the comparison between integer and non-integer indexes with integer and non-integer keys.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and the type of the keys separately and handle each case individually.
2. Use the `isinstance()` function to check the type of the keys and index and handle the comparisons accordingly.
3. Handle the cases for both integer and non-integer indexes and keys separately.

```python
# The corrected code for the buggy function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, np.int64):  # Check for both int and np.int64
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, np.int64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function now handles the cases for both integer and non-integer indexes with integer and non-integer keys separately, as well as the cases where the keys and indexes are of the same type. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
