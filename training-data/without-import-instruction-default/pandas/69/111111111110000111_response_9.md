The problematic function `_convert_key` is responsible for handling the keys to be the same type as the index, but it is not doing so correctly. The function is iterating through the axes of the object and checking if the index is integer type or not. However, the issue is occurring when the index is non-integer and the function is trying to raise a `ValueError`.

The cause of the bug is that the implementation of the function does not handle non-integer indexes correctly and raises a `ValueError` when it encounters non-integer indexes.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to properly handle non-integer indexes. It should check if the index is non-integer and handle it accordingly, without raising a `ValueError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified function properly handles different types of indexes and returns the key without raising any `ValueError`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.

By using the corrected function, the failing tests should pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
