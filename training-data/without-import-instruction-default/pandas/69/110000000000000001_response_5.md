1. The buggy function is a method designed to convert keys to the same type as the index, with an option to set the keys. However, it contains several errors such as incorrect function calls, missing imports, and incorrect variable usage.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function are the misuse of the is_integer function and is_integer variable, as well as the incorrect usage of the holds_integer function.

3. The bug's cause is the incorrect usage of functions such as is_integer and holds_integer, which are not defined within the function, leading to a NameError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Importing the required functions (if they are external) or defining them within the function.
   - Properly using the function calls and variables.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't
    fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, int):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer-based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer-based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
Note: This correction assumes that the function isinstance() is being used to check for the type of ax and i, and replaces the incorrect uses of is_integer and holds_integer with the correct function calls.
