1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is being used in the failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` to convert the key before indexing. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised in the `_convert_key` function when using the `ser.at[4]` method in the test code.

2. The potential error location seems to be in the `_convert_key` function, where it checks for the type of index and key and raises a ValueError if they don't match.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not handling the indexing correctly for non-integer indexes, leading to a ValueError being raised when using the `ser.at[4]` method.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include updating the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes and keys, ensuring that the indexing works as expected for all types of indexes.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_bool(i) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i) and not pd.api.types.is_complex(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on non-integer index can only have non-integer, boolean or float indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles non-integer indexes and keys properly, ensuring that the indexing works correctly. This should fix the bug and satisfy both the failing test and the issue posted on GitHub.
