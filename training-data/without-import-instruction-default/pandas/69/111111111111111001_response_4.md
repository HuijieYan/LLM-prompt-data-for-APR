The buggy function `_convert_key` is intended to require keys to be the same type as the index. It attempts to achieve this by comparing the types of the keys with the types of the index. However, the bug is caused by the fact that it doesn't handle keys of different types correctly.

The failing test is related to the `ser.at[4]` operation, which raises a `ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers` error. This suggests that the function doesn't handle non-integer keys properly, and should be able to cast integer keys to float to match the behavior of the `loc` operation.

To fix this bug, we can update the `_convert_key` function to handle different types of keys properly. It should be able to cast integer keys to float and check their compatibility with the index. If a key is an integer and the index contains floats, it should be cast to float to match the index's type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, or cast to float if necessary.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = self.obj.axes[0].dtype.type
    cast_to_float = False

    if not is_integer(key):
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
                if is_integer(i) and not index_type == np.float64:
                    cast_to_float = True

    if cast_to_float:
        key = (float(k) if is_integer(k) else k for k in key)

    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function should now handle different types of keys correctly, and the failing test should pass.
