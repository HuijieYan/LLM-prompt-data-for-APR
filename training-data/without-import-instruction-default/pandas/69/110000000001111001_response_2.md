The issue with the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the different types of index and key values. It is checking if the index is an integer, but it should check if the index is of the same type as the key.

The potential error location is in the if-else statements where it checks for the type of the index and the key.

The bug is causing the function to incorrectly handle non-integer keys when the index is an integer type, and vice versa.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the type of the index matches the type of the key, and raise a ValueError if they do not match.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if type(ax) != type(i):
            if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should now properly handle different types of keys and indexes and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
