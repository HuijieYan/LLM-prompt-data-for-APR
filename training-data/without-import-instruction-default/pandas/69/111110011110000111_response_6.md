The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer`, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The failing test is testing the behavior of the `get_value` method for the `Float64Index`. The error occurs when the `at` method is used with an integer input.

The error is caused by the `for` loop in the `_convert_key` function, which checks the type of the index and the key. It raises a `ValueError` if the types do not match.

The GitHub issue title suggests that the bug affects corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`. This provides insight into the specific scenarios that are failing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the specific case of `Float64Index` when used with the `at` method. We should check the type of the index and the type of the provided key, and handle any necessary conversions.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(self.obj, pd.Float64Index):
        key = float(key)

    return key
```

This modification checks if the index is a `Float64Index` and if so, converts the key to a float. This should address the specific issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
