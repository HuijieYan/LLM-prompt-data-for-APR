The `ValueError` is being raised in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. This function is used to convert the key to be the same type as the index.

The issue seems to be with the condition `if ax.is_integer()` which is expecting the index to be an integer, and if it's not, it is raising a `ValueError`. This condition is creating an issue with the test cases where the index is being converted to `float64` and the function is expecting an integer.

To fix this issue, the condition for checking if the index is an integer should be replaced with a condition to check if it's a floating-point number or an integer, and accordingly, handle the validation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, so we don't fallback
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_floating() and not is_float(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a floating-point index can only have floating-point indexers"
            )
        elif ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected version handles both floating-point and integer index types, and the test case should pass without raising a `ValueError`.
