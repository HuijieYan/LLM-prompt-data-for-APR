The issue is related to the handling of different index types within the `_convert_key` function, which is used for key conversion in the indexing process. The function currently checks if the index is an integer and then checks if the key is an integer, without considering the index type (i.e., whether it's a datetime index or a float index). This causes issues when the key and the index are of different types.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly account for the type of index when checking the type of key.

To fix the bug, the function needs to first check the type of the index and then ensure that the key is of the same type. This will prevent the mismatch issues that are currently occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64)):
            raise ValueError("Datetime index can only have datetime-like indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.floating):
            raise ValueError("Float index can only have float indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
            raise ValueError("Timedelta index can only have timedelta-like indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) and not np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
            raise ValueError("Integer index can only have integer indexers")

    return key
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with different index types and ensures that the key is of the same type as the index. It also provides specific error messages for each type of index, making it easier to diagnose any issues.

With this corrected code, the function should now work as expected for all provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report by properly handling different index types in series lookups.
