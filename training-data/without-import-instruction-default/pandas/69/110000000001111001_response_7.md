Potential issues/bugs:
- The first issue is that the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods do not exist for the `ax` variable, which is a Pandas `Index` object.
- The second issue is that the `is_integer()` method is being called without the correct syntax, and it should be called on the `i` variable to check if it's an integer.

Approach for fixing the bug:
- Use the `dtype` attribute of the `Index` object to check if it's an integer index.
- Use the `is_integer` method on the variable `i` to check if it's an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.dtype == 'int64':
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and ax.dtype != 'int64':
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the input and return the expected output for the provided cases.
