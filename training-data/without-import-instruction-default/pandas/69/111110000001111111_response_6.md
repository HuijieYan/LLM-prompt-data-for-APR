The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the input key into a valid key based on the type of index and whether it's a setter. The function loops through the axes and checks if the index is an integer or not. However, there are issues in the code with the checks and comparisons.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that the bug is affecting the get_value method for the DatetimeIndex and Float64Index cases. This aligns with the function's responsibility of converting the key for indexing.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison between the types of indexes and the input key values. The checks for integer types and non-integer types and comparing them with the index types are causing the function to fail.

The bug's cause is the incorrect comparison of integer types and non-integer types with the index types, leading to incorrect validations and conversions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly validate the key with the index type. Additionally, we need to handle the cases for both Float64Index and DatetimeIndex, ensuring that the comparison logic and type validations are accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError("Float64Index based indexing can only have integer or float indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError("DatetimeIndex based indexing can only have Timestamp indexers")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we first check the type of index and then validate the key type based on the index type. We handle both Float64Index and DatetimeIndex cases separately and raise appropriate errors if the validations fail.

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
