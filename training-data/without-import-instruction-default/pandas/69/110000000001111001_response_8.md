Potential error location:
The bug may be caused by the incorrect comparison of integer types in the function.

Bug's cause:
The function is incorrectly comparing the types of the index and the key. This results in misleading errors and incorrect behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and key separately before comparing them.
2. Use the appropriate methods to check for integer types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, np.int64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, np.int64) and not isinstance(i, float) and not isinstance(i, np.float64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should now satisfy all the provided test cases.
