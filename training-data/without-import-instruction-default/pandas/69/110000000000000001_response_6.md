1. The buggy function is meant to convert a key to a format that matches the index type. It checks that the key and index are of the same type and raises a ValueError if they are not.

2. The potential error location is the if-else condition inside the for loop, where it checks if the index is an integer and the axis holds an integer. 

3. The bug's cause is that the function is trying to check if `is_integer` and `holds_integer` are callable functions, but it should be checking if the axis is of type integer.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition inside the for loop to correctly check the type of the axis and the type of the index.

5. Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, int):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
