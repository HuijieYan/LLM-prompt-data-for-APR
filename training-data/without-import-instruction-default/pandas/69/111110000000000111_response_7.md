1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method within the `_AtIndexer` class which is part of the IndexingMixin module. The GitHub issue mentions a bug in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, indicating that there are issues with series lookups for Float64Index. The `_convert_key` function is likely part of the process for looking up values in the index, and it seems to be related to the reported bug.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function could be in the logic for checking the type of the index and the type of the key being passed. It seems like the function is trying to ensure that the key matches the type of the index, and if not, it raises a ValueError.

3. The bug's cause appears to be related to the validation of the key being passed to the function. If the key does not match the type of the index, a ValueError is raised. This could be causing issues with series lookups for the Float64Index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include refining the logic for checking the key's type against the index's type, ensuring that the validation process does not interfere with the series lookups, and updating the error handling to provide more specific and informative error messages.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, without falling back.
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers, but got {type(i).__name__}"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (float, str)):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers, but got {type(i).__name__}"
            )
    
    return key
```

This corrected code adds more specific error handling and checks the type of the key against the type of the index, providing informative error messages in case of mismatch. The function should now successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
