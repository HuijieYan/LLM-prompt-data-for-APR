1. The buggy function takes a key and a boolean is_setter as input and is supposed to check if the key is the same type as the index. It also checks if the key is an integer when the index is an integer and vice versa.

2. The potential error location is in the for loop where it checks the type of the key against the type of the index.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly checking the type of the key against the type of the index. It also has a syntax error in the is_integer function and does not handle the case when the index and key types do not match.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correcting the syntax error and using the correct function to check for integer type.
   - Adding a condition to handle the case when the index and key types do not match.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
            elif not isinstance(i, int) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the isinstance() function is used to check the type of the key. It also includes a condition to handle the case when the index and key types do not match.
