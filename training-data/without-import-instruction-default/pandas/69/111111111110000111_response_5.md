The problematic function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index. The issue is related to the way it handles non-integer indexes.

The failing test is attempting to use the `at` indexer with a non-integer key, causing the function to raise a ValueError. This indicates that the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer keys properly for the `at` indexer.

The issue is also reported on the GitHub issue tracker with the title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value", and the detailed description mentions that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to handle non-integer keys appropriately for the `at` indexer. Specifically, it should not raise an error when non-integer keys are used with non-integer indexes.

Here's a corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for the type of index and the type of key being used, allowing non-integer keys to be used with non-integer indexes.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved. The corrected function now handles non-integer keys appropriately for the `at` indexer, addressing the reported bug.
