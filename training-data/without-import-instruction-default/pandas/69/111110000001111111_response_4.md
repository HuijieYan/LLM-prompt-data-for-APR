The bug is caused by the _convert_key function within the _AtIndexer class. This function is responsible for converting the key into a suitable format for indexing. It checks if the key is an integer and if the axis also holds integers, and vice versa, to ensure proper indexing. However, the function does not handle the cases where the key is a float but the axis holds integers or if the key is an integer but the axis holds floats.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function to handle these cases and ensure that the key and axis are compatible for indexing.

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function handles the cases where the key is a float and the axis holds integers, or if the key is an integer and the axis holds floats. It raises a ValueError if the key and axis are not compatible for indexing, ensuring that the indexing is done properly.

This fix will address the issue posted in the GitHub report and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all the provided input cases.
