From the failing test and error message, we can identify that the bug is caused by the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The error is occurring when the function is called with the input `key` and the `is_setter` flag as `False`.

The issue seems to be related to the check for integer and non-integer keys. It is failing because the logic used to check the type of the index and the key is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to correctly validate the type of the index and the key. Additionally, the comparison of the types for integer and non-integer keys need to be adjusted based on the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be of the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                if not pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
                if not pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_any_dtype(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not pd.api.types.is_numeric(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                    )

        return key
```

This corrected code includes type-specific checks for datetime, timedelta, and numeric indexes, ensuring that the key is compatible with the index before returning it. With this fix, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
