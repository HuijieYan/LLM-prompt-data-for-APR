Potential error location: The conversion of the key to a list in the function `_convert_key` when `is_setter` is true might cause unexpected behavior.

Bug's cause:
The function `_convert_key` is responsible for ensuring that the keys are the same type as the index. The potential error lies in the logic for handling the case when `is_setter` is true, where it simply converts the key to a list without any further validation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Include additional validation checks when `is_setter` is true to ensure that the key is of the correct type.
2. Review the logic for handling `is_setter` and determine if it is necessary to convert the key to a list in that case.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # Additional check when is_setter is true
        if is_setter:
            if not isinstance(key, type(self.obj.index)):
                raise ValueError("Setter key must be of the same type as the index")
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

The corrected function includes an additional validation check when `is_setter` is true to ensure that the key is of the same type as the index. This modification addresses the potential issue identified in the GitHub issue.
