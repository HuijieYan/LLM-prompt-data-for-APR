1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" refers to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case, which indicates that the bug is related to the indexing functionality.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop where it iterates over the axes and checks for integer compatibility.

3. Analysis of the bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key input for indexing based on specific conditions.
   (b). The `_AtIndexer` class contains this function and is related to indexing operations.
   (c). The GitHub issue suggests that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which indicates that the bug may be related to improper conversion of keys for indexing.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review the logic for key conversion and compatibility checks.
   - Ensure that the conversion process is appropriate for different types of indexes, such as Float64Index.
   - Validate the key conversion process against different types of indexes to handle corner cases effectively.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.float64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index "
                    "can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an integer index {type(ax)} "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (float, np.float64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a non-integer index {type(ax)} "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks for the specific type of index and validates the key according to the index type. It also handles the Float64Index case separately to ensure proper compatibility.
