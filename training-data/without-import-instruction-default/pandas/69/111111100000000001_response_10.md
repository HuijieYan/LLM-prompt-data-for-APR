1. The buggy function _convert_key is part of the _AtIndexer class in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. It is used to convert the key into the same type as the index.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for checking if the index is integer and then comparing it with the key. 

3. The bug's cause is due to the incorrect comparison of integer index and non-integer index with the key.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly check the type of index and key for comparison
   - Use appropriate conditional statements to ensure the correct comparison between the index and key
   - Ensure that the function returns the converted key in the same type as the index

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
