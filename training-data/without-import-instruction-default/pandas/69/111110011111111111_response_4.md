Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is responsible for converting the key and ensuring that it matches the type of the index.

Bug Cause:
The `_convert_key` function is not handling the case where the index is a float and the key is an integer. Additionally, it is not handling the case where the index is a non-integer and the key is an integer.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Update the `_convert_key` function to handle the case where the index is a float and the key is an integer.
2. Add handling for the case where the index is a non-integer and the key is an integer.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should handle the cases where the index is a float and the key is an integer, as well as the cases where the index is a non-integer and the key is an integer.

By making this change, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
