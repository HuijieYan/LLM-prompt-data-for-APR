1. The buggy function _convert_key is responsible for converting the key to the appropriate format based on the index. It checks for the type of the index and the type of key being used to ensure compatibility.

2. The potential error location within the function is the conditional check for whether the index is integer or not.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the function is_integer() is not a built-in function and may lead to a NameError. Additionally, the function is_integer() is being used without being defined in the class.

4. Possible approaches to fixing the bug:
   - Define the is_integer() function within the class with the appropriate logic to check if a value is an integer.
   - Use the built-in Python function isinstance(i, int) to check if the value is an integer.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(i, int):
                if not ax.is_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer index "
                        "can only have non-integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if ax.is_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        return key
```

In the corrected code, the is_integer() function has been replaced with the Python built-in isinstance() function to check the type of the value. Additionally, the condition for checking if the index is integer or non-integer has been adjusted to match the expected behavior.
