The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for raising a `ValueError` when trying to access with '4' for `ser.at[4]` due to the check for non-integer indexers. This is resulting in the failing test.

The bug is caused by the `_convert_key` function that is not handling the case for accessing the value with an integer when the index is a float. It is erroneously raising a `ValueError` when it should be allowing this type of access.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the case of accessing a value with an integer when the index is a float, and not raise a `ValueError` in this scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers or float with no decimal"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will handle the case of accessing a value with an integer when the index is a float, and will not raise a `ValueError` erroneously. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
