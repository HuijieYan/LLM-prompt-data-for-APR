The bug in the function is that it checks if the index is an integer, but it does not check if the key is an integer. Additionally, the function compares the index to the key, but it should be comparing each element of the index to the corresponding element of the key. 

To fix the bug, the function should iterate through both the axes and the key at the same time, and for each element, it should check if the axis is an integer and if the key is an integer, or if the axis is not an integer and the key is not an integer. If these conditions are not met, it should raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes[0], key):
        if ax.is_integer() != isinstance(i, int):
            if ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            else:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the comparison between the index and the key in all the given cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
