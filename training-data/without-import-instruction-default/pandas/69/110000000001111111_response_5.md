The issue seems to be related to the type checking and comparison within the _convert_key function. The function is intended to check the type of the key and raise a ValueError if the type does not match the index. However, the function has issues with type checking and comparison of different data types.

The discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable values are likely due to the inconsistent handling of types within the function. The function is not correctly identifying the data type and comparing it with the index type, leading to incorrect results.

The GitHub issue title "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that the bug is related to corner cases in the get_value method for DateTimeIndex and Float64Index. This aligns with the issues observed in the _convert_key function.

To fix the bug, the type checking and comparison logic within the _convert_key function needs to be revised. The function should properly identify the type of the key and compare it with the index type to ensure consistency. Additionally, handling of different data types should be done in a more robust manner to avoid unexpected results.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (float, int)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Float64 index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, ax.dtype.type):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Index type mismatch"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles different index types and their corresponding key types appropriately, ensuring that the comparisons are done consistently. This should resolve the issues observed and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
