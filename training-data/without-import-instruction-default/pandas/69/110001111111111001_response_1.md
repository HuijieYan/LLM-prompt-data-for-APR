The bug is caused by the incorrect type checking in the `_convert_key` function. The function checks if the index is an integer type, but it doesn't handle the case where the index is of type float or timedelta.

To fix the bug, we should modify the type checking logic in the `_convert_key` function to handle float and timedelta indexes appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.int64, float, np.float64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer or float index "
                    "can only have integer or float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, np.timedelta64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index "
                    "can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported index type")

    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should now correctly handle different types of indexes, such as integer, float, and timedelta indexes, and the failing test should pass successfully.
