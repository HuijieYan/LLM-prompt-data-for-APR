The error in the `_convert_key` function is related to the comparison of integer and non-integer values in the key to the index axes. The current implementation is not handling the different types of index correctly.

The failing test error message indicates that there is a ValueError occurring when attempting to perform based indexing on an integer or non-integer index. This suggests that the function is not handling the different data types as expected.

To fix this bug, the function `_convert_key` should be modified to handle different index types and ensure that based indexing is performed consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Index) and isinstance(i, (float, int)):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        else:
            if i not in ax:
                raise KeyError(f"{i} not in index")  # handle non-existent keys

    return key
```

With this change, the function handles different index types properly and ensures that based indexing is performed consistently.

This corrected code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
