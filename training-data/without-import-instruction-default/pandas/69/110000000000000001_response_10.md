1. The buggy function is supposed to convert the key to the same type as the index. However, there are some logical errors and potential syntax issues in the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it checks for the type of the index and the key.

3. The buggy function is trying to check if the key types match the index types. However, there are some syntax errors such as "is_integer" which should be a method call and "is_integer" should be "ax.is_integer()" and "is_integer(i)" should be "i.is_integer()".

4. To fix the bug, we should use the correct method calls for checking if the key types match the index types and handle the logic accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not i.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if i.is_integer() and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the `is_integer` method is correctly called on the variables `ax` and `i` to check if the key types match the index types. Additionally, the method `holds_integer` is also correctly called to check the type of the index.
