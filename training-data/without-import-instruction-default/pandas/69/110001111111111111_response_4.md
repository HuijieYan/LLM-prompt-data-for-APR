The issue is caused by the _convert_key function in the indexing.py file. The function checks if the key's type matches the index's type and raises a ValueError if it doesn't. However, it does not handle cases where the index is of type 'float64', and the key is an integer or float. This causes the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _convert_key function to handle cases where the index is of type 'float64'. We can modify the function to cast the key to the same type as the index if the index is of type 'float64'. This will ensure that the key's type matches the index's type, resolving the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = self.obj.index.dtype
    if str(index_type) == 'float64':
        key = type(key)(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key

```

This corrected code should ensure that the key's type matches the index's type, resolving the failing tests and the issue posted on GitHub.
