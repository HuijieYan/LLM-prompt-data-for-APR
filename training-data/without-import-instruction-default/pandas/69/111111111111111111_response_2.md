The issue is occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is not handling cases where the index is a `Float64Index` and the key is a non-integer or a float.

The error occurs when the function is trying to execute the `self.obj.axes.is_integer()` check, causing a ValueError to be raised for non-integer indexes. This is resulting in failing tests for datetime64 and timedelta64 values.

The bug is caused by the `is_integer()` check not properly handling cases where the index is a `Float64Index`. Additionally, the function is not correctly handling the case where a float key is provided.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle cases where the index is a `Float64Index` and the key is a non-integer or a float. This can be achieved by checking the type of the index and key before performing any comparisons and value checks.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, or a float if the index is a Float64Index. 
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

The corrected function now properly checks for the index type and key type before performing any comparisons or checks, ensuring that the function handles both integer and float cases for indexes like `Float64Index`. This correction should fix the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to this bug.
