The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of a class, which takes a key and a boolean `is_setter` as input. The key is iterated through the axes of the object. If an axis is an integer, it checks if the key value is also an integer, if not, it raises a ValueError. If the axis is not an integer, it checks if the key value is also not an integer, if not, it raises a ValueError.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` checks for indexing values in a series where the index is of type `float64` and the key is an integer. This fails because the `_convert_key` method is not handling float values correctly.

The approach to fixing the bug could involve updating the `_convert_key` function to handle float values such as 4.0 and cast them to an integer in cases where the index is of type `float64`.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key` is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and is_integer(float(i)):
                    return int(i)
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers, but received {i}"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    f"At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers, but received {i}"
                )
    return key
```

This updated version of the `_convert_key` method first checks if the axis is of type `Float64Index` and the key is a float, it then casts the float to an integer. It also adds the actual erroneous key in the error message for better debugging. With these changes, the function should pass the failing test.
