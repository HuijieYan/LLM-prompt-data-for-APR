The issue in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file has to do with the `_convert_key` function. It is comparing integers without considering the possibility of floating point numbers. Replace the `_convert_key` function with the corrected version provided below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This change will fix the bug and address the ValueError raised previously when trying to access floating point indexes. After making this change, please re-run the failing test to verify that the issue has been resolved.
