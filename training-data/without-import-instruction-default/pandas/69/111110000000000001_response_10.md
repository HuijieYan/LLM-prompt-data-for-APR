1. The buggy function is the `_convert_key` method within the `_AtIndexer` class. This method is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index for indexing purposes.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for checking the type of the index and the key. It appears that there are some conditions that are not being properly evaluated.

3. The potential bug's cause is that the function is not properly checking the type of the index and the key. This could lead to incorrect indexing and potential errors when using the key to access data from the index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug would include:
   - Properly checking the type of the index and the key
   - Ensuring that the conditions for integer and non-integer indexes and keys are properly evaluated
   - Adding appropriate error handling and messages for the cases where the type of the index and the key do not match

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
In the corrected code, the bug was fixed by modifying the conditions in the `if` and `else` statements to properly check the type of the index and the key. Additionally, appropriate error messages were added for the cases where the type of the index and the key do not match.
