1. The buggy function is called `_convert_key` and is used to convert the key. The function takes in three parameters: `self`, `key`, and `is_setter`. It then checks if `is_setter` is True, and if so, it returns the key as a list. Otherwise, it iterates through the axes of the object and performs checks based on whether the axis is an integer or not and whether the indexer is an integer or not.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop where it iterates through the axes of the object and performs checks.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function performs checks based on the type of axis and indexer, but it incorrectly uses `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` without referencing the correct module or method.

4. To fix the bug, the correct module or method for checking if a variable is an integer should be used. Additionally, the method for checking if an axis holds integers also needs to be corrected.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.dtype == 'int':
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and ax.dtype != 'int':
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
