The buggy function, _convert_key, is used in the _AtIndexer class in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. This function is responsible for converting the key based on certain conditions and checks. The failing test in the pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py file uses this function and is producing a ValueError stating "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This indicates that the bug lies within the _convert_key function's logic related to integer and non-integer indexers.

The problem seems to be in the for loop inside the _convert_key function where it checks for the type of index and raises a ValueError based on the criteria for integer and non-integer indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the for loop of the _convert_key function to correctly identify integer and non-integer indexers and validate the key accordingly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the for loop to properly handle the checks for integer and non-integer indexers. This may involve using the dtype of the index to determine if it's an integer or non-integer index and then performing the validation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.UInt64Index):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should address the issue and pass the failing test by properly handling the validation of integer and non-integer indexers.

With this correction, the bug causing the failing test should be resolved, and the issue posted on GitHub titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" should be considered resolved.
