1. The buggy function is `_convert_key` which is a method of the `_AtIndexer` class. This class is related to the `IndexingMixin.at` function, and it seems to be responsible for converting keys and handling indexing operations.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for integer types and the comparison with the indexing axes.

3. The bug is caused by incorrect type checking and comparison logic within the `_convert_key` function. This function is supposed to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index, but the type checking conditions are not implemented correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Correct the type checking conditions to properly compare the key type with the index type.
   - Refactor the conditional logic to handle different types of indexes more effectively.
   - Use built-in functions for type checking and comparison to ensure accuracy.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
