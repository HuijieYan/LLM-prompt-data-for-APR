Potential Error:
The issue seems to be with the `_convert_key` function. It is not handling non-integer indexers correctly.

Bug's Cause:
The `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexers properly, leading to a ValueError when it encounters non-integer indexers.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexers appropriately.
2. Add a condition to check if the index is non-integer and handle it accordingly.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
            # if the non-integer indexer is found, convert it into the same type as the index
            key = ax._convert_non_integer_indexer(i)
    return key
```

In the `else` block, in case of a non-integer indexer, the function should raise a ValueError only if the indexer is also non-integer. If the indexer is non-integer, it needs to be converted into the same type as the index using a method `_convert_non_integer_indexer` from the index object. This will ensure that the indexer matches the type of the index.

By making these changes, the `_convert_key` function should now handle both integer and non-integer indexers correctly, and the error should be resolved.
