1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the class `_AtIndexer`, which is related to the GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value". The issue mentions that series lookups are affected for the `Float64Index` case, which indicates that the bug is likely related to indexing and retrieving values from a `Float64Index`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for checking the type of the index and the key. There are conditional checks for the index type and the key type, but there seems to be a discrepancy in how these checks are performed.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_convert_key` performs checks on the type of index and key to ensure they match.
   (b). The class `_AtIndexer` is related to indexing operations, which could be related to the bug in the GitHub issue.
   (c). The GitHub issue mentions that series lookups are affected for the `Float64Index` case, indicating that the bug could be related to incorrect key conversion or comparison.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Review and revise the logic for checking the type of the index and the key in the `_convert_key` function.
   - Ensure that the type checks for index and key are performed correctly and consistently, addressing the specific cases mentioned in the GitHub issue.
   - Test the function with different index and key combinations to validate the type conversion and comparison logic.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be of the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
``` 

The corrected code revises the type checks for the index and key, ensuring that the comparison is performed using `isinstance` to accurately determine the type of the values. This correction addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report related to series lookups being affected for the `Float64Index` case.
