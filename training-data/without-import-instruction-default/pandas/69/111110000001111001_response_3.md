The problematic function is `_convert_key`, which is intended to require keys to be of the same type as the index. The bug is likely located in the loop that compares the input key with the index. The loop is meant to raise a ValueError if the input key does not match the type of the index, but it is not currently doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the loop to properly compare the type of the input key with the type of the index. If they do not match, we should raise a ValueError.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, Int64Index):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, float) and not isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-float "
                "index can only have non-float "
                "indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, (datetime, np.datetime64)) and not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-datetime "
                "index can only have non-datetime "
                "indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, (timedelta, np.timedelta64)) and not isinstance(ax, TimedeltaIndex):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-timedelta "
                "index can only have non-timedelta "
                "indexers"
            )
    
    return key
```

This corrected code should now properly compare the type of the input key with the type of the index and raise a ValueError if they do not match. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided in the cases.
