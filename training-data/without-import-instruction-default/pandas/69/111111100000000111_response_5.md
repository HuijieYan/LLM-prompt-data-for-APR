1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer` which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The function is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. The GitHub issue title suggests that there are corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`. This indicates that the issue is related to indexing and accessing values in a Series.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop that iterates through the object's axes and checks the type of the index against the type of the key.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of integer and non-integer indexes. The function attempts to validate the index type and key type, but the checks are not implemented correctly. This results in incorrect behavior when accessing Series values using `get_value` for `DTI` and `Float64Index`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Implementing proper type checks for the index and key
   - Handling integer and non-integer indexes separately
   - Using appropriate methods to check for integer types and non-integer types
   - Reworking the validation logic to ensure that the key matches the index type

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key) if isinstance(key, (list, tuple, pd.Index)) else [key]
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
``` 

This corrected code includes proper type checks for the key, specifically checking for integer and non-integer types based on the index type. It also handles the case when `is_setter` is True, allowing for arbitrary setting of keys. This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
