The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer` which inherits from `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. This function is used to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is failing due to a `ValueError` being raised in the `_convert_key` function when using `ser.at[4]`.

The potential error location within the problematic function `_convert_key` is the for loop that iterates through `self.obj.axes` and `key`. The logic within this for loop is causing the `ValueError` to be raised.

The bug is caused by the incorrect logic within the for loop of the `_convert_key` function. The function is not handling non-integer keys properly, which is leading to the `ValueError` being raised when using `ser.at[4]` in the failing test.

To fix the bug, the logic within the for loop in the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle non-integer keys. This may involve checking the type of the index and the keys to ensure compatibility.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper type checking for the keys, based on the type of the index. This should resolve the `ValueError` being raised in the failing test.
