The buggy function is `_convert_key` in the class `_AtIndexer`. The function is designed to ensure that keys are the same type as the index. However, it currently raises a ValueError in some cases where it should not.

The failing test is testing the behavior of `ser.at[4]` with both `datetime64` and `timedelta64` values. The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is being raised because the function is not handling non-integer index cases correctly.

The expected value of the key `i` is not being handled properly, resulting in the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to handle non-integer index cases correctly. It should check if the index holds integers and handle the key accordingly.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):  # handle non-integer index cases
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This modified function will handle non-integer index cases correctly, and it should pass the failing test. Additionally, it will address the issue reported on GitHub.
