The buggy function is `_convert_key` which is part of the class `_AtIndexer` in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The failing test is in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` and it's failing with a `ValueError`. The error message provides a useful hint as it specifically mentions that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This indicates that there might be an issue with how the function is handling non-integer indexes.

The problematic part of the function is the logic that checks whether the index is an integer or not. It is likely that this logic is incorrectly identifying the non-integer index as an integer index, leading to the `ValueError` being raised.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to correctly identify non-integer indexes and allow non-integer indexers for such cases.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In this modified version, the logic has been updated to properly check for non-integer indexes and handle them accordingly, thus resolving the issue.

This corrected version of the `_convert_key` function should now pass the failing test.
