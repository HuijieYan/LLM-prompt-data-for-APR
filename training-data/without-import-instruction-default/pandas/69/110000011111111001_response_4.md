The issue in the buggy function is that it's not handling the case where the index is a float but the key is an integer. The function is failing with a ValueError in this case, which is causing the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to check the type of the index and handle float and int keys appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)
    if index_type == pd.Float64Index:
        key = key[0] if isinstance(key[0], float) else float(key[0])
    elif index_type == pd.Int64Index:
        key = key[0] if isinstance(key[0], int) else int(key[0])

    return key
```

This corrected code should handle the cases where the index is a float or an integer and ensure that the key is the same type as the index.

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
