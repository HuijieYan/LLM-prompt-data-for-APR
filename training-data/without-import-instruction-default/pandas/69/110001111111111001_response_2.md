Looking at the function `_convert_key`, there are a couple of issues:
1. The function is looping through the `self.obj.axes`, which may not always have the same number of axes as the `key`.
2. The function is checking for integer and non-integer values using `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods, which seem to be invalid methods.

Based on the failing tests and error message, it seems that the function is unable to handle integer and non-integer keys properly for non-integer indexes.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made:
1. Verify that the length of `key` matches the length of `self.obj.axes` before zipping them together.
2. Replace the invalid `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods with appropriate checks for integer and non-integer values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if len(key) != len(self.obj.axes):
        raise ValueError("Length of key must match the number of axes in the index")

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_type_compatible([i]):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function should handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly and pass the failing test cases.
