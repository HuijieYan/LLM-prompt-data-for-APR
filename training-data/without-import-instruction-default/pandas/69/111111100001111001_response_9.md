The bug in the code appears to be in the section that iterates through the axes and checks whether the index is an integer or not. The bug causes the function to raise a ValueError in cases where the index is not an integer, but the key is. This is incorrect behavior, as it should only raise an error if the opposite is true (i.e., if the index is an integer, but the key is not).

This bug likely results from incorrectly checking whether the key is an integer. The current implementation checks whether 'i' is an integer using the 'is_integer' function, which is incorrect. It should be using the 'isinstance' function instead.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where the index is an integer and the key is not, and vice versa. Additionally, the logic for handling is_setter should be improved to align with the expected behavior of the function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):  # check if 'i' is an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():  # check if 'i' is not an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
With this code, the function should now correctly handle cases where the key is an integer and the index is not, or where the key is not an integer and the index is. This should resolve the issues observed in the test cases.
