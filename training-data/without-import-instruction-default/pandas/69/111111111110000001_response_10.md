The issue in the given context is with the `_convert_key` function in the `_AtIndexer` class, which is located in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError when non-integer indexing is attempted on an integer index.

The problem seems to arise from the `for` loop within the `_convert_key` function where it checks for integer type. It seems to be incorrectly handling non-integer indexes as well as integer indexes with non-integer keys. The function is not considering the case where it needs to handle non-integer indexes with integer keys.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly. One approach to fixing the bug would be to check the type of the index and only run the integer check when it's an integer index. When it's a non-integer index, the function should allow non-integer keys but raise an error for integer keys. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
``` 

By implementing this corrected version of the `_convert_key` function, it should handle both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately and pass the failing test.
