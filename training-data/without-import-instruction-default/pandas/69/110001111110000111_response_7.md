Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue lies within the `_convert_key` function in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. The error message indicates that there is a problem with handling non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function.

The failing test is related to Series lookups using Float64Index and the error specifically mentions that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This points to a problem with handling non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function.

To resolve this issue, one possible approach would be to update the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the non-integer indexes. This may involve implementing a check for non-integer indexes and adjusting the logic accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):  # Check if the index is a Float64Index
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):  # Check if the indexer is a float
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # For other types of indexes
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

By adding a check for Float64Index and properly handling non-integer indexers, this updated `_convert_key` function should resolve the issue. It ensures that the function can handle non-integer indexes correctly, which addresses the problem described in the failing test and error message.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
