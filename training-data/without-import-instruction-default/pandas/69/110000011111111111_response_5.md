Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the _convert_key function when it checks whether the index and the key have the same type.

Bug cause:
The _convert_key function is not handling the case when the index is a Float64Index and the key is an integer. It raises a ValueError in such cases, which is not the expected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the _convert_key function to handle the case when the index is a Float64Index and the key is an integer without raising a ValueError.
2. Update the logic in the _convert_key function to correctly handle different types of indexes and keys.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            key = tuple(map(float, key))  # Cast all elements of the key to float
            break  # Exit the loop after casting

    return key
```

With the corrected code, the _convert_key function will check if the index is a Float64Index, and if the key is not a float, it will cast all elements of the key to float. This will handle the different types of indexes and keys correctly, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
