The buggy function is `_convert_key` and it is part of the class `_AtIndexer`. The failing tests are related to the `Float64Index.get_value` method. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the conversion of key values for non-integer indexes.

The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of non-integer index values in the `_convert_key` function. This causes the failing tests to raise a `ValueError` when trying to perform lookups on non-integer index values.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle non-integer index values. Specifically, the function should check if the index is non-integer and then ensure that the key values are also non-integer. 

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is provided below:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected function should now properly handle both integer and non-integer index values, satisfying the failing tests and the expected input/output variable information. It should also resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.

With this updated function, the failing tests should now pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
