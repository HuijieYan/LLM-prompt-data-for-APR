The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the class `_AtIndexer` which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The failing tests are due to the `_convert_key` function not handling the conversion of keys properly for the Float64Index and DatetimeIndex cases.

The error is occurring at the line where the function raises a ValueError when the key is non-integer for a non-integer index. This implies that the function is not properly handling non-integer keys for non-integer indexes.

The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling non-integer keys for non-integer indexes as expected, leading to the ValueError being raised.

The GitHub issue suggests that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to handle non-integer keys for non-integer indexes properly, without raising a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code should handle both integer and non-integer keys for the corresponding indexes without raising a ValueError.

With this corrected code, the failing tests should pass, and the expected input/output variable information should be satisfied. Additionally, the issue posted on GitHub about the bug affecting Series lookups for the Float64Index case should be resolved.
