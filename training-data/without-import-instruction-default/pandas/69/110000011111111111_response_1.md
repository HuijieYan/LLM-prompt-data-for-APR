Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the bug is caused by the `_convert_key` function not handling the conversion of key properly. The function is checking if the key is an integer, but it should also take into account datetimes or timedeltas.

The issue on GitHub mentions that the bug affects Series lookups for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the failing test and error message.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key function needs to be updated to handle both datetime and timedelta indexes. It should check the type of the index and handle conversions accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index "
                    "can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

This updated function checks if the index is a DateTimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex, and handles the conversion of the key accordingly. It also maintains the original functionality for integer indexes.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass and the bug reported on GitHub should be resolved.
