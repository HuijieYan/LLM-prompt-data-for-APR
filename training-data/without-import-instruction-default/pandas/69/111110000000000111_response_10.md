1. The buggy function is part of the class `_AtIndexer`, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the key while performing indexing operations. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" indicates that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, which suggests that the bug may be related to indexing operations involving floating-point index values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional checks for integer and non-integer index values. These checks may not be handling floating-point index values correctly, leading to the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of floating-point index values in the `_convert_key` function. The function is performing checks for integer and non-integer index values, but it may not be handling floating-point values appropriately. This could be causing issues with series lookups for the Float64Index case, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the conditional checks in the `_convert_key` function to handle floating-point index values correctly.
   - Update the logic in the function to ensure that it can appropriately convert keys for indexing operations involving floating-point index values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes adjustments to the conditional checks to handle floating-point index values correctly, ensuring that the function can appropriately convert keys for indexing operations involving different types of index values. The corrected code should address the reported issue with series lookups for the Float64Index case.
