The bug in the _convert_key function is that it does not handle the datetime64 and timedelta64 values correctly, leading to the ValueError being raised.

The issue is that the function currently checks if the index axes are integer, but it should also check if they are of datetime or timedelta type. The input parameters are ignored in the current function logic and the function relies only on the ax values.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check the type of the index axes as well as the type of the input key when appropriate.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
            )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided, as it checks both the type of the index axes and the type of the input key.
