The buggy function is `_convert_key` which is a method of the class `_AtIndexer`. The failing test is testing the lookups for `Float64Index` and during the test, it encounters a `ValueError` with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The cause of the bug seems to be that the `_convert_key` method does not handle non-integer indexers properly when the index is of type Float64Index. This causes the ValueError to be raised during the test.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexers properly when the index is of type Float64Index. It should check if the index is of type Float64Index and handle non-integer indexers accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Float64Index):
            if not is_integer(i) and not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a Float64 index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected version, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass. Additionally, the GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" should also be resolved.
