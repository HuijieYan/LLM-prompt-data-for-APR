Potential error location: The if statement checking if ax is an integer is using the method is_integer() instead of the isinstance() function. This could lead to a ValueError being raised when it is not necessary.

Bug's cause: The buggy function is checking if the index is an integer using the method is_integer(), which is not a valid method for checking the type of the index. This is causing the ValueError to be raised incorrectly.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the isinstance() function to check if the index is of integer type.
2. Use the same approach for checking if the index is non-integer type.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we are using the isinstance() function to check the type of the index and the indexer, which ensures that the ValueError is only raised when necessary.
