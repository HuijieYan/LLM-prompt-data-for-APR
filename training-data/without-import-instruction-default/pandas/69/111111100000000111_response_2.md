1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the class `_AtIndexer` which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The function is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index and checking for specific conditions based on the type of index.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" suggests that there is an issue with series lookups for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the conditional checks for integer indices and non-integer indices. It seems that the checks may not be functioning as intended, leading to incorrect behavior for series lookups for the Float64Index.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to the flawed conditional checks in the `_convert_key` function. The function is not handling the cases for integer and non-integer indices properly, leading to unexpected behavior for series lookups.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the conditional checks in the `_convert_key` function to ensure they accurately distinguish between integer and non-integer indices.
   - Refactoring the conditional checks to align with the expected behavior for series lookups, particularly for the Float64Index case.
   - Adding appropriate error handling and messages to clearly indicate issues with index type mismatches.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code includes updated conditional checks to properly distinguish between integer and non-integer indices, along with improved error handling and messages. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
