The buggy function is _convert_key in the _AtIndexer class. The function is supposed to handle different types of keys based on the index type. However, it fails to properly handle integer and non-integer indexes.

The error message indicates that when handling non-integer indexes, the function raises a ValueError. This is due to the incorrect handling of non-integer indexes in the _convert_key function.

The cause of the bug is that the _convert_key function does not properly check for non-integer indexes and raises an error when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _convert_key function to properly handle both integer and non-integer indexes. We can achieve this by checking the index type before performing any validation.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not (isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)) or np.issubdtype(type(i), np.datetime64)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)) or isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)) or np.issubdtype(type(i), np.datetime64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-float, non-datetime, non-timedelta index can only have non-float, non-datetime, non-timedelta indexers"
                )

    return key
```
This corrected function includes proper checks for different index types and their respective key types, ensuring that the function handles integer and non-integer indexes appropriately.

The corrected function directly addresses the issue reported in the failing tests and expected input/output variable information.

This fix should fully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Once this fix is verified, it can be submitted as a pull request to the pandas repository.
