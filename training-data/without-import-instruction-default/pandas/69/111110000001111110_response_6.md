Fixed the _convert_key function to iterate over self.obj.axes[0] (assuming it's the actual index) to check the type of elements in the key. Replaced the is_integer and holds_integer functions with isinstance to check the type explicitly and raised a ValueError accordingly. Also made the comparison between i and the index type explicit in each condition.
