The problematic function is `_convert_key`, which is called internally in the assertion `result = ser.at[4]` within the failing test function. The error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers," and it is failing at the else block of the `_convert_key` function.

The issue seems to be with the check for non-integer indexing. The condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` is not handling the non-integer indexers properly, leading to the ValueError being raised. This indicates that the function is incorrectly handling non-integer indexing.

To fix the bug, the check for non-integer indexing needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexers appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
With this correction, the function should handle the non-integer indexing correctly and pass the failing test.
