The problematic function is `_convert_key`. The function is used in the context of indexing in pandas and is responsible for converting the input key into a suitable format for indexing.

The error message from the failing test indicates that there is a ValueError being raised in the `_convert_key` function. It specifically mentions that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers", which suggests that the function is not handling non-integer indexes and indexers correctly.

The GitHub issue also confirms that there are corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value, which suggests that the issue is related to indexing and value retrieval for specific data types.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexes and indexers correctly. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to differentiate between integer and non-integer indexes and indexers, and allow for appropriate conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):  # check for integer type
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):  # check for non-integer type
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The changes made in the corrected code include using the `isinstance` function to check the type of the index and indexer and raise a ValueError accordingly.

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle integer and non-integer indexes and indexers, and should pass the failing test. This will also address the specific issue reported in the GitHub bug.
