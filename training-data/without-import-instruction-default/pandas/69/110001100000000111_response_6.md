Potential Error Location: The potential error is located in the for loop where the function iterates through the object's axes and the key simultaneously. 

Bug's Cause:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of integer and non-integer indexes. The function is checking if the index is an integer and then comparing it with the type of the key passed. The error messages indicate that there is a discrepancy in handling integer and non-integer indexes and indexers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic inside the for loop to properly handle integer and non-integer indexers based on the type of the index.
2. Refactor the code to use built-in methods for type checking and comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
