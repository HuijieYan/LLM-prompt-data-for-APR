The buggy function is `_convert_key` in the class `_AtIndexer`. This function is responsible for converting the key based on certain conditions and is used by the indexing methods like `at` and `loc`.

The failing test checks for indexing operations using `ser.at[4]`, which is throwing a ValueError due to the type mismatch. The error message indicates that the code is checking for a non-integer index with non-integer indexers.

The potential error location is within the loop that iterates over the axes and key. It checks for the type of the index and the type of the key. The error is caused due to the mismatch between the types.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and the key before comparing and raising errors.
2. Modify the logic for type checking to accommodate for datetime and timedelta indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index can only have datetime or timedelta indexers")
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
    return key
```

The modified function includes specific type checking for datetime and timedelta indexes and raises the ValueError accordingly. This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
