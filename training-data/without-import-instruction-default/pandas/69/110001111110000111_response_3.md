The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the pandas package and is used to convert keys to the same type as the index. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the handling of non-integer indexes when performing At based indexing.

The failing test is related to the Float64Index case and it is failing due to a ValueError that is raised during At based indexing on a non-integer index.

The GitHub issue title indicates that there are corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value functions.

To fix the bug, one possible approach would be to revise the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle non-integer indexes during At based indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

By making sure to use the proper function to check for an integer (`pd.api.types.is_integer`), we ensure that the correct type checking is performed. With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
