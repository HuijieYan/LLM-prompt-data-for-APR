The bug in the function is that it is checking if the index is an integer, but it should be checking if the index is an instance of pandas' Index objects. Additionally, the function should compare the type of the index with the type of the key, not whether it's an integer or not.

To fix this bug, we should use the isinstance function to check if the index is an instance of an Index object, and then compare the types of the index and the key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Index) and not type(ax) == type(i):
            raise ValueError("Mismatched index and key types")
    return key
```

This corrected function will now compare the types of the index and the key, ensuring that they are compatible. This should fix the bug and satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
