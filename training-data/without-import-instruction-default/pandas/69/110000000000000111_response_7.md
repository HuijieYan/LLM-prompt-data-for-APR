1. The buggy function seems to be related to Series lookups and indexing on integer and non-integer indexes. The GitHub issue title suggests that there are corner cases in DTI.get_value and Float64Index.get_value, which are related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the for loop where it checks the type of index and raises a ValueError if certain conditions are not met.

3. The bug's cause seems to be related to the way the function is checking for integer and non-integer indexers, and how it is handling the Float64Index case. The GitHub issue further confirms that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case, indicating that the bug is likely related to this specific type of index.

4. To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle the Float64Index case and ensure that the Series lookups are not affected. This may involve revising the logic for checking the type of index and ensuring it aligns with the Float64Index case.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if hasattr(ax, 'is_integer') and ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not hasattr(ax, 'holds_integer') and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds checks for the presence of certain methods and attributes before using them, and also adjusts the logic for handling integer and non-integer indexers to better accommodate the Float64Index case.
