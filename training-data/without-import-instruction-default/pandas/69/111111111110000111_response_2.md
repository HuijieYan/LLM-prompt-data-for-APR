The problematic function `_convert_key` is responsible for the error. This function is part of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. The function is meant to require keys to be the same type as the index, to avoid fallback. It checks whether the index is an integer type or not and raises a ValueError if the index and key types do not match.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` in `pandas/tests/indexes/test_numeric.py` utilizes this `_AtIndexer` class and triggers the error by calling the `ser.at[4]` method. The error message clearly indicates the cause of the problem, stating that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" provides a detailed description of the problem and highlights that series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the case where a non-integer index is present. One approach to fix the bug is to modify the condition checking for non-integer indexes to handle the float index case differently. We need to allow float indexers to be used for non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, float)) and not ax.holds_integer():
                continue  # allow float indexers for non-integer indexes
            else:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code allows float indexers to be used for non-integer indexes, which resolves the issue highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
