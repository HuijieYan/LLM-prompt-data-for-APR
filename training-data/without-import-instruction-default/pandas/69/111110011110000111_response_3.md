1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is inherited from the `_ScalarAccessIndexer` class and also has a decorator `@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)`.
   - The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is trying to perform various lookups using `ser.at[4]`, and it is failing with a `ValueError`.
   - The error message indicates that the issue is with non-integer indexers in the `at` based indexing.

2. Potential Error Location:
   - The error seems to be occurring in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class.

3. Bug's Cause:
   - The `_convert_key` method is supposed to convert keys to the same type as the index. There are checks for integer and non-integer indexers, but it seems that the current implementation is causing issues with non-integer indexers.

4. Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
   - Update the `_convert_key` method to handle non-integer indexers appropriately.
   - Modify the checks for integer and non-integer indexers to handle the specific cases mentioned in the failing test.

5. Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
The corrected code now includes specific handling for non-integer indexers in the `else` branch of the `for` loop.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and pass the failing test. It ensures that the `_convert_key` method handles both integer and non-integer indexers correctly, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
