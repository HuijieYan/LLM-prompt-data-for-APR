1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is a method that is part of the pandas library. It is being called within the `get_value` method of the `Float64Index` class. The failing test is trying to perform various lookups on a Series using different keys and index types.

2. The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is the part where it is checking if an index is integer or not and raising a ValueError if the conditions are not met.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_convert_key` function is not properly handling index conversions for integer and non-integer indexes, leading to the ValueError being raised.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the `_convert_key` function is able to handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly.
   - Adding proper type checking and conversion logic to the function.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes using `pd.api.types.is_integer` for type checking, and adjusting the error messages to accurately reflect the conditions. This corrected code should address the issues reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
