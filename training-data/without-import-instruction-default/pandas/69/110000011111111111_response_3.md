The issue seems to be related to the `_convert_key` function, which is used to ensure that keys are the same type as the index. This is causing problems with lookups for the `Float64Index` case.

The error message indicates that when the `at` method is used with an integer index, it is not correctly cast to a non-integer index. This suggests that the `_convert_key` function is failing to handle cases where the index is not of integer type.

The actual input/output variable information shows that the `key` is converted into a list but is not properly checked for integer type, which causes the error.

The GitHub issue title indicates that this bug affects corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated to properly handle non-integer index cases. It should check if the index is of integer type and ensure that the key is also of integer type for integer indexes and non-integer type for non-integer indexes.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code checks the type of the index and compares it with the type of the key to ensure they match appropriately.

With this update, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
