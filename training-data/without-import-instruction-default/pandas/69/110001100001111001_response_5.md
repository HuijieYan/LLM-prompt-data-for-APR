The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the types of the index and the key. The function should check if the key matches the index in terms of integer vs non-integer types, and raise a ValueError if there is a mismatch.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to correctly identify the type of the index and the key and raise a ValueError if there is a mismatch. We can do this by using the isinstance() function to check if the index and key are of the same type, and if not, raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly check if the key matches the index in terms of integer vs non-integer types, and raise a ValueError if there is a mismatch. This should resolve the bug and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
