The buggy function is `_convert_key` which is part of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. This function is used to convert the key to a specific type based on the index and whether it's a setter.

The error occurs when the function encounters a non-integer index and attempts to handle it as an integer index. This results in a `ValueError` being raised when the key is converted.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle non-integer indexes and integer indexes based on the type of the index.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer and integer indexes. This could involve checking the type of the index and the type of the key being passed in, and raising an error if there is a mismatch.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(ax):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key

```

This updated code checks for the type of the index and the type of the key being passed in, ensuring that non-integer indexes are handled properly and raising a `ValueError` if there is a mismatch. This should fix the issues encountered in the failing test.
