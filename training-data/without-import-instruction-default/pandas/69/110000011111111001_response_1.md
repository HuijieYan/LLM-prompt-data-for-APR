The potential error in the buggy function is in the logic used to check if the index and keys are of the same type. It currently raises a ValueError when the index is non-integer and the key is an integer. This logic is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

The failing test calls the function `_convert_key` as part of the indexing process, and it expects that when an integer key is used to index a non-integer index, it should be cast to a floating-point value.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to handle the case when an integer key is used to index a non-integer index. Instead of raising a ValueError, it should cast the integer key to a floating-point value to match the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. If the index is non-integer and
    the key is an integer, cast the key to a floating-point value.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    converted_key = []
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            converted_key.append(float(i))
        else:
            converted_key.append(i)

    return tuple(converted_key)
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will now correctly handle the case when an integer key is used on a non-integer index and will cast it to a floating-point value, resolving the failing test and error message.
