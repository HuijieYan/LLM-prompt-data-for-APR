Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the validation of index types in the _convert_key function. It is not correctly handling cases where the index is a Float64Index or a non-integer index.

Bug cause: The function is not handling cases where the index is a Float64Index or a non-integer index properly, leading to unexpected behavior during lookups.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of index and handle cases where it is a Float64Index or non-integer index differently.
2. Update the validation logic to correctly handle different index types.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
            )
        if not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-float index can only have non-float indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code should handle cases where the index is a Float64Index or a non-integer index correctly, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided. It also resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
