The issue lies in the `_convert_key` function, specifically the condition checks inside the for loop.

The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is raised because "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". This suggests that the logic inside the for loop is incorrectly checking for integer and non-integer indices.

To fix this bug, the for loop should be modified to correctly check whether the index is an integer or non-integer, and then raise a `ValueError` if an attempt is made to use an index of the wrong type for the given axis.

Corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # Modified logic to correctly check for non-integer indices
            if not is_integer(i) and i is not None:  # Check if i is not None to allow for missing values
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )

    return key
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
