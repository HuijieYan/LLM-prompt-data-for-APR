1. The buggy function is a part of the class `_AtIndexer` which is inheriting from `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The function `_convert_key` is used to convert the key into a specific format before processing it further.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the validation logic for the key. It checks if the key is an integer and if the corresponding axis holds an integer.

3. The bug's cause is:
   (a). The buggy function does not handle the case where the key is not of the same type as the index.
   (b). The buggy class may have a mismatch between the type of key and the type of the index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a type check to ensure the key matches the type of the index.
   - Using appropriate methods or functions to handle different key types.
   - Properly handling exceptions and providing informative error messages.

5. Corrected code:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
                key = [key]
            return key
        else:
            if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
                key = [key]

        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        return key
```
