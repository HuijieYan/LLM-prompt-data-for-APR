The buggy function `_convert_key` in the `_AtIndexer` class of the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file is causing the error. This function is responsible for converting the key into a specific type based on the index, and it is failing for certain cases, as evidenced by the failing test.

The error message indicates that the function is not handling non-integer indexes properly, causing a ValueError to be raised. This is likely due to the conditional checks in the function that are not handling non-integer indexes correctly.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks in the `_convert_key` function need to be modified to properly handle non-integer indexes. Additionally, the function should also be able to handle datetime and timedelta values correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index "
                    "can only have datetime or timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Timedelta)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-datetime, non-timedelta index "
                    "can only have non-datetime, non-timedelta indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should handle the datetime and timedelta cases properly and resolve the bug. It should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
