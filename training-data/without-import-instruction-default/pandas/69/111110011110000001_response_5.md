The buggy function `_convert_key` is used within the class `_AtIndexer`. This function checks whether the key is an integer or non-integer and raises a ValueError if it does not match the type.

The failing test 'test_lookups_datetimelike_values' is trying to access a value at index 4 using 'ser.at[4]'. The test is failing with a ValueError indicating that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The root cause of this bug appears to be the logic within the `_convert_key` function that checks whether the key is an integer or non-integer. It seems that the logic is incorrectly raising a ValueError when it shouldn't be in this specific case.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic within the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the case for non-integer indexes.

Here's a corrected version of the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function should now correctly handle non-integer indexes without raising a ValueError in cases where it is unnecessary. This change should ensure that the failing test 'test_lookups_datetimelike_values' will pass.
