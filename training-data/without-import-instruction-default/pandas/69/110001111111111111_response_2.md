The bug is caused by the _convert_key function not properly handling the case when the index is of type Float64Index and the input key is of type int. The error message indicates that the bug occurs in the _convert_key function when it encounters a non-integer index and an integer key.

To fix this bug, the _convert_key function needs to properly handle the case when the index is of type Float64Index and the input key is of type int. We can achieve this by checking the type of the index and the type of the key, and then perform the necessary validation based on the types.

Here's the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex) and not np.issubdtype(i, np.datetime64):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex) and not np.issubdtype(i, np.timedelta64):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code should handle the different types of indexes (Float64Index, DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex) and the corresponding types of keys (int, float, datetime, timedelta) as per the expected input/output variable information and the failing test case.

By using this corrected code, the failing test should pass and also resolve the issue posted on GitHub about corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value.
