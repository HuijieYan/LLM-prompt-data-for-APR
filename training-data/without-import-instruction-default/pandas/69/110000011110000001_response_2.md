Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the logic related to checking whether the index is integer or non-integer and validating the type of indexers.

Bug's cause:
The `_convert_key` function is intended to ensure that the keys are of the same type as the index and to perform type validation based on the index type. The error message indicates that the function is raising a `ValueError` related to non-integer indexers when it shouldn't.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the validation for integer and non-integer indexers.
2. Ensure that the function appropriately validates the type of indexers based on the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code addresses the issues and should allow the `_convert_key` function to pass the failing test by handling the integer and non-integer validations appropriately.
