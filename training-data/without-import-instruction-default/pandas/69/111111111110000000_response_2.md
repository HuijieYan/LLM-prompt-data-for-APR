The buggy function needs to properly handle the conversion of keys for at-based indexing on non-integer indexes. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't
    fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the function now properly checks for non-integer indexes and correctly handles the conversion of keys for at-based indexing. With this correction, the provided failing test should pass without raising any errors.
