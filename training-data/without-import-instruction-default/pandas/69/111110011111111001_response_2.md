The issue with the `_convert_key` function is that it is not handling the case of non-integer keys properly when the `is_setter` flag is False. It is not considering non-integer values correctly when validating against the index.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer keys properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not pd.api.types.is_float(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will now properly handle non-integer indexers when the `is_setter` flag is False, as required by the failing tests. This should also match the expected input/output variable information provided and resolve the bug in the problematic function.
