The buggy function in question is the `_convert_key` function. This function is part of the class `_AtIndexer`, which is a subclass of `_ScalarAccessIndexer`. The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is calling the `ser.at[4]` method, which is relying on the `_convert_key` function to convert the key before performing the lookup. 

The error message indicates that the bug is occurring when the `_convert_key` function is checking if the index is of type integer and then attempting to convert it to integer. The error message explicitly states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers." This means that the function is not handling non-integer indexes properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle non-integer indexes. It should check if the index is of type integer and then if the indexer is also of type integer. If the index is not of type integer, it should only accept non-integer indexers.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
            elif not pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected version of the `_convert_key` function should handle both integer and non-integer indexes properly, and it should pass the failing test.
