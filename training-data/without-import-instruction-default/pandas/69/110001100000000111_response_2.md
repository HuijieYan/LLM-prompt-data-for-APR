The buggy function "_convert_key" is a method in the pandas package, specifically in the indexing module. It is meant to handle conversion of keys based on the index type. The function takes in a key and a boolean flag "is_setter" which indicates if the key is being used to set values. However, the function has several issues.

The potential error location within the function is the "for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key)" loop. The loop iterates through the axes of the object and the corresponding key values. The issue is likely related to the conditional statements within the loop that check for integer values.

The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" describes a problem with Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case. This suggests that the bug may be related to how integer and non-integer indexes are being handled, which aligns with the conditional checks in the _convert_key function.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks within the for loop need to be revised to accurately assess the index and key values. Additionally, the handling of Float64Index cases needs to be specifically addressed, as indicated by the GitHub issue.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return key.tolist()

    for i, ax in zip(key, self.obj.axes[0]):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, the conditional checks have been revised to accurately handle integer and non-integer index cases. Additionally, for the "is_setter" case, the "key" is converted to a list using the "tolist()" method. This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
