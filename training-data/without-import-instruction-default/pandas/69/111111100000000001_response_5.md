1. The buggy function is a part of the class `_AtIndexer`, which is inheriting from `_ScalarAccessIndexer` and is related to the `IndexingMixin.at` function. The function `_convert_key` is responsible for converting the given key to a suitable format depending on whether it is used for setting or getting values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'for' loop where it iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the key has the same type as the index.

3. The potential cause of the bug:
   (a). The `for` loop might not be iterating properly through the axes of the object.
   (b). The conditional checks within the loop may not be accurately determining if the key has the same type as the index.
   (c). The function may not be handling the cases of integer and non-integer indexes correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Verify that the `for` loop is correctly iterating through the axes of the object.
   (b). Review the conditional checks to ensure they accurately determine if the key has the same type as the index.
   (c). Implement a more robust method of handling integer and non-integer indexes.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):

    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
        
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```

In the corrected code:
1. The conditional checks within the `for` loop have been modified to accurately determine if the key has the same type as the index.
2. The handling of integer and non-integer indexes has been improved to ensure the correct type of indexers is used for the given key.
