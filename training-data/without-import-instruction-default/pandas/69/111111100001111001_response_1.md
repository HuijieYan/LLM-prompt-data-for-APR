The bug in the _convert_key function appears to be in the loop that checks the type of the keys. The loop is checking for the type of the values in "key" and comparing them to the type of the values in the index "ax". However, the loop should be checking whether the types of "key" and the index "ax" match, rather than comparing the types of individual values within "key" and "ax".

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to compare the types of "key" and "ax" as a whole, rather than individual elements within them. This can be achieved by using the isinstance() function to check if the types match.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
