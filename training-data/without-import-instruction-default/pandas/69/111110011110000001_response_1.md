The buggy function is `_convert_key` which is part of the `_AtIndexer` class. The failing test is trying to use `ser.at[4]` and `ser.at[4.0]` which is causing the error. The error message indicates that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The issue in the `_convert_key` function is that it is not correctly handling integer and non-integer indexes. It is raising a `ValueError` when the indexing does not match the index type.

To fix this issue, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to handle the case where an integer is passed for a non-integer index. It should cast the integer to a non-integer index to match the index behavior. This will ensure that the `ser.at[4]` and `ser.at[4.0]` calls work correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    key = pd.Index(key)  # cast the key to a pandas Index to handle integer and non-integer indexes
    return key
```

With this modification, the `_convert_key` function will handle integer and non-integer indexes appropriately and the failing test should pass.
