1. The buggy function is a method that is part of a class. It takes in a key and a boolean flag is_setter, and it checks whether the key is of the same type as the index.

2. The potential error location within the function is the comparison of the key type with the index type, and the corresponding error messages being raised.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly checking the type of the key and raising errors based on the comparison with the index type. Additionally, there are undefined functions such as is_integer and holds_integer.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use isinstance to compare the type of the key with the index type.
   - Define the is_integer and holds_integer functions or replace them with appropriate checks.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                "can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and isinstance(ax, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we use isinstance to compare the type of the key with the index type. We also removed the undefined functions and replaced them with appropriate checks.
