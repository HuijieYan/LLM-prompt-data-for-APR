The bug in the function is that it is not correctly identifying whether the index is an integer or not. It is also not handling the different types of input keys correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_convert_key` function to handle different types of input keys and correctly identify the type of the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    index_type = type(self.obj.index)

    if index_type == pd.Float64Index and all(isinstance(i, (int, float)) for i in key):
        return key
    elif index_type == pd.TimedeltaIndex and all(isinstance(i, (pd.Timedelta, int, float)) for i in key):
        return key
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid key type for the index")
```

With this correction, the function will correctly identify the index type and handle different types of input keys based on the type of the index. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected for all the given test cases.
