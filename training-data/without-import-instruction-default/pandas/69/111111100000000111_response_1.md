The problematic function is _convert_key within the class _AtIndexer in the indexing.py file of the pandas library. The function is responsible for converting keys to the same type as the index, ensuring that the keys are valid for indexing.

The potential error location within the function is the for loop that iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the keys are valid for indexing. The function checks if the axis is an integer and then compares the type of the key to the type of the axis.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect comparisons and validations within the for loop, leading to incorrect key conversion and index type checks.

To fix the bug, the comparisons and validations within the for loop need to be revised to accurately check if the keys are valid for indexing based on the type of the axis.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code will accurately check the type of the keys against the type of the axis, ensuring that the keys are valid for indexing. It resolves the issue posted on GitHub related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.
