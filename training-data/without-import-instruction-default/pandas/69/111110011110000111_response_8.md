Upon analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class, test code, error message, and the GitHub issue, the potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the _convert_key method. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError being raised when using the at method with a non-integer index.

The cause of the bug is that the _convert_key method is not handling non-integer indexes properly, leading to the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the _convert_key method needs to be modified to handle non-integer indexes appropriately, ensuring that it allows non-integer indexers for non-integer indexes.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately. The fix should ensure that the failing test passes and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
