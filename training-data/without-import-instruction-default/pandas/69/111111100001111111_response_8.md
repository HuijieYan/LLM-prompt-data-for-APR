The potential error in the problematic function lies in the loop where it checks if the index is an integer or not. The function is not handling non-integer indexers correctly, leading to the failure of the tests.

The bug is caused by the function not properly identifying the type of index and failing to handle non-integer indexers appropriately, as indicated by the discrepancies in the expected and actual output of the function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle non-integer indexers and validate them based on the type of index. This can be achieved by modifying the logic of the loop that checks the index type and handles non-integer indexers accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timestamp):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime index can only have datetime indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, pd.Timedelta):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a timedelta index can only have timedelta indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code handles the different types of indexes (datetime, timedelta, and integer) and validates the indexers accordingly. It satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
