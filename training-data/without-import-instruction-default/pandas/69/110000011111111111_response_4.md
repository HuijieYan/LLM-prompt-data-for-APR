The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling integer and non-integer indexes correctly, leading to a ValueError being raised in certain cases. This causes the failing test to fail because the function does not return the expected value in these specific scenarios.

The bug is likely located in the `_convert_key` function where it checks for integer and non-integer indexes and their corresponding keys. The function is not handling the cases where the key and index do not match in terms of integer or non-integer types.

The failing test is checking for various lookups in a Series with datetime64 and timedelta64 values, making sure they are wrapped correctly, and the bug is causing the test to fail due to incorrect handling of integer and non-integer keys.

The GitHub issue title describes the bug as affecting corner cases in `DTI.get_value` and `Float64Index.get_value`, specifically related to Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case.

To fix the bug:
1. A conditional check should be added to ensure that when the index is integer or non-integer, the type of the key should match accordingly.
2. If the key and index do not match in terms of integer or non-integer types, appropriate handling should be implemented to avoid raising a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) or isinstance(i, float) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected function will handle the cases of integer and non-integer indexes and their corresponding keys, and should pass the failing test while also satisfying the expected input/output variable information.
