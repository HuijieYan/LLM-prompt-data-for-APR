Based on the analysis provided, the cause of the bug is due to the logic in the `_convert_key` function. The function is checking if the index type is integer or non-integer, but the values in the key are being treated as float in both the cases. This is leading to the ValueError when the key values are non-integer. To fix the bug, the function should not check for integer or non-integer types in the key when the index is of type float. 

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to handle float values appropriately based on the type of the index.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, float):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a float index can only have float indexers")
        if not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) and not isinstance(i, type(ax)):
            raise ValueError(f"At based indexing on an {type(ax).__name__} index can only have {type(ax).__name__} indexers")

    return key
```

This corrected function will handle both integer and non-integer indexes appropriately. It should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
