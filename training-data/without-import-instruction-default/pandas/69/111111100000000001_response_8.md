1. The buggy function "_convert_key" is part of the class "_AtIndexer" which is part of the pandas module. This function is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index.

2. The potential error lies within the for loop where it checks the type of the index compared to the key. It seems like there might be a problem with the logic of this comparison.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect comparison logic in the for loop. Additionally, the function is missing a check for whether the key and index are of the same length, which could also lead to errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check to ensure the length of the key matches the length of the index
   - Correcting the logic within the for loop to properly compare the types of the key and index

5. Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if len(key) != len(self.obj.axes[0]):
        raise ValueError("Key length does not match index length")

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
