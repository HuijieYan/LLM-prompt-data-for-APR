Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the handling of integer and non-integer indexes in the function `_convert_key`. It is trying to validate the keys based on the type of index, but the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes seems to be incorrect.

Bug cause: The bug seems to be caused by incorrect validation of integer and non-integer indexes in the `_convert_key` function, leading to incorrect behavior for Series lookups with Float64Index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for checking integer and non-integer indexes to correctly validate the keys based on the type of index.
2. Add proper type checking and error handling to ensure that the function behaves correctly for different index types.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                raise ValueError(
                    "Integer based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report by properly validating the keys based on the type of index and handling the corner cases for Series lookups with Float64Index.
