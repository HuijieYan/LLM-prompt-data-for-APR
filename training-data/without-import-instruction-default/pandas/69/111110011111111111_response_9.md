The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that checks if the index is an integer and if the key is an integer. This logic seems to be the cause of the ValueError being raised in the failing test.

The failing test `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is expecting a specific type of result when using the `ser.at[4]` attribute access, but the buggy function is not handling this case correctly.

The failing tests are checking if a specific value can be retrieved from the series using different indexing methods, and it's failing with a ValueError because the logic in the `_convert_key` function is not correctly handling cases where an integer key is used with a non-integer index.

The GitHub issue "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" describes Series lookups being affected for the Float64Index case, which aligns with the failing tests and the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` function to handle cases where an integer key is used with a non-integer index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if all(isinstance(i, int) for i in key):
        return [float(i) for i in key]

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code will handle cases where an integer key is used with a non-integer index by converting the integer key to a float before performing the checks. This should resolve the ValueError being raised in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
