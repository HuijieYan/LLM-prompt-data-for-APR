The potential error in the buggy function lies in the for loop, where it checks whether the index is an integer or not. There are discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values due to the incorrect handling of data types.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly identify the data types of the index and key elements.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(ax, (DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex)):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a datetime or timedelta index "
                    "can only have integer or float indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code will now correctly handle the different types of indexes and their corresponding key values, as per the expected input/output variable information provided.
