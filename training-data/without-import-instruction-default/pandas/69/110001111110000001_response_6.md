The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to convert the key used for indexing. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the key conversion when using the `ser.at[4]` operation.

The error occurs due to the implementation of the `_convert_key` function. Specifically, the error is caused by the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()`. This condition is incorrectly checking for integers and non-integers.

To fix the bug, the condition `if is_integer(i) and not ax.holds_integer()` should be changed to `if not is_integer(i) and ax.holds_integer()` so that it correctly checks for non-integers and indexes that require non-integer values.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if ax.holds_integer() and not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this change, the `_convert_key` function will correctly handle indexing based on integers and non-integers, and the failing test should pass.
