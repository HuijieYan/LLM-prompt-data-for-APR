The issue in the buggy function is that it is not correctly handling the data type of the index when checking whether the key is an integer or not. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not isinstance(i, ax.dtype.type):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on {ax.dtype.type} index "
                f"can only have {ax.dtype.type} indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function checks if the type of the key matches the type of the index and raises a ValueError if they don't match. This should handle both integer and non-integer indexes correctly. The fix involves using the `isinstance` function to check the type explicitly.

This correction should address the failing tests and fix the bug in the original function, ensuring that the key type matches the index type.
