1. The buggy function `_convert_key` is part of the `_AtIndexer` class in the file `pandas/core/indexing.py`. This function is used to convert a key to the same type as the index. The GitHub issue titled "BUG: corner cases in DTI.get_value, Float64Index.get_value" mentions that Series lookups are affected for the Float64Index case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the validation and handling of different types of keys and indices.

3. The bug is likely caused by the function not properly handling cases where the key and index are of different types, specifically for the Float64Index case. The validation and conversion of the key to match the index type may not be implemented correctly in the `_convert_key` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Implementing proper type checking and conversion logic for the key and index types.
   - Reviewing the code to ensure that the function handles different types of indices correctly, especially in the case of Float64Index.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return key.tolist()
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a Float64Index can only have float indexers"
                    )
            elif isinstance(ax, pd.IntegerIndex):
                if not isinstance(i, int):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an IntegerIndex can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if type(ax) != type(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "Index type should match key type for indexing"
                    )
        return key
```

This corrected code includes proper type checking for different index types such as Float64Index and IntegerIndex. It also performs the necessary conversion for setting keys to a list. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
