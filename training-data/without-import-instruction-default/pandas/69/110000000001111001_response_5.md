The issue with the current implementation is that the function is trying to check whether the index of the Series is an integer or not, but it is instead checking the type of the index value itself. This is causing a mismatch in the type check, as floats are being interpreted as non-integer values.

To fix this, we need to check the type of the index value, rather than the type of the index itself.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code should satisfy all the provided cases for the expected input/output variable information.
