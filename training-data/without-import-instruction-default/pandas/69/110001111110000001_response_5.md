The buggy function `_convert_key` is used to ensure that keys are the same type as the index. The failing test function `test_lookups_datetimelike_values` is trying to verify the behavior of the `ser.at[4]` method, and is raising a `ValueError` with the message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers". 

This suggests that there is a problem in the `_convert_key` function when dealing with non-integer indexes.

Based on the failing test and error message, the issue appears to be in the for loop that iterates through the axes and keys. It is likely that the function is incorrectly handling non-integer indexes and indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to explicitly handle non-integer indexes and indexers. This can be achieved by removing the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` checks and updating the conditional statements accordingly. We can simply check if the axis is an instance of `IntegerArray` or not, and then validate the key based on that. Additionally, we need to handle the case when an integer key is provided for a non-integer index, and vice versa.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, IntegerArray):
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
            if not ax._can_hold_identifiers_and_holds_name:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the `_convert_key` function should now handle both integer and non-integer indexes and indexers properly. This should make the failing test pass.
