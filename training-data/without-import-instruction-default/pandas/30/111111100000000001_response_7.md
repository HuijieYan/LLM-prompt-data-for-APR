1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is within the `Parser` class, which seems to be part of a larger module for parsing JSON data in pandas.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function could be the handling of the date conversion logic. It seems that the function is attempting to coerce objects into epoch formats and integers/floats into epoch formats and then parse them into date columns.

3. The buggy function is trying to handle conversions for different data types and then convert them into date columns. The potential cause of the bug could be related to the logic for converting data types and parsing them into date columns, as there are multiple try-except blocks and conditions that may not be handling all cases properly. The use of `new_data._values` and `iNaT` also seems to be incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   a. Refactoring the function to handle the different data types more systematically.
   b. Handling the conversions and parsing logic in a more structured manner.
   c. Ensuring that there are proper error handling and exception handling mechanisms in place for all cases.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- The conversion of `new_data` to `int64` is done using `new_data.astype("int64")` instead of `data.astype("int64")`.
- The handling of out-of-range numbers is modified to use `pd.isna` and remove the check for `iNaT`.
- The loop for date units is removed, and `pd.to_datetime` is directly used to convert `new_data`, with error handling in place.
