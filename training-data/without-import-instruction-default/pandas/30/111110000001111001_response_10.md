The issue with the `_try_convert_to_date` method is that it is not handling the pandas data types correctly. The method expects a NumPy ndarray, but in the first test case, it receives a RangeIndex object, and in the second test case, it receives a pandas Series object.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the method works with pandas data types. We can modify the method to handle pandas data types and use pandas functions for date conversion.

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # this is the fixed function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a pandas Series or NumPy ndarray into a date column.
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if data.empty:
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if isinstance(new_data, pd.Series) and new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == pd.NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

        return data, False
```

With this change, the method can handle both pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays, and it uses pandas functions for type conversion and date parsing. This should fix the issues seen in the failing test cases.
