1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the `read_json` function in the pandas library. The GitHub issue details how using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception, which is not the expected behavior. The problem is related to date conversion and the output not being consistent with the "frame" case.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that deals with date conversion. It seems that the function is attempting to convert boolean values into date format, which is causing the unexpected behavior.

3. The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert boolean values into date format. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which describes the unexpected output of timestamps or an exception when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a json list of bools. The function is not handling boolean values correctly and is producing inconsistent results.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding a conditional check to handle boolean values separately from date conversion.
   - Modifying the function to only perform date conversion on specific data types.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False  # do not convert boolean values

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected code will handle boolean values separately and only perform date conversion on the specified data types. This should resolve the issue outlined in the GitHub bug report.
