The main issue in the provided function is that it is incorrectly converting boolean data into date data. This is evident from the GitHub issue description where the expected output is a series of boolean values, but the actual output in older versions of Pandas is in datetime format, and in newer versions it raises a TypeError.

The problematic function is `_try_convert_to_date`, which appears to be an attempt to convert data into date format, but it is also manipulating boolean data in a way that is not intended. The function is trying to handle a variety of date formats and units, but it is not correctly handling boolean data.

To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` should specifically check for boolean data and return it as is, without attempting to convert it into a date format. This can be achieved by adding a condition to handle boolean data separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
            return data, False

        if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False  # return boolean data as is

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle boolean data and return it as is, without attempting to convert it into date format. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
