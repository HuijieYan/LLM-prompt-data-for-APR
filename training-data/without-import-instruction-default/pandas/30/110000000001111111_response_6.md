Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error in the function is that it is attempting to convert boolean values into datetime values, which is not the expected behavior. This is causing the function to return incorrect output.

Bug's cause:
The bug's cause is that the function is not handling boolean values correctly, and is instead attempting to convert them into datetime values, leading to the unexpected output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to check for boolean values and handle them separately, returning a Series of boolean values.
2. Update the function to handle boolean values in a way that is consistent with the expected output.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the issue posted in GitHub:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code will handle boolean values correctly and return a Series of boolean values, satisfying the expected output and resolving the issue posted in the GitHub.
