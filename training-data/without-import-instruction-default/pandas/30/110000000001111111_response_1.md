The buggy function is attempting to parse a ndarray like data into a date column, but it is currently returning incorrect output. The GitHub issue describes a problem with the read_json function when using typ="series" with a list of bools, which results in either an exception or a series of timestamps.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the try-except block where the new_data is being coerced into int64 dtype. This may be causing unwanted behavior when dealing with non-integer data types.

The buggy function's issues in relation to the expected input/output variable information and the GitHub Issue are as follows:
(a). The function is not correctly parsing the input data and returning a boolean if parsing was successful.
(b). The input data is not being properly handled, causing incorrect output.
(c). The GitHub Issue describes a problem with incorrect output from the read_json function when using typ="series" with a list of bools.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to first check the data type and then parse the data accordingly. We can also modify the try-except block to better handle non-integer data types.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_integer_dtype, is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a Series or ndarray-like data into a date column.
    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if is_bool_dtype(new_data):
        return new_data, False

    if is_integer_dtype(new_data):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    try:
        new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

This corrected function first checks if the input data is of boolean type, and if so, returns the input data and False. It then checks if the input data is of integer type, and if so, performs a range check. Finally, it attempts to convert the data to datetime, handling any errors and returning the result.

This function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub Issue by returning a Series of booleans as expected.
