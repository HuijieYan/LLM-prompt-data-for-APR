The issue appears to be that the input data is being incorrectly interpreted as dates when it should be interpreted as boolean values. This results in the function returning a series of timestamps or raising an exception, rather than the expected series of boolean values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of the data to dates without checking if it should be interpreted as boolean values.

The bug's cause is the incorrect interpretation of the input data as dates, leading to unexpected output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking the type of the input data and returning a series of boolean values without attempting to convert to dates.
2. Adding a check to ensure that the input data is correctly interpreted as boolean values rather than being erroneously converted to dates.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function to fix the bug:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected function adds a check to see if the input data is of boolean type, and if so, returns it as is with a flag indicating successful conversion. Otherwise, it returns the original data and a flag indicating unsuccessful conversion.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the function returns a series of boolean values when provided with boolean input data.
