The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class and is responsible for parsing data into a date column.

The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert a boolean value to a datetime, which is causing a TypeError. This suggests that the function is not properly handling boolean values and is attempting to convert them to datetime, which is unnecessary.

The failing test function is `test_readjson_bool_series`, which is trying to read a JSON string that represents a list of boolean values and convert it into a pandas Series. The error message shows that this operation is resulting in a TypeError due to an attempt to convert boolean values to datetime.

The GitHub issue title and description further elaborate that the expected behavior is to obtain a Series of boolean values, but the function is instead converting boolean values to timestamps, resulting in an exception being raised.

To fix this bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be modified to handle boolean values properly and avoid unnecessary conversion to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    # Fixed function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not data.size:  # Use data.size instead of len(data)
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')  # Use pd.to_numeric to convert object to numeric
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            return data, False  # Do not perform any checks or conversions for numeric data

        return new_data, True  # Return the original data if no conversion was needed
```

This corrected version of the function uses `pd.to_numeric` to convert object data to numeric, which includes handling boolean values as well. It also eliminates unnecessary attempts to convert numeric data to datetime, and returns the original data if no conversion is needed. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
