The problem with the current implementation of the _try_convert_to_date function is that it is incorrectly converting non-date data to dates, causing unexpected behavior and errors. The function should only convert data to dates if it is in a valid date format.

The issue reported on GitHub is related to using pd.read_json with typ="series" of a JSON list of bools resulting in timestamps/exceptions instead of a series of boolean values.

The potential error location within the function is in the logic for converting data to dates. It is incorrectly converting non-date data to dates, leading to the unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the _try_convert_to_date function to only convert data to dates if it is in a valid date format, and otherwise return the original data as is.

Here's the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='coerce')
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    return new_data, new_data.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]'
```

This corrected code checks if the data is in a valid date format using the pd.to_datetime function and returns the original data along with a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases provided.
