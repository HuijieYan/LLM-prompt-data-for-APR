The potential error in the provided buggy function lies in the incorrect handling of the 'data' variable. In the first case, 'data' is a RangeIndex and does not require conversion. However, the function attempts to coerce it to int64. In the second case, 'data' is a Series of type bool, and again, it does not require any conversion.

To fix this issue, we need to update the function to handle these data types correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT, Series, RangeIndex

class Parser():
    # corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if isinstance(data, Series):
          # if data is a Series, convert it to datetime
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif isinstance(data, RangeIndex):
          # if data is a RangeIndex, return it as is, as it does not require conversion
            return data, False
        else:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", format="%s")
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        return data, False
```

This corrected function checks the type of the 'data' parameter and handles it accordingly. It returns the original 'data' if it is a RangeIndex, converts it to datetime if it is a Series, and tries to convert it to datetime with a specified format in case of other types of input data.

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information for both Case 1 and Case 2.
