The issue with the _try_convert_to_date function is that it is not handling boolean data correctly. It is attempting to convert boolean data to dates, which is unnecessary and causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix this, we need to add a conditional statement to check if the data type is boolean, and if so, return the data without attempting any date conversion.

Additionally, the function should return the new_data and True if the data conversion is successful. The in_range check is unnecessary and can be removed.

Here is the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    elif data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False
    else:
        new_data = data

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks for boolean data and returns the original data without any conversion. It also correctly returns the new_data and True if the conversion is successful, as expected.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where calling pd.read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools resulted in incorrect output. With this fix, the function will now correctly handle boolean data and return a series of boolean values as expected.
