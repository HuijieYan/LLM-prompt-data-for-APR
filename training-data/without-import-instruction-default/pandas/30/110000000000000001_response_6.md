1. The function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to parse a numpy array-like object into a date column. It tries to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats and returns a boolean if parsing was successful.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if condition `if new_data.dtype == "object":`, and the subsequent try-except block that attempts to convert `new_data` to int64.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the conversion of the data correctly, resulting in potential errors and incorrect parsing of the date.

4. To fix the bug, possible approaches include:
   - Checking the type of data before attempting to convert it
   - Handling the conversion to int64 more robustly
   - Checking for errors in the date conversion and handling them properly

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- The `data` array is properly checked for length and conversion is prevented if it is empty.
- The conversion of `new_data` to int64 is now handled more robustly and potential errors are caught.
- Errors in the date conversion are properly handled in the try-except block.
