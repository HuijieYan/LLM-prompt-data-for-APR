1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used to try to parse a ndarray into a date column. The failing test is related to reading JSON data and converting it into a Series, but it results in a TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `to_datetime` function, which is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, resulting in a TypeError.

3. The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not a valid conversion. This is evident from the failing test, which attempts to read JSON data containing boolean values and convert it to a Series. The error message clearly indicates that the conversion of boolean values to datetime is not possible.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include checking the data type before attempting to convert it to datetime, as well as handling boolean values differently from other data types. Additionally, the logic for converting data to datetime should be revised to handle boolean values appropriately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, an additional check for the "bool" data type is added, and if the data type is boolean, the function returns the original data and False, indicating that the parsing was not successful. This approach handles boolean values differently and prevents the attempt to convert them to datetime.
