1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is a method of the Parser class in the _json.py file of the pandas package. The function is responsible for converting data to a date format, but it has a bug that causes it to return incorrect results or raise errors when processing boolean data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it attempts to convert data to a date format, specifically for boolean data.

3. The bug is caused by the _try_convert_to_date function's inability to correctly handle boolean data, leading to incorrect output or exceptions. This is evident from the GitHub issue description, as well as the fact that the function is intended to handle various data types, including boolean, but it fails to do so effectively.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a) Adding a specific check and conversion process for boolean data within the _try_convert_to_date function.
   (b) Refactoring the function to handle different data types more robustly and accurately.
   (c) Updating the function based on the requirements and expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna, iNaT, _check_for_invalid_keys
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                # Convert boolean data to integer
                if new_data.dtype == np.bool_:
                    new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

The suggested changes include specifically checking for boolean data and converting it to integer before further processing. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
