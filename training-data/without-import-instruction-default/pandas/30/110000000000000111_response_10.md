1. The buggy function is a method that is used to parse a ndarray into a date column. The GitHub issue relates to the problem with the `read_json` function when the `typ` parameter is set to "series" and the input is a JSON list of bools. The function currently tries to convert the input into a datetime format, which causes the error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it tries to convert the input data into datetime format using the `to_datetime` function.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is incorrectly trying to convert the input data into a datetime format, which is not appropriate for the input type (list of bools) provided in the GitHub issue. This causes the TypeError to be raised.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the data type of the input and only attempting to convert to datetime if it is appropriate
   - Handling different data types (such as bools) differently to avoid the TypeError

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class ClassName:  # replacing self with class name
    
    date_unit = None  # assuming this is defined in the class

    min_stamp = pd.Timestamp.min
    
    # corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)  # removed ._values
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)  # removed ._values
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        # handle bools differently
        if new_data.dtype == bool:
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub post by handling bools differently and only attempting to convert to datetime if the data type is appropriate.
