The bug in the function is that the `new_data` variable is not being updated in the right way. It is being assigned the value of `data` at the beginning, but then it is being updated without taking into account the changes made in between. Additionally, the bug is likely in the logic for converting the data to datetime as it is not correctly filtering out values that are out of range.

To fix the bug, the function should update the `new_data` variable properly and fix the logic for filtering out values that are out of range.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # Make a copy of the data to update it properly
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # Update the new_data variable
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            new_data = new_data[in_range]  # Filter out values that are out of range

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function should now work as expected and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
