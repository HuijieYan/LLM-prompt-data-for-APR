1. The buggy function is a part of Pandas library and is related to the GitHub issue because it involves the conversion of data types during the `read_json` operation. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect conversion of boolean values to timestamps, which leads to unexpected behavior when using `typ="series"`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion logic, where it attempts to coerce object types into integer values and then convert them to datetime using the `to_datetime` function.

3. The bug's cause is related to the incorrect handling of boolean values during the conversion process. The `read_json` function should return a Series of boolean values, but due to the conversion logic in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, it results in timestamps or an exception.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Restructuring the conversion logic to handle boolean values separately and ensure that they are correctly parsed as boolean values in the output.
   - Adding validation checks to ensure that the correct data type is being returned based on the input and type specified in the `read_json` operation.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, False  # return the boolean values without conversion

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a specific check for boolean values and returns them without conversion in order to ensure that the `read_json` operation returns a Series of boolean values as expected.
