The issue seems to be related to the `_try_convert_to_date` function in the `Parser` class. The function is attempting to convert data to date format, but it is not handling boolean data correctly, and there are also issues with handling RangeIndex data.

The problem seems to be primarily located within the try-convert-to-date function, as it's responsible for handling the input data and converting it to date format. The function is not correctly identifying boolean data and is not handling RangeIndex data appropriately.

Based on the provided input/output variable information and the GitHub issue, the function is failing to correctly handle boolean data, and there are inconsistencies in the output when dealing with different data types.

To fix this bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Add a conditional check to handle boolean data separately and return the original data without attempting to convert it to date format.
2. Adjust the logic for handling RangeIndex data and ensure that it is not being incorrectly converted to date format.
3. Update the function to handle different data types consistently and return the expected output based on the input data type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False
        
        if isinstance(data, pd.RangeIndex):
            return data, False

        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(new_data) |
                (new_data > self.min_stamp) |
                (new_data == pd.NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected function now handles boolean data and RangeIndex appropriately, ensuring that the function returns the expected output based on the input data type. This solution should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub case.
