1. The buggy function is part of the pandas library and is responsible for parsing a ndarray into a date column. The GitHub issue describes a problem where using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` results in a Pandas Series of timestamps instead of boolean values. The issue also mentions that this behavior is inconsistent with using `typ="frame"`, and has been observed since Pandas version 1.0.0.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic for parsing the data into datetime. It seems that the function is not properly handling boolean values and is converting them into timestamps instead.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function, `_try_convert_to_date`, attempts to parse the input data into datetime values by iterating through different date units and using the `to_datetime` function. 
   (b). The related functions likely include the `to_datetime` function and other numpy and pandas functions for handling data types and conversions.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides a clear description of the problem, indicating that boolean values are being converted into timestamps instead of remaining as boolean values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values separately and return them as is without conversion.
   - Ensuring that the function properly handles different data types and only attempts conversion for valid date formats, excluding boolean values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # Handling boolean values separately
        return data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code handles boolean values separately and returns them without conversion, which should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
