1. The buggy function "_try_convert_to_date" is part of the class Parser in the file pandas/io/json/_json.py. It is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column by coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section where it checks for the date_unit and tries to convert the data to datetime.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the fact that the function is not handling all possible scenarios and exceptions that may occur during the conversion process. The function is also not properly handling the date_unit and conversion to datetime. Additionally, the function is using some undefined variables like "isna" and "iNaT".

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding proper exception handling for all the possible scenarios during the conversion process.
   - Handling the date_unit properly and ensuring it is defined.
   - Using the correct methods and variables for checking the range of numbers and handling NaN values.
   - Importing the necessary libraries and defining any required variables that are currently undefined.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
            
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) 
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the import for numpy is added, and the undefined variables "isna" and "iNaT" are properly used. Exception handling is added for converting the data to int64 and for converting to datetime. Also, "new_data" is properly updated in each iteration of the for loop.
