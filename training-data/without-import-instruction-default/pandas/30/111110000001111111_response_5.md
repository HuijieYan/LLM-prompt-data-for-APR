The buggy function is the `_try_convert_to_date` method within the `Parser` class. From the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem may be related to parsing JSON with `typ="series"` resulting in a Pandas Series of datetime objects instead of boolean values.

Looking at the function's code, it seems that there is an issue with the logic for converting data to a date column. The function first checks if the data type is "object" and tries to convert it to "int64", but then it also checks for numbers that are out of range, which seems contradictory.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values is that the function is returning the input data as is, without converting it to a date column as expected.

To fix this, the function should first check if the input data is already in the expected format (i.e., boolean values) and return it directly. If not, it should attempt to convert the input data to the expected format (i.e., boolean values) and then return it.

The corrected code for the function should look something like this:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, True
        
        if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
            else:
                return new_data.astype(bool), True

        if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                data.isna()
                | (data > self.min_stamp)
            )
            if in_range.all():
                return data.astype(bool), True
        
        return data, False
```

This corrected code should effectively convert the input data to boolean values and return them, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
