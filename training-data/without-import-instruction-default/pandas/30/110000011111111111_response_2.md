The buggy function is the `_try_convert_to_date` function. It is designed to parse an ndarray into a date column, handling different data types and formats. The failing test is trying to read a JSON list of boolean values and convert it into a Pandas Series using the `read_json` function. However, the function is currently trying to convert the boolean values to datetime, which is incorrect.

The error occurs because the `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to convert non-datetime values into datetime, specifically boolean values. This results in a TypeError when trying to convert bool to datetime.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to handle boolean values differently and not attempt to convert them to datetime. Additionally, the function should return the expected output data and type as specified in the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if new_data.dtype == 'bool':
        return new_data, True

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a condition to handle boolean values specifically, returning the data as-is and True for successful parsing. Additionally, it maintains the other parsing conditions as before. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test case.
