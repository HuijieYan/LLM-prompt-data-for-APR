1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is within the class `Parser` and is directly related to the GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception". This issue is due to the function trying to coerce boolean values into timestamps, resulting in unexpected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it tries to coerce the input data into timestamp format, which is not suitable for boolean data.

3. The bug is caused by the function `_try_convert_to_date` trying to convert boolean values to timestamp format instead of handling them as boolean values. This behavior is related to the GitHub issue because it results in the unexpected output of timestamps instead of boolean values.

4. To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` should be modified to handle boolean values separately from date/time conversions. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to identify boolean values and directly return them as they are without attempting any date/time conversions.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, True  # Return the boolean data as it is
        
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
``` 

The corrected code includes a new conditional check to handle boolean values separately and directly return them without attempting date/time conversions. This addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and will result in the expected output of boolean values instead of unexpected timestamps.
