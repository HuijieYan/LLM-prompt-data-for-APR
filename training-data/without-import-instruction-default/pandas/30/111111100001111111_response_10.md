Upon analyzing the provided information, it is apparent that the bug is being caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function within the `Parser` class. The issue is particularly evident in Case 2, where the function is converting boolean values into timestamps, which violates the expected behavior.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of data types within the `_try_convert_to_date` function. In Case 1, the function incorrectly converts a RangeIndex object into a date column, leading to unexpected behavior.

To resolve the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the data types and avoid unnecessary conversions. The logic for checking and converting data types should be revised to ensure that the expected output is obtained.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Adding explicit checks for the data type before performing any conversions
- Handling boolean and date types separately to avoid any conflicts
- Ensuring that the function returns the original data if the conversion is not possible, along with a flag indicating success or failure

Below is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue

    return data, False
```

This corrected code ensures that the function handles different data types appropriately and returns the expected output based on the input parameters. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
