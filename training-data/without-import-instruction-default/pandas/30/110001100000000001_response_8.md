1. The function _try_convert_to_date is designed to try to convert a column of data into a date column. It first checks if the data is empty, then tries to coerce object and numerical data into date formats, and finally attempts to convert the data to datetime using different units. The function depends on the following related functions: isna, to_datetime, and iNaT.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement that checks for numbers out of range and the loop that attempts to convert the data to datetime using different units.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the function may not be correctly handling the conversion of data to datetime using different units. Additionally, the way it checks for numbers out of range may have errors.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the conversion to datetime is being done correctly, potentially by handling the different date units in a more structured way.
   - Checking for numbers out of range using a more robust method to ensure correctness.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the handling of the conversion to datetime has been modified to ensure that it is being done correctly, and the check for numbers out of range has been corrected to ensure correctness.
