The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data into a date column, but the logic is leading to an error when trying to convert boolean values to a datetime object.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible. This aligns with the expected value and type of variables during the failing test execution, where the input parameter is a boolean Series and the function is attempting to convert it to a datetime object.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle boolean data correctly. It is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime objects, which should not be done.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check for the dtype of the input data. If it's a boolean type, it should return the data as is without attempting to convert it to a datetime object. 

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) and new_data.dtype != "bool":
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == pd.iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function handles boolean values and returns the data as is without trying to convert it to a datetime object. It also preserves the behavior of the original function for other data types. This corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
