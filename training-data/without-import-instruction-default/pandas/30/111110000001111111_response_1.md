The issue is with the `_try_convert_to_date` function in the `Parser` class, which is erroneously converting boolean data into date formats. This is causing downstream issues with `read_json` function when the `typ` parameter is set to "series" for JSON lists of bools.

The potential error location within the function is the section where it tries to convert the input data to int64 if the dtype is "object". This is unnecessary for boolean data and is causing the conversion to datetime to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly attempting to convert boolean data to int64, which is not necessary and is leading to the conversion to datetime. This is in direct contradiction to the expected output of a Series of boolean values.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data separately and not attempt any unnecessary conversions. It should return the input data as is, without attempting any datetime conversions.

The corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function is as follows:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        return data, False
    else:
        return data, True
```

With this corrected code, the function will not attempt any unnecessary conversions for boolean data and will return the input data unchanged. This should resolve the issues with the `read_json` function and ensure that a Series of boolean values is returned as expected.
