The problem in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it is incorrectly converting boolean values to datetime, leading to a TypeError when the input is a Series of boolean values.

The failing test is trying to read a JSON string representing a list of boolean values into a pandas Series, but the function is incorrectly converting the boolean values to datetime.

The expected output should be a pandas Series of the same boolean values as the input, rather than a Series of datetime values or an exception.

To fix this bug, we need to handle boolean values as a special case in the `_try_convert_to_date` function and avoid attempting to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series) and data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected function, boolean values will be handled as a special case and returned as a Series of the same boolean values rather than being converted to datetime. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.

This fix addresses the issue described in the GitHub post by ensuring that the read_json function with typ="series" correctly outputs a Series of boolean values rather than an exception or a Series of timestamps.

This fix satisfies the expected input and output variable values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
