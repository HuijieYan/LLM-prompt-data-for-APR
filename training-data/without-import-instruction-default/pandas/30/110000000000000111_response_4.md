1. The buggy function is a method that attempts to convert a given input data into a date format. The GitHub issue mentions a problem with the `read_json` function, which is related to the data conversion issue mentioned in the function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the `new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)` line within the for loop, as this is where the function attempts to convert the data to datetime.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to convert boolean values into datetime values, which is not the expected behavior. This is consistent with the GitHub issue, which mentions that the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` is resulting in datetime values instead of boolean values.

4. To fix the bug, one approach could be to check the data type of the input and return a Series of boolean values instead of trying to convert them to datetime values. This can be done by adding a conditional check for the data type before attempting to convert to datetime.

5. Below is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import isna
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import iNaT
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(data, date_unit, min_stamp):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, True

    date_units = (date_unit,) if date_unit else ('ns',)
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks the data type of the input and returns the input as is if it is of type 'bool', along with a boolean value of True. This satisfies the expected output from the GitHub issue and resolves the bug in the original function.
