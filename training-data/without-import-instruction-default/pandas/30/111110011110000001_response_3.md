1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. The failing test is calling the `read_json` function, which in turn calls the `Parser` class, leading to the execution of the buggy function. The error message shows that a boolean type is being passed to a function that is trying to convert the data to a datetime object.

2. Based on the error message, the potential error location within the problematic function is when it attempts to convert the data to a datetime object using the `to_datetime` function.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is not handling boolean types properly and is trying to convert them to datetime objects, which is not feasible.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the type of the data being processed in the `_try_convert_to_date` function and handle boolean values differently.
   - Add a condition to check for boolean values and handle them separately, potentially by skipping the conversion process for boolean values.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_numeric_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas import iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # this is the fixed function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers and booleans
        if is_numeric_dtype(new_data) or new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, a check for boolean values has been added, and if the data is boolean, the conversion process will be skipped. This should allow the function to handle boolean values properly and pass the failing test.
