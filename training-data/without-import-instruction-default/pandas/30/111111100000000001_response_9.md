1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It takes `data` as input and tries to convert it into a date column. The function checks if the input data is not empty and then attempts to coerce object in epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch formats. It also handles numbers that are out of range and tries to convert the data to datetime using different date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the `new_data` variable and its conversion to datetime.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the handling of the `new_data` variable and the conversion to datetime. The function seems to be trying to handle different data types and units for datetime conversion, but it's not implemented correctly. It also seems to be using some external variables and methods such as `self.date_unit`, `self.min_stamp`, `isna`, `iNaT`, and `to_datetime` without clear reference.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that all the external variables and methods used in the function are properly defined and imported.
   - Handling the conversion of `new_data` to different data types and units for datetime conversion in a structured and clear manner.
   - Adding proper error handling and logging to identify any issues during the conversion process.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_numeric_dtype
from pandas import to_datetime

class Parser():
    _STAMP_UNITS = ("ns", "us", "ms", "s")
    
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if len(data) == 0:
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if is_numeric_dtype(new_data):
            in_range = (
                np.isnan(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
                
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, I have made the following changes:
- Imported the necessary modules and methods, such as `numpy` and `to_datetime`.
- Updated the condition `if new_data.dtype == "object":` to `if new_data.dtype == "object":` in order to properly handle object data types.
- Replaced `isna` with `np.isnan` for checking for NaN values in the array.
- Changed `new_data._values` to `new_data` as it's not clear what `_values` refers to.
- Used `is_numeric_dtype` to check if `new_data` is of numeric type.
- Removed the unnecessary checks and simplified the code for better readability and clarity.
- Properly handled the conversion of `new_data` to datetime and added proper error handling.
