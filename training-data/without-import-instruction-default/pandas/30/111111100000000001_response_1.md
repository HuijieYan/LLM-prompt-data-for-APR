1. The buggy function is a method within the Parser class in the _json.py file of the pandas library. It is supposed to try to convert an input data array into a date column. The function checks if the data is empty, tries to coerce it to an integer if it's of object type, and then attempts to convert it to a datetime object with various date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the try-except block that attempts to coerce the data to an integer if it's of object type.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to the incorrect handling of the data type conversion and the parsing of the date units.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Correctly handling the data type conversion from object type to integer type.
   - Ensuring that the correct date units are used for parsing the date.
   - Improving the error handling to cover all possible scenarios.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, changes have been made to the error handling, data type conversion, and the parsing of date units to ensure that the function behaves as intended without any bugs.
