The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date` within the `Parser` class. It seems that the function is trying to convert data to a date column based on certain conditions, but it is not working as intended. The expected output is a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful, but the function is returning the original data and a boolean instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic for checking the data type and in the conversion steps.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly converting the data to a date column and is not returning the expected boolean value to indicate whether the parsing was successful. This is evident from the expected and actual input/output variable information provided.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Checking the data type more thoroughly and handling conversion accordingly.
2. Changing the return statement to properly return the converted data and a boolean value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code should now properly convert the data to a date column and return a boolean value indicating whether the parsing was successful or not. It should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
