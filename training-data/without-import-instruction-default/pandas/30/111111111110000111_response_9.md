1. The buggy function is _try_convert_to_date, which is part of the Parser class in the _json.py file of the pandas library. The function is responsible for converting data to a date column and is used in the read_json function.

2. The potential error location within the _try_convert_to_date function is the conversion to datetime using the to_datetime function. This is where the TypeError is raised because it cannot convert boolean values to datetime.

3. The bug is caused by the _try_convert_to_date function attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, resulting in a TypeError. The failing test attempts to read a JSON with boolean values and expects the result to be a Pandas Series of booleans. The GitHub issue details this discrepancy, showing that in older Pandas versions, the result is a Series of timestamps, while in newer versions, a TypeError is raised.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the data type of the input and only attempting to convert to datetime if it is compatible (e.g., not a boolean).
   - Modifying the _try_convert_to_date function to handle boolean values separately and return a Series of booleans instead of attempting to convert them to datetime.

5. Here is the corrected code for the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        # Check if the data is of boolean type
        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        # Check if the data is of object type
        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

            # ignore numbers that are out of range
            if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
                in_range = (
                    isna(new_data._values)
                    | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                    | (new_data._values == iNaT)
                )
                if not in_range.all():
                    return data, False

            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
                return new_data, True
            return data, False
        else:
            return data, False
```

This corrected code checks the data type at the beginning and returns early if the data is of boolean type. Then it proceeds with the conversion to datetime based on the data type. This code should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
