1. The buggy function is a method of the Parser class. It is attempting to convert data into a date column using various methods, such as coercion of object types into integer, checking for numbers out of range, and converting to datetime using different date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the handling of different data types and the conversion to datetime.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to convert data into a date column but does not handle all possible data types and exceptions that may occur during the conversion process.
   (b). The buggy class may not be handling the datetime conversion and data type checks correctly, leading to the buggy behavior of the function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Handle different data types and conversions more robustly, using explicit checks for different types and handling exceptions.
   - Ensure that the datetime conversion is properly handled with appropriate error checking and handling.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

class Parser():
    # Fixed function to convert data to date column
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats.
        Return a boolean indicating if parsing was successful.
        """
        if len(data) == 0:  # no conversion on empty
            return data, False

        new_data = data.copy()
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
                if new_data.notnull().all():
                    return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- Proper error handling and exception handling is added, with specific error types being captured and handled appropriately.
- The new_data variable is now explicitly copied to avoid modifying the original data.
- The datetime conversion uses "coerce" for errors to handle conversion errors more gracefully.
- The function now checks if the converted data is not null before returning it, ensuring that the conversion was successful.
