The buggy function is _try_convert_to_date(self, data), part of the Parser class in the _json.py file of the pandas library. The function seems to be responsible for converting data into a date column, but it is currently causing a TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime.

The cause of the bug is likely the attempt to convert boolean values to datetime within the _try_convert_to_date function. This behavior is not desirable, as the input data is a list of boolean values and should be converted to a Series of boolean values.

To fix the bug, the _try_convert_to_date function needs to handle boolean values correctly and return a Series of boolean values when the input data is a list of booleans.

Here is the corrected version of the _try_convert_to_date function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        try:
            # Attempt to parse the input data as datetime
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data)
            result = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            # If the parsing fails, return the original data and False
            new_data = pd.Series(data)
            result = False

        return new_data, result
```

With this correction, the _try_convert_to_date function will correctly handle boolean values and return a Series of boolean values when the input is a list of booleans. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and also pas the failing test.
