1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is being called when trying to parse a JSON list of bools using `pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")`. The function is attempting to convert the bool values into datetime objects, which is not the expected behavior.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the logic that checks the data type and attempts to convert it to `int64`. This conversion is unnecessary for parsing bool values and is causing the unexpected behavior.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly attempts to convert bool values into datetime objects, which is causing the TypeError when attempting to read a JSON list of bools as a series.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Removing the unnecessary conversion to `int64` for bool values.
   (b). Adding a specific condition to handle bool values and not attempt to convert them to datetime objects.
   (c). Ensuring that the function doesn't attempt to parse non-date data types as date objects.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
   
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) or new_data.dtype == bool:
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the `_try_convert_to_date` function will correctly handle bool values and avoid attempting to convert them to datetime objects. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
