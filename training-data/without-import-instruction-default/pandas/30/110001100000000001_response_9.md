1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is attempting to convert data into a date column by parsing an ndarray. It first tries to coerce the data into int64 format, and then checks for numbers that are out of range. It also attempts to convert the data into a datetime format using various date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the conversion of the data into int64 format without handling exceptions properly, and the check for numbers that are out of range might not be functioning as expected.

3. The bug's cause could be due to improper handling of exceptions during the conversion to int64 format, and the comparison for numbers that are out of range may not be accurate. Additionally, the function to_datetime may be failing to handle certain cases properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Properly handling exceptions during the conversion to int64 format
   - Reviewing the logic for checking numbers that are out of range
   - Ensuring that the to_datetime function is handling all cases accurately

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data <= self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code, changes have been made to properly handle exceptions during the conversion to int64 format, fix the logic for checking numbers that are out of range, and ensure that the to_datetime function is handling all cases accurately.
