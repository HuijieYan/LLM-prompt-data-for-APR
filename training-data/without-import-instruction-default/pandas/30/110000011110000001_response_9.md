1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used in the context of reading JSON data. The test function "test_readjson_bool_series" is testing the functionality of reading JSON data where the string values "true" and "false" should be converted to boolean types. The error message indicates that the conversion to datetime is failing, which is unexpected as the input data is a boolean series.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the conversion to datetime using the "to_datetime" function, as the error message explicitly states that a boolean type is not convertible to datetime.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is attempting to convert boolean values to a datetime object, which is incorrect. This is causing a TypeError to be raised, as seen in the error message.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding a condition to check if the input data consists of boolean types and skipping the datetime conversion in such cases. Another approach could be to modify the dataframe values before the datetime conversion, ensuring that they are appropriate for conversion to datetime.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, True

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
``` 

By adding a condition to check for boolean types and returning them with a status of True, the function now handles boolean values correctly without attempting the datetime conversion, effectively addressing the bug.
