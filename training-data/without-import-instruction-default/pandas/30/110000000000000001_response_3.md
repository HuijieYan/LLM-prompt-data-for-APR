1. The buggy function is trying to parse a ndarray into a date column by coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. It also checks if the numbers are in range and then tries to convert to datetime with different units. However, there are potential errors in the function which are causing it to not work properly.

2. The potential error location is in the part where it tries to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats, as well as in the part where it checks if the numbers are in range.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the data transformation and conversion properly, which could lead to incorrect parsing and conversions of the data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Ensure that the data types are handled correctly and coerced to the intended formats.
   b. Check for out of range numbers and handle them appropriately.
   c. Ensure that the date units are being used properly for conversion to datetime.

5. The corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if isinstance(data, np.ndarray):
        new_data = data.copy()
        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
    else:
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- The input data is copied to a new variable to avoid modifying the original data.
- Type checking is added to handle ndarray inputs.
- Conversion of object data to "int64" is done on the copied data.
- Type checking for numbers is moved after the object conversion.
- Date unit handling and conversion to datetime is kept the same but the try-except block is improved.

These changes will help fix the potential errors and ensure proper handling of data transformation and conversion in the function.
