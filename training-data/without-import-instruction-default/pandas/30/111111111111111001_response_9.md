The issue in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be caused by the fact that it's trying to convert non-datetime objects into datetime objects without proper checks. This is evident from the error message in the failing test, which indicates that a boolean value is being treated as if it should be convertible to a datetime.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function does not try to convert non-datetime objects into datetime objects.

One possible way to approach this is to add a condition to check the data type before trying to convert to datetime. If the data type is not suitable for conversion, we should return the original data and `False` indicating that the conversion was not successful. We also need to ensure that the `isna` function is properly defined and imported, as it is used in the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.missing import iNaT
from pandas._libs.missing import isna
from pandas import to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
            else:
                data = new_data

        if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(data) | (data > self.min_stamp) | (data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        else:
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
           try:
               new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
           except (ValueError, OverflowError):
               continue
           return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this corrected function, it should now handle the conversion to datetime properly, taking into account different data types and preventing the conversion of non-datetime objects into datetime objects.
