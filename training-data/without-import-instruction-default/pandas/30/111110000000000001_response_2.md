1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class and is named _try_convert_to_date. It is intended to parse a ndarray into a date column. The function first checks the length of the data and returns the data if it is empty. Then it attempts to convert the data to int64 if its dtype is "object". After that, it checks for numbers that are out of range and attempts to convert the data to datetime using different date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the try-except block where it attempts to convert data to int64 if its dtype is "object".

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the handling of data conversion to int64 within the try-except block. The function may not be handling the conversion properly, leading to an error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding proper error handling within the try-except block to catch any errors during the data conversion to int64.
   - Checking the input data and ensuring that it is in the expected format before attempting to convert it to int64.
   - Reviewing the entire function and making sure that the logic for data conversion and parsing to datetime is sound.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna, iNaT

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the error has been fixed by changing the line `new_data = data.astype("int64")` to `new_data = new_data.astype("int64")`, ensuring that the correct variable is being updated. Additionally, the logic for handling errors during the int64 conversion has been improved to catch relevant exceptions.
