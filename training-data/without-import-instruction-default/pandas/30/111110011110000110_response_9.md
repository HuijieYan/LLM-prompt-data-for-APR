```python
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        # Return a boolean if parsing was successful
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
```

The changes made to the function include:
1. Added an explicit check for boolean data type to return False immediately, as boolean cannot be converted to datetime.
2. Simplified the code to use `pd.to_datetime` directly.

These changes should address the issue where converting a boolean into a datetime was causing a TypeError and incorrect output.

The corrected function now handles the conversion of data to datetime and returns a boolean flag indicating if the conversion was successful.
