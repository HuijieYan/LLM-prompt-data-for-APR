1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It attempts to parse a ndarray into a date column and coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. The potential error location seems to be in the handling of date conversion and the conditions for checking if the date is in range.

2. The potential error may be due to incorrect handling of date conversion and the condition for checking if the date is in range. Additionally, it seems that the function is using some external variables such as `isna`, `np.number`, `to_datetime` without clearly defined definitions within the given code. 

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the conversion to date and the conditions for checking if the date is in range. 
   (b). The `Parser` class itself may have missing or incorrect implementations of related functions.
   (c). The use of external variables such as `isna`, `np.number`, `to_datetime` without defined definitions within the code could also be causing issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Clearly define and implement the missing or related functions within the `Parser` class.
   (b). Ensure that the date conversion and range checking conditions are correctly implemented.
   (c). Make sure that any external variables used in the function are properly defined or imported.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

class Parser():
    # ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/ISO formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if len(data) == 0:
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
            
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                np.isnat(new_data) 
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp) 
                | (new_data == np.iinfo(new_data.dtype).max)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
            
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we made the following changes:
- Used `np` namespace for `isnan` and `iinfo` functions instead of the undefined `isna` and `iNaT`.
- Corrected the condition for checking if the date is in range using `np.isnat`, `np.iinfo`, and `np.max`.
- Used `pd.to_datetime` instead of `to_datetime` assuming it refers to the `pandas` library.
