1. The buggy function is trying to convert a ndarray into a date column and returns a boolean value based on whether the parsing was successful or not.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for checking if the data is within range and in the loop for trying to convert the data to datetime.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking if the data is within range may not be working as intended, and the loop for trying to convert the data to datetime may not be handling errors properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use proper error handling for converting data to datetime and checking if the data is within range.
   - Check for any missing dependencies or libraries that may be causing issues with the conversion and data checking.

5. The corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the conversion of `data` to `int64` has been fixed where `new_data = new_data.astype("int64")` and the error handling for converting to datetime has been updated in the loop, followed by returning the new_data and success as a boolean value. Additionally, corrected usage for checking the length of the array by using `len(data)` instead of `not len(data)`.
