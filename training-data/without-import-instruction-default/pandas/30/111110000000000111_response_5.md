1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the class `Parser`. The GitHub issue is related to `read_json` with `typ="series"` resulting in timestamps/Exception instead of a series of boolean values. The issue arises in older Pandas versions, where the code results in a Pandas Series object with timestamps instead of boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the date conversion logic, where the function is attempting to convert the data to date units even when it is expected to be a series of boolean values.

3. (a). The buggy function is attempting to convert input data into date units.
   (b). The class containing the buggy function is not handling the data type conversion correctly, leading to the unexpected output in the GitHub issue.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides specific examples of the problem, including the expected and actual outputs, as well as the version of Pandas installed.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Identify the data type of the input and handle the conversion accordingly. For boolean input, return the input as is without attempting to convert to date units.
   - Add error handling for boolean input to prevent the function from trying to convert it to date units.
   - Check for the version of Pandas being used and handle the conversion differently based on the version.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():
    
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.
        
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":  # Handling boolean input
            return new_data, False
        
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

The corrected code includes a specific check for boolean input, returning the input as is without attempting to convert it to date units. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
