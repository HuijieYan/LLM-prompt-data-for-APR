1. The buggy function is inside the Parser class in the pandas/io/json/_json.py file. The function is meant to parse a ndarray-like data into a date column, coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. The related function for this issue is pd.read_json, which is used to read a JSON file into a pandas dataframe or series. The GitHub issue suggests that when using pd.read_json with typ="series" of a JSON list of bools, it results in timestamps/exceptions, instead of a series of bools.

2. The potential error in the buggy function seems to be the date parsing logic, where it is attempting to convert the data into a date format even if the data is of type bool.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function, _try_convert_to_date, is responsible for type conversion of data to date formats.
   (b). The Parser class contains the _try_convert_to_date function and is related to JSON parsing and type conversion.
   (c). The related functions are the ones responsible for reading JSON data into a pandas dataframe or series, such as pd.read_json.
   (d). The GitHub issue information indicates that when using pd.read_json with typ="series" of a JSON list of bools, it results in timestamps/exceptions instead of a series of bools. This suggests that the _try_convert_to_date function may be incorrectly converting boolean data into timestamps.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check the data type before attempting to convert it to a date format. If the data is boolean, it should not be converted.
   (b). Handle boolean data separately to ensure it is not processed as date data.
   (c). Ensure that the conversion logic only applies to data that can be converted to date formats, and handle boolean data appropriately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for the data type, and if the data is of type bool, the function immediately returns the original data with a boolean flag set to False, indicating that the parsing was not successful. This ensures that boolean data is not processed as date data, thereby fixing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
