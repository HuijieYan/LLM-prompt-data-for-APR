The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` has a couple of issues. The main problem is that it is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not possible. This is causing a TypeError to be raised when trying to convert the boolean values to datetime.

Since the function is supposed to try to parse an ndarray into a date column, it should not attempt to convert boolean values to datetime.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the data type is boolean and return the original data along with a False boolean value for indicating that the parsing was not successful. This will ensure that boolean values are not attempted to be converted to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import iNaT
from pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime import NaT as iNaT
from pandas.api.types import isna
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import Timestamp, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == bool:  # Check for boolean type
            return data, False  # Return original data and False for unsuccessful parsing
        
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False

# Run the failing test to ensure the correction works
def test_readjson_bool_series():
    # GH31464
    result = read_json("[true, true, false]", typ="series")
    expected = pd.Series([True, True, False])
    tm.assert_series_equal(result, expected)
```

This corrected code will now successfully handle boolean values, and when run with the failing test, it should no longer raise a TypeError and should pass the test with the expected output.
