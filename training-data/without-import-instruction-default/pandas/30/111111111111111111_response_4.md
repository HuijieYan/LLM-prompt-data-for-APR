The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it attempts to convert boolean values to date, which raises a TypeError. This is not the expected behavior, as the input is a Series of boolean values and the output should be a Series of the same boolean values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values correctly and return them as is.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if not issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            return data, False

        return new_data, True
```

With this corrected code, the function will return the input data unchanged in the case of boolean values, and the failing tests should now pass.

This fix will also address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report, by ensuring that the function returns a Series of boolean values as expected.
