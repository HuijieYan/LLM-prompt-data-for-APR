1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class and it is trying to convert data into a date column. It uses a try-except block to handle potential errors when converting data. The function checks if the data is empty, attempts to convert it to int64 if it is an object, and then checks if the numbers are within a certain range before attempting to convert them to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the in_range variable and the subsequent return statements.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect handling of the in_range variable and the return statements within the for loop. The function might not be able to correctly return the new_data and the boolean value indicating whether the parsing was successful.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check the logic for handling in_range and returning the correct values.
   b. Ensure that the correct values are being returned when the parsing is successful or unsuccessful.
   c. Consider refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.errors import iNaT
from pandas import isna, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return new_data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- Changed `data.astype("int64")` to `new_data.astype("int64")` to ensure that the correct variable is being used.
- Changed `new_data._values` to `new_data` in the in_range calculation.
- Moved the return statement within the for loop to ensure that the correct values are returned when parsing is successful.
