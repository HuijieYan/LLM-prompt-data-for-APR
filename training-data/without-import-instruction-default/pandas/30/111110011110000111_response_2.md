The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to convert data to a date format, but it is failing when it encounters boolean values. This is causing the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.

The issue seems to be with the `to_datetime` function, which is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime.

To fix the bug, we can update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values differently and return a boolean series without attempting conversion to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser:
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        else:
            new_data = data

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            return data, False

        return new_data, False
```

With this updated code, the `read_json` function should now be able to handle boolean series without raising a TypeError.
