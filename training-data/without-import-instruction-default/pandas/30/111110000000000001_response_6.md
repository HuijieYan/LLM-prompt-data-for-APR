1. The buggy function is a method within the Parser class. It is designed to parse an ndarray into a date column, trying to convert different formats into a date format and returning a boolean if the parsing was successful.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the handling of different data types and the conversion to date.

3. The buggy function has a few potential causes of error:
   (a) It attempts to convert the data into int64 without considering all possible object types.
   (b) It checks for numbers that are out of range but does not handle it properly.
   (c) The use of date_unit and the try-except block for converting to datetime seems to have issues as well.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Check for all possible object types and handle conversions properly.
   (b) Handle out of range numbers effectively to avoid issues.
   (c) Revise the logic for converting to datetime and handle the exceptions properly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime, isna

class Parser():
    date_unit = "s"
    min_stamp = 0
    iNaT = np.datetime64("NaT")

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray into a date column.

        Try to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors="coerce")
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                np.isnan(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == self.iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- Changed `astype("int64")` to `pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors="coerce")` to handle different object types.
- Used `np.isnan()` instead of `isna()` to handle out of range numbers effectively.
- Modified the try-except block for converting to datetime using `to_datetime` and handled errors with `errors="coerce"`.
