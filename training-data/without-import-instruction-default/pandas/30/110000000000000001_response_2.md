1. The buggy function is a method that attempts to convert a ndarray into a date column by parsing it into various date formats. The function checks for empty data, attempts to convert object datatype to int64, ignores numbers out of range, and then tries to convert the data to datetime using different date units.

2. The potential error locations in the function could be the logic for checking if the data is empty, the conversion of object datatype to int64, and the handling of numbers out of range.

3. The bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of the different data types and the conditions for parsing the data into datetime.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:

- Correctly handling the conversion of object datatype to int64, including proper error handling.
- Properly handling numbers that are out of range, and updating the condition for checking if the data is empty.
- Ensuring that the conversion to datetime is done consistently and accurately using the appropriate date units and error handling.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue

    return data, False
```
The corrected code fixes the potential error locations and ensures proper handling of the different data types and conversion to datetime.
