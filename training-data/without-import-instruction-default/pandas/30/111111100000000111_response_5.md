1. The buggy function "_try_convert_to_date" is part of the Parser class in the json module of the pandas library. The function is responsible for converting data into a date column in the case of parsing a ndarray. The GitHub issue describes a problem where using pd.read_json with typ="series" results in the generation of timestamps or an exception, instead of a Series of boolean values.

2. The potential error location within the function is the logic for converting the data to a date format. It seems that the function is not handling boolean values properly and is attempting to convert them to a date format, leading to the incorrect output.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to convert the data to a date format, but it does not handle boolean values correctly.
   (b). The Parser class is responsible for parsing JSON data, and the function is related to the conversion of data to date format.
   (c). Related functions include the logic for parsing different data types and converting them to the appropriate format.
   (d). The GitHub issue provides an example of the problem and the expected output, along with the system and library versions being used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a condition to check for boolean values and handle them appropriately, possibly by returning the unchanged data as a Series of boolean values.
   - Ensure that the function correctly identifies the data type and performs the conversion only when necessary.
   - Update the logic for parsing different data types to handle boolean values separately.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
The corrected code includes a check for boolean values and returns the unchanged data as a Series of boolean values. This should address the issue outlined in the GitHub bug report.
