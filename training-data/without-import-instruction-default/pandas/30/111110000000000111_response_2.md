1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class. The GitHub issue is related to a problem with `pd.read_json` when using `typ="series"`. The issue is a TypeError that occurs when trying to convert boolean values to datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of boolean values to datetime.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the function attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not a valid conversion. This is evident from the GitHub issue description where users are expecting a series of bools but getting a series of timestamps instead. 

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include: 
   (a). Checking the input data type and handling boolean values differently 
   (b). Adding a condition to check if the input data contains boolean values and returning it as is without attempting to convert to datetime 
   (c). Handling the conversion error for boolean values separately from other data types

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        # If the data type is boolean, return it as is
        return data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes a new condition to handle boolean values separately and return them as is. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
