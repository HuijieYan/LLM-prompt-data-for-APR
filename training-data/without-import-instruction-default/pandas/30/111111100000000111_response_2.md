1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the Parser class in the pandas/io/json/_json.py file. It is used to parse a ndarray-like data into a date column, trying to coerce objects into epoch/iso formats and integer/float into epoch formats. The GitHub issue is related to the `read_json` function with the `typ="series"` parameter, which should result in a Pandas Series of bools but is instead returning a Series of timestamps or throwing an exception.

2. The potential error location within the `_try_convert_to_date` function is likely in the logic for parsing the data and converting it to a date column, as this is the process that should be resulting in the incorrect output.

3. The bug's cause is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is converting the input data into date columns, regardless of the data type. This results in unexpected behavior when the input data is a boolean type, as seen in the GitHub issue. The function does not properly handle boolean data and is coercing it into a date format, resulting in incorrect output.

4. To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be modified to properly handle boolean data and prevent it from being converted into a date format. This can involve adding an explicit check for boolean data and returning the original data without conversion in such cases.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # other class methods...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            if new_data.dtype == "bool":  # Check for boolean data
                return data, False  # Return original data and indicate parsing was not successful

            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, a specific check for boolean data is added, and if the input data is boolean, the original data is returned without conversion, and parsing is indicated as not successful. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to the `read_json` function outputting unexpected data when using the typ="series" parameter.
