The buggy function in the `Parser` class is the `_try_convert_to_date` method. The issue is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of boolean data to date format. This is causing the Pandas `read_json` function to raise a TypeError when parsing boolean data with `typ="series"`.

The problem seems to be in the attempt to convert boolean data to date format, which is not a valid conversion. This is evident from the input and output information provided, as well as the GitHub issue, which mentions the unexpected conversion of boolean values to timestamps.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle boolean data as a separate case and not attempt to convert it to date format. Additionally, the function should return the correct value and type of variables as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif is_bool_dtype(new_data.dtype):
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code handles boolean data as a separate case and returns the expected values and types of variables. It should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
