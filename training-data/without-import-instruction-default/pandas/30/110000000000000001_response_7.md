1. The buggy function is attempting to convert input data into a date column and return a boolean indicating whether the conversion was successful or not. The function checks if the input data is of dtype "object" and attempts to convert it to "int64". It then checks if the data is within a certain range, and finally attempts to convert it to datetime using the to_datetime function. However, there are potential issues in the code that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error locations in the function are:
   - The conversion of data to "int64" may not be successful for all types of data.
   - The check for data within a certain range might not be handling invalid data properly.
   - The conversion to datetime might encounter errors due to invalid input data.

3. The cause of the bug could be:
   (a). Incorrect handling of data types during conversion to "int64".
   (b). Improper handling of data range checking.
   (c). Errors in the conversion to datetime due to invalid input data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Use a more robust method for converting data to "int64" that can handle different types of data.
   (b). Check the data range in a more structured manner to handle invalid data properly.
   (c). Add proper error handling and validation for the input data before attempting to convert it to datetime.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, to_datetime, iNaT

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    in_range = (
        isna(new_data) |
        (new_data > self.min_stamp) |
        (new_data == iNaT)
    )

    if not in_range.all():
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else ('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns', 'ps', 'fs', 'as')
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue

    return data, False
```
In the corrected code:
- We are using `pd.to_numeric()` to coerce the object into epoch formats.
- The check for numbers that are out of range has been updated to handle invalid data properly.
- Proper error handling has been added for the conversion to datetime.
