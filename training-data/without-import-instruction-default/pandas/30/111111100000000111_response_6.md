1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is part of the Parser class in the pandas/io/json/_json.py file. It is used to parse a ndarray into a date column and tries to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. The GitHub issue suggests that when using pd.read_json with typ="series" of a JSON list of bools, it results in timestamps/Exception, instead of a series of bools.

2. Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the logic of parsing the data into a date column, which is resulting in timestamps instead of bools.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The _try_convert_to_date function tries to convert the data to datetime without considering the datatype of the data.
   (b). The Parser class might not be handling bool values correctly when parsing them to a date column.
   (c). The related function pd.read_json is failing to return a Series of bools when typ="series" is used with a JSON list of bools.
   (d). The GitHub issue information shows that the expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Check the datatype of the input data and handle bool values differently to prevent them from being parsed as timestamps.
   (b). Modify the logic in _try_convert_to_date to handle bool values separately and not try to convert them to datetime.
   (c). Update the behavior of pd.read_json when typ="series" is used with bool values to return a Series of bools instead of timestamps.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():
    # This is the corrected function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if is_bool_dtype(data):  # Check if the data is of type bool
            return data, True  # If it's a boolean, return the data and True

        # Handle other data types
        if len(data) == 0:  # No conversion on empty
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                np.isnan(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == pd.NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
This corrected function first checks if the data is of type bool, and if so, it returns the data and True, indicating that the parsing was successful. Otherwise, it follows the original logic for handling other data types. This should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
