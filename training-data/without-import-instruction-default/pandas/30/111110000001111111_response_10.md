The problem seems to be related to the `_try_convert_to_date` method of the Parser class. The method is intended to convert input data into a date format, but it seems to be incorrectly converting boolean values and causing issues.

Based on the runtime and expected values, it seems like the problem lies in the part of the function where it checks for the data type and tries to convert it to `int64`. This is unnecessary for boolean and RangeIndex data types.

A possible approach to fix the bug would be to add a condition to check for boolean and RangeIndex data types and handle them differently. For example, if the data type is boolean, it should skip the datetime conversion process altogether.

Additionally, it seems like the function is missing necessary imports for the numpy and pandas libraries. These should be added at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` method:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if is_bool_dtype(data):
            return data, False

        if isinstance(data, pd.RangeIndex):
            return data, False

        if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                pd.isna(data._values) 
                | (data > self.min_stamp) 
                | (data._values == pd.NaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue

        return data, False
```

This corrected code should handle boolean and RangeIndex data differently, and also include necessary imports for pandas and numpy. It should address the issue described in the GitHub post and provide the expected output.
