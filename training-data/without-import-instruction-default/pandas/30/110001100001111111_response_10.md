The bug in the provided function appears to be related to the conversion of data to date columns. It seems to be incorrectly interpreting boolean data as dates, resulting in unexpected behavior when reading JSON files. This issue is also reflected in the GitHub issue title and description.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of boolean data. It incorrectly tries to convert boolean data into timestamps, leading to the unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug can be identified by looking at the function's logic. It incorrectly treats boolean data as potential date data, which is not the expected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking the data type before attempting to convert it to date columns.
2. Implementing a specific handling for boolean data to prevent it from being converted to timestamps.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        if new_data.dtype == "int64":
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')

    # check if the data type is boolean, and handle it accordingly
    if new_data.dtype == 'bool':
        return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code should prevent boolean data from being mistakenly converted to timestamps, resolving the issue described in the GitHub issue.
