1. The buggy function _try_convert_to_date is defined within the class Parser in the file pandas/io/json/_json.py. The function is responsible for parsing a ndarray into a date column. The function seems to have issues when attempting to convert boolean values into timestamps.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the if condition checking for an object type and trying to convert it to int64, as well as the conversion to datetime.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the conversion of boolean values into timestamps, causing an inconsistency in the expected output. The GitHub issue details the problem with pd.read_json when typ="series" is used, and the resulting Pandas Series object containing timestamps instead of boolean values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Modifying the _try_convert_to_date function to handle boolean values differently, ensuring that they are not converted to timestamps.
   - Implementing a check for boolean values and treating them as such without attempting to convert them to timestamps.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False  # Prevent boolean values from being converted

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code adds a condition to check if the data type is boolean, and if so, returns the original data and a False flag to prevent the conversion of boolean values to timestamps. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
