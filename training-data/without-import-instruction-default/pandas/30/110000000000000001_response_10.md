1. The buggy function is supposed to try to parse ndarray data into a date column and return a boolean if parsing was successful. It checks for various conditions such as empty data, data type, range of numbers, and attempts to convert the data into a datetime format.

2. The potential error location within the function could be in the handling of data type conversion and the check for numbers out of range.

3. The potential bug in the function is that it doesn't handle the conversion of data to datetime properly, and the conditions for checking the range of numbers may not be implemented correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be:
   a. Proper handling of data type conversion and error handling.
   b. Correctly checking and handling the range of numbers.
   c. Ensuring that the function returns the correct boolean value indicating the success of parsing.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the handling of data type conversion and error handling is improved. The conditions for checking the range of numbers are also modified to ensure proper handling. The function now returns the correct boolean value indicating the success of parsing.
