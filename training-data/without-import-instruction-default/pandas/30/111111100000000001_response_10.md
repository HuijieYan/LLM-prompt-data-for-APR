1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class. It is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column by coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. The function checks for empty input and attempts to convert object data types into int64. It then checks for numbers that are out of range, and finally tries to convert the data into date units.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of date units and the conversion of data types.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the incorrect handling of the data types and date units. The function is trying to convert the data directly into date units without adequately handling potential errors during conversion. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in the output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Adding more robust error handling during data type conversion and date unit conversion.
   - Ensuring that the input data is properly validated before attempting any conversions.
   - Checking for edge cases and handling them appropriately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    # this is the fixed function
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if len(data) == 0:
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = [self.date_unit] if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue

        return data, False
```
In the corrected code, we have made the following changes:
- Added a check for an empty input array using `len(data) == 0`.
- Modified the `date_units` assignment to handle a single date unit when `self.date_unit` is not None.
- Modified the error handling in the `to_datetime` function by using `errors="coerce"` to handle errors by setting invalid parsing results to NaT. This ensures that the function does not raise an error and continues processing other date units.
