The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition `if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number)` and the subsequent check for `in_range`. It seems that the intent of the code is to check if the data type is a number and then perform a comparison based on the range defined by `self.min_stamp`. However, there are some issues with the logic which cause it to return incorrect results.

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of RangeIndex and dtype. In the first case, the dtype of `new_data` is incorrectly set to "int64", which results in incorrect comparison. In the second case, the dtype of the Series `new_data` is correctly set to "bool", but there is no proper handling of the data dtype.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the data type is handled and correctly compare them in the condition.

Possible approches to fix this bug include:
1. Check for the data type of the input and handle it accordingly.
2. Use proper comparisons based on the data type to check if the data is in the specified range.
3. Return the correct values based on the comparisons made.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if str(new_data.dtype) == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(data._values)
                | (data < self.min_stamp)
                | (data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```
