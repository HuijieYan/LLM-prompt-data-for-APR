1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to parse an ndarray into a date column. It does this by attempting to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integers/floats in epoch formats. The function also checks if the data is within a certain range and then converts it to a datetime if it is within range.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `new_data` variable, where it is being reassigned and modified without proper checks.

3. The potential bug's cause may be due to mishandling of the `new_data` variable. The function tries to convert the data to int64 if the dtype is "object", but it does not handle this case properly. Additionally, the check for numbers that are out of range does not seem to be functioning as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add proper error handling for the conversion of data to int64.
   - Ensure that the check for numbers within range is accurate and returns the expected result.
   - Refactor the function to improve readability and maintainability.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """

    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False
    
    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="coerce")
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
    else:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, unit=self.date_unit, errors="coerce")
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
    
    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.notnull(new_data) & (new_data >= self.min_stamp) & (new_data != pd.NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

In the corrected code, the function uses `pd.to_datetime` to parse the data into a date column, and proper error handling is implemented. The checks for numbers within range also use `pd.notnull` and `pd.NaT` to ensure accurate results.
