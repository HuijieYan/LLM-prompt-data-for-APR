The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it is incorrectly converting boolean values into dates. This is consistent with the GitHub issue title and description, which mentions that using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of JSON list of bools results in timestamps/exceptions.

The potential error location within the function is the section that attempts to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats. It then tries to convert the data to datetime, but the logic is flawed, leading to the unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly interpreting boolean data as if it were datetime data. This leads to the conversion of boolean values into timestamps, causing the unexpected behavior seen in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function needs to first check if the data is boolean, and if so, return it as is without attempting any datetime conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function that satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == pd.NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected code checks if the data is of type "bool" and returns it as is. This resolves the issue of boolean values being converted into timestamps or causing exceptions. It also satisfies the expected input/output variable information and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub issue.
