1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file. This function is responsible for converting data to a date column. The failing test is attempting to read a JSON string containing boolean values and convert it to a Pandas Series, but it is currently resulting in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function can be identified in the section where it attempts to convert the data to a datetime object using the `to_datetime` function.

3. (a). The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to convert the data to a datetime object, which results in a TypeError when boolean values are encountered.
(b). The `Parser` class contains the `_try_convert_to_date` function and is responsible for parsing JSON data.
(c). The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is attempting to read a JSON string containing boolean values and convert it into a Pandas Series. The error message indicates that a boolean value is not convertible to datetime.
(d). The failing test is indicating a TypeError occurring at the line `result = read_json("[true, true, false]", typ="series")`. The error message indicates that a boolean value is not convertible to datetime.
(e). The GitHub issue provides a description of the problem, an example of the failing code, and the expected output, as well as the versions of Pandas, Python, and related libraries being used.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the data type before attempting to convert it to a datetime object.
   - Handling different data types (including boolean) to ensure that a Pandas Series of the correct data type is returned.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        if not isinstance(data, pd.Series):
            data = pd.Series(data)  # Convert to Pandas Series if not already
        
        if data.dtype == "object":
            if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(data):
                try:
                    return pd.to_datetime(data, errors='coerce'), True
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    return data, False
        
        return data, False
```
This updated version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function should handle the conversion of boolean values to a Pandas Series without causing a TypeError. It first checks if the input data is already a Pandas Series, and if not, it converts it. Then, it checks if the data type is object, and if it is a numeric type, it attempts to convert it to datetime using the `pd.to_datetime` function with error handling. This approach addresses the issue described in the GitHub report and should also pass the failing test.
