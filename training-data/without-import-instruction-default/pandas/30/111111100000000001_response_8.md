1. The buggy function is a method called `_try_convert_to_date` within the `Parser` class. It attempts to parse an ndarray into a date column, coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic used to check the range of numbers and the handling of different date units.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not handle the conversion of data to date format properly. It also does not handle the logic for checking the range of numbers and date units.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Handle the conversion of data to date format using appropriate methods.
   b. Review the logic for checking the range of numbers and handle it more accurately.
   c. Ensure that the function properly handles different date units.

5. Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import to_datetime

class Parser():
    # Corrected function for converting to date
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                np.isnan(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = [self.date_unit] if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- Changed `data.astype("int64")` to `new_data.astype("int64")` to assign the result back to `new_data`.
- Replaced `isna` with `np.isnan` for handling NaN values.
- Removed the check for `iNaT` as it was not defined in the given code.
- Wrapped `self.date_unit` in a list to handle multiple date units properly.
- Handled potential errors during the date conversion and returned the result accordingly.
