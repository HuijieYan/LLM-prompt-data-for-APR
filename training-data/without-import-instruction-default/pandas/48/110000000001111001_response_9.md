The bug in the function seems to be coming from the calculation of the aggregation result. The result variable is not being set correctly, leading to incorrect output. 

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the result variable is being set and calculated properly for the aggregation function. We also need to ensure that the agg_block is being created correctly based on the result.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result[0])

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

This corrected code should now properly calculate the aggregation result using the grouper.aggregate function and create the agg_block based on that result. This should ensure that the function produces the expected output based on the provided input parameters and the variables at the function's return.
