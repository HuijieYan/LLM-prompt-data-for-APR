The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The error message indicates an issue with casting array values from dtype 'float64' to 'int64' according to the rule 'safe', which suggests a problem with type conversion in the function.

The function seems to be handling aggregation of DataFrame blocks within a group. The error message occurs while attempting to cast float values to integer values, which is not feasible.

The issue could be due to the function trying to cast the values to an inappropriate data type, i.e., from 'float64' to 'int64'.

To fix the bug, the type conversion logic within the function needs to be modified to handle the dtype appropriately based on the input data. The function should ensure that the casting operation does not result in loss of data, especially when converting floating-point numbers to integers.

A possible approach to fix the bug would be to add a condition to check the data type before type casting. If the data type is 'int64', then avoid any casting operations. Otherwise, handle the type conversion based on the dtype of the data.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # ... (other existing code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code)

        if block.values.dtype == 'float64':
            result = block.values.astype('object')  # Convert to object type to handle float values
        else:
            result = block.values  # Do not perform any casting for integer values

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (existing code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the above corrected version, a condition is added to check the dtype of the block values. If it's 'float64', the values are converted to 'object' type to handle float values, ensuring no loss of data. If it's not 'float64', no casting operation is performed to preserve the original data type. This should address the type conversion issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
