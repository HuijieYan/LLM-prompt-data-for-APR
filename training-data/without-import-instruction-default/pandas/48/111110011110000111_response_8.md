Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug is related to the safe casting of values within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when attempting to cast array from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'. This aligns with the GitHub issue where calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the safe casting of values to the dtype. This is causing a conflict between the float and integer data types.

To fix the bug, the safe casting of values should be handled in a way that accommodates both float and integer data types, especially when dealing with nullable integer data types.

Here's the corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            # Perform safe casting of values
            result = pd.arrays._safe_reshape_copy(result, (1, -1), "block")

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Update the locs in the blocks
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the safe casting of values is handled using `pd.arrays._safe_reshape_copy` to ensure that the casting is done in a manner that accommodates both float and integer data types.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
