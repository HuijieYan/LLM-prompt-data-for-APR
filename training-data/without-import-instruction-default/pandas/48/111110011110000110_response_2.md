The issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely caused by the casting of values, resulting in a `TypeError` when attempting to safely cast a non-equivalent `float64` to `int64`.

To fix this, you can update the function as follows:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...
    ...
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code

        # replace the original code with the following
        if block.is_extension:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except TypeError:
                ...
    ...
    ...
```

This modification addresses the issue of safely casting non-equivalent `float64` to `int64` by handling the separate case of extension block values, covering the scenario where the original code was causing the TypeError due to an incorrect casting approach. After making this change, the function should be able to handle the casting without raising a `TypeError` for non-equivalent types, resolving the issue.
