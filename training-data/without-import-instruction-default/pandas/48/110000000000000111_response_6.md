1. The buggy function _cython_agg_blocks is related to the GitHub issue because it is called during the aggregation process in a DataFrameGroupBy operation, which is where the bug is occurring.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the try-except block, specifically in the part that handles the aggregation using the self.grouper.aggregate method.

3. The bug's cause is that when using the new nullable integer data type (Int64) in a DataFrame, calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError. The code attempts to handle this case in the try-except block, but it does not handle it correctly, leading to the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring proper handling of the Int64 data type during aggregation operations, specifically for mean, median, and std.
   - Checking for the data type and implementing conditional logic to handle nullable integers appropriately.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            # Handle the specific error for nullable integer data type (Int64)
            if alt is not None and np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.integer):
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the try-except block has been adjusted to handle both NotImplementedError and TypeError related to the nullable integer data type (Int64), as described in the GitHub issue. This should allow for proper aggregation when dealing with Int64 data type in the DataFrameGroupBy operation.
