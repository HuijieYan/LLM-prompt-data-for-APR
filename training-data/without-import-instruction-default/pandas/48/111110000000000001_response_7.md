Here is the analysis and solution to the identified issues:

1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which inherits from `GroupBy`. This function is used to perform aggregation on data, but there are potential issues in the implementation which are causing the bug.

2. The potential error location is when the `aggregate` method is being called on `self.grouper`. This could be where the bug is originating from.

3. The bug is likely caused by an issue in the logic of how the aggregation and handling of different types of data is being performed. The code seems to be trying to handle various scenarios, such as splitting object-dtype blocks and dealing with exceptions, but it is doing so in a complex manner which can lead to errors and unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, a simpler and more concise approach to handling different data types and aggregating them is needed. This could involve refactoring the logic to be more modular and easier to understand, and perhaps simplifying the process of handling data types and exceptions.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
    
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
    
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(np.ndarray, result.values)
    
            if result is not None:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
                new_items.append(locs)
    
        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function has been simplified to focus on the main logic of performing aggregation. Unnecessary complexity has been removed, and the handling of different data types and exceptions has been made clearer. This should help to avoid the bugs that were present in the original implementation.
