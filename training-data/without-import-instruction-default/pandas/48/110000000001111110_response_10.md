The issue in the provided function seems to be related to the treatment of nullable integer data types. To fix this, the function should explicitly handle the nullable integers when performing the aggregation.

Here's an updated version of the function that includes explicit handling of nullable integers when performing the aggregation:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.internals.managers import BlockManager

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[pd.DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if block.dtype == "Int64":
                result = getattr(block, how)(skipna=False)
            else:
                result = block._try_aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = obj.groupby(self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.agg(alt)
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = result.squeeze()
                    if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
                        result = result.values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype == "Int64":
                result = result.astype("Int64")

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This function now explicitly checks for the "Int64" dtype and handles the aggregation accordingly. This should resolve the TypeErrors related to calling aggregates on nullable integer data types.

Additionally, using nullable integer data types with groupby and aggregation is a known issue and has been reported on the Pandas GitHub repository. To further track and contribute to the resolution of the issue, a detailed description of the problem and the expected behavior should be submitted as a new issue on the GitHub repository.

The detailed description for the GitHub issue is provided, including the exact problem scenario and expected behavior, along with system information and version details.

I hope this helps resolve the issue you encountered!
