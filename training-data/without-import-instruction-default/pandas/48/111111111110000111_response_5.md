The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely causing the TypeError when trying to cast values from float64 to int64. This function is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class and is called by the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions, which are also failing in the test code.

The bug may be caused by the function not handling the nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) properly when trying to aggregate the data within the group.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to handle nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) properly when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and var. This may involve handling the conversion of nullable integer dtype to float64 before performing the aggregation.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = block.values  # initialize result with the original values
        dtype = result.dtype  # store the original dtype
        if is_integer_dtype(dtype) and dtype.kind in 'iu':  # check if the dtype is integer
            result = result.astype(float)  # convert integer to float before aggregation

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                result, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle the exception
            # ...

        # process the results and add to agg_blocks and new_items
        # ...

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we handle the conversion of integer dtype to float before performing the aggregation. This should address the TypeError when trying to cast from float64 to int64.

Additionally, the changes made in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report related to calling mean, median, and var on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
