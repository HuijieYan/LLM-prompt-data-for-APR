The problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class and performs aggregation on the data within the groupby object. It calls the `_get_data_to_aggregate` method to retrieve the data to be aggregated and then processes the data to perform aggregation. The bug in the function seems to be related to the logic that aggregates the data within the groupby object, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the aggregation logic where the function is processing the data blocks one by one and aggregating them based on the given criteria. It may be that the logic related to managing the results of the aggregation or handling exceptions during the aggregation process is causing the bug.

The bug's cause is related to the aggregation logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The method iterates over the data blocks, performs aggregation on each block, and collects the results. However, there may be issues related to how the results are managed or how exceptions are handled during the aggregation process, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Review and update the logic for aggregating the data blocks to ensure that the results are correctly collected and managed.
2. Add appropriate error handling to handle exceptions during the aggregation process and prevent unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: Index = data.items

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                # Exclude the block if alternative method is not available
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # Exclude the block if exception occurs during aggregation
                continue
        if result is not None:
            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the logic for aggregating the data blocks has been simplified and updated to ensure that the results are correctly collected and managed. Also, appropriate error handling has been added to handle exceptions during the aggregation process.
