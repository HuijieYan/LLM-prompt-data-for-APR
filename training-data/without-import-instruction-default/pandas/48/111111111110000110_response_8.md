```

I fixed the function by making the following changes:

1. Changed the function call `self.grouper.aggregate` to `self._cython_agg_general` to appropriately handle the aggregation operation.
2. Added exception handling for `TypeError` and `NotImplementedError` in the except block to handle exceptions that may arise during the aggregation process.
3. Removed unnecessary code for casting and downcasting as it was not necessary for the aggregation operation being performed.
4. Updated the method for constructing the `agg_block` and modified the logic for appending new items and agg_blocks.

These changes should resolve the issues that were causing the TypeError and make the function work as expected.
