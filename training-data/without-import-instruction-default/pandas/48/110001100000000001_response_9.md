Potential error location: The error may be caused by incorrect handling of the data when aggregating, including potential issues with splitting object-dtype blocks or numeric_only flag.

Cause of the bug:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of different block types, potential issues with how numeric_only flag is applied, and potential problems with the splitting of object-dtype blocks. Additionally, there might be issues with the way the result is being aggregated and transformed.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the handling of different block types is consistent and correct.
2. Review and refactor how the numeric_only flag is being applied to the data.
3. Verify the splitting of object-dtype blocks and ensure it is handled correctly.
4. Review the aggregation and transformation process to identify and fix potential issues.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    try:
        # Perform aggregation using BlockManager.combine
        result_data = data.combine(how=how)

        # Extract the aggregated blocks and items
        agg_blocks = result_data.blocks
        agg_items = result_data.items
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception, e.g., raise an error or log the exception
        raise RuntimeError(f"Error occurred during aggregation: {str(e)}")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the function performs aggregation using `BlockManager.combine()` method, which helps in simplifying the process and potentially resolving the issues related to handling different block types and the numeric_only flag. Additionally, error handling has been added to catch any exceptions during the aggregation process.
