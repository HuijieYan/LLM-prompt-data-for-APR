1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class and is used to aggregate data. It seems to be trying to aggregate data from a BlockManager and handle different cases such as when `numeric_only` is `True`, and when an operation is not implemented.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the handling of different cases and the resulting aggregation blocks and items. The error might also be related to the handling of split blocks and the subsequent sorting and indexing of the aggregated items.

3. The cause of the bug could be related to improper handling of the different aggregation cases, incorrect indexing, or issues with the splitting of blocks. Errors related to the computation of aggregation items and blocks may lead to unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, possible approaches could include:
   - Reviewing the logic for handling different cases of aggregation and ensuring that the items and blocks are correctly aggregated and managed.
   - Checking the indexing and sorting operations to ensure that the correct items are being aggregated and that any deleted items are properly handled.
   - Reviewing the handling of split blocks to ensure that the resulting frames and items are correctly incorporated into the aggregation results.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []
    deleted_items: List[int] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            # Perform aggregation using the grouper
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-implemented operations
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        else:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.extend(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.array(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the function streamlines the process of aggregation and ensures that the correct items and blocks are aggregated. It also handles non-implemented operations and performs proper indexing and sorting of the aggregated items.
