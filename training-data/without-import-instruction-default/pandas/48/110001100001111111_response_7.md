The issue seems to be with calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object that contains nullable integer data type. The error occurs when trying to perform aggregation operations like mean, median, and std on the DataFrameGroupBy object.

After analyzing the provided code, the issue seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the function to handle nullable integer data type properly when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._try_aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.arange(len(data))
    agg_items = data.items
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This code handles the aggregation operations directly on the data blocks without relying on the `self.grouper` object, which seems to be causing the issue. It should resolve the problem with calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer data type.

This approach should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue, as it provides a proper and accurate handling of nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations.

Please note that the correction is based on the provided information and the assumption about the nature of the bug. A thorough review and testing of the code in various scenarios is suggested before implementation.
