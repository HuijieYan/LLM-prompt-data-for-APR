The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing with a TypeError when trying to cast float64 values to int64. This is happening when calling the mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The issue is well-documented in the GitHub issue and is related to the new nullable integer data type.

The root cause of the bug seems to be in how the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is handling the data when performing aggregation operations on nullable integer data.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data type properly during aggregation operations. Specifically, the function should handle the float values that result from aggregation operations in a way that does not lead to a TypeError when casting to int64.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
      
        if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = result.values

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = np.concatenate(new_items)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code ensures that the aggregation operations handle nullable integer data properly and should resolve the TypeError issue when calling mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
