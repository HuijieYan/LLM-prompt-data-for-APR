To fix the bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the given pandas/core/groupby/generic.py file. The function is currently failing when trying to handle grouping operations, such as mean, median, and var, on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The issue seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer types when performing numeric aggregations.

Here's a potential fix for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ...
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        # Handle nullable integers by converting them to regular integers
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # ...

    # The rest of the function remains the same

```

In the updated code, we use the `convert_dtypes()` method to ensure that the nullable integer columns are converted to regular integers before performing numeric aggregations. This should address the TypeError issue when applying aggregations like mean, median, and var to a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

After applying this fix, the users should be able to perform the intended aggregations without encountering the TypeError. Remember to document these changes and submit them as a pull request to the pandas repository on GitHub.

The GitHub issue title for this bug could be:
```
Calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype results in TypeError
```

The GitHub issue's detailed description should include the details about the problem, the expected output, and the proposed fix, along with any relevant version information obtained from `pd.show_versions()`.
