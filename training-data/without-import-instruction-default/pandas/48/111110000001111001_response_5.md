Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug is likely occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function is intended to perform aggregation on data based on certain conditions, and generate a list of aggregated blocks and items.

The bug seems to be related to the aggregation process itself, particularly in cases where the `how` argument is set to 'mean', 'median' or 'var'. The provided values for the `agg_blocks` and `agg_item` variables do not match the expected output. This discrepancy is likely due to an issue with the aggregation logic, which is not producing the correct results.

To fix the bug, the aggregation logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially rewritten. This may involve debugging the aggregation process for different aggregation methods (e.g. mean, median, var) and ensuring that the calculations are being performed correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function based on the provided information:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            # perform aggregation based on the given 'how' method
            if how == 'mean':
                result = block.values.mean(axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            elif how == 'median':
                result = block.values.median(axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            elif how == 'var':
                result = block.values.var(axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            else:
                # handle other aggregation methods
                result = block.values.agg(method=how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        # rest of the code for handling deleted_items, split_items, etc.

        return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

This corrected version includes explicit handling for different aggregation methods ('mean', 'median', 'var') and a generic handling for other aggregation methods.

It's important to note that the exact nature of the bug and the approach for fixing it may vary depending on the specific logic of the aggregation process within the class. Therefore, additional context and understanding of the broader codebase may be necessary to provide a precise and comprehensive solution.
