1. The buggy function seems to be intended for aggregation of data, but it contains errors that may lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

2. The potential error is likely to be in the handling of the aggregated blocks and items, as well as the management of the "agg_items" and "mgr_locs".

3. The cause of the bug in the code could be due to incorrect management of the aggregation process, such as handling of split blocks, and managing the indexer and agg_items.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic for handling split blocks, ensuring correct mapping of items to the aggregated blocks, and addressing any issues with the indexer and deleted items.

5. Here's the corrected code:
```python
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block
from pandas import DataFrame, Index, Series, DataError
from pandas.core.internals.managers import BlockManager
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple, cast

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise DataError("Unable to perform the operation")

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = obj.groupby(self.grouper.nkeys).agg(alt)
            result = s if isinstance(s, Series) else s.values

        if len(result.shape) == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    new_items = np.concatenate(new_items)

    agg_items = data.items.take(new_items)
    offsets = np.zeros(len(data))
    offsets[new_items] = 1
    offsets = np.cumsum(offsets) - 1

    for i, block in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        block.mgr_locs = np.unique(offsets[block.mgr_locs])

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
It's important to note that the corrected code is a hypothetical solution based on the provided buggy function. Additionally, any modifications may depend on the context and specific use case of the given function.
