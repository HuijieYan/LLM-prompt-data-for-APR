The issue in the function is that it is attempting to safely cast a float64 array to an int64 array, which is not possible. To fix this issue, we need to update the function to handle the case where it encounters a float64 array and avoid attempting to cast it to int64. To address this, we can modify the function to perform the aggregation directly on the float64 array if the input is float64.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            agg_blocks.append(result._data.blocks[0])
        else:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # update the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making these changes, the function should be able to handle the aggregation of numeric data without encountering the TypeError related to casting between float64 and int64.
