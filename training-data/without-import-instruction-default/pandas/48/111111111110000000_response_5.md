The issue in the buggy function lies in the necessity to safely cast the values to the dtype without loss of information, specifically casting float values from 'float64' to 'int64'.

Here's the corrected version of the function that handles this issue:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/groupby/ops.py

# This function is an updated version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        for i in range(len(locs)):
            if pd.isna(locs[i]):
                if i == 0:
                    locs[i] = 0       # Replace NA with 0 if it's the first index
                else:
                    locs[i] = locs[i-1]  # Repeat the value from the previous index
            else:
                locs[i] = int(locs[i])  # Convert to integer

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # remaining code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the issue with safely casting non-equivalent `float64` to `int64` is addressed by checking for NA values and replacing them with 0 or with the previous index, ensuring that the values are safely cast without loss of information.

This should resolve the TypeError mentioned in the failing tests related to casting float to int and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
