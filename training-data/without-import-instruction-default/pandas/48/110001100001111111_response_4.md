The buggy function is failing when calling mean, median, and std after grouping a DataFrame with Int64 dtype. The issue seems to stem from how the function handles numeric aggregation operations with nullable integer data types.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function is processing the nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations. It appears that the function is unable to handle the nullable integer data type properly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle nullable integer data types correctly when performing numeric aggregation operations. This may involve checking for null values and handling them appropriately during the aggregation process.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Error handling for nullable integer data type
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_nullable(block.values):
            block = block.dropna()
            
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the processing code remains unchanged
    ...
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code includes error handling for nullable integer data types, specifically by dropping null values before performing the aggregation operation. This approach should ensure that the function can handle nullable integer data types correctly and prevent the TypeError from occurring.
