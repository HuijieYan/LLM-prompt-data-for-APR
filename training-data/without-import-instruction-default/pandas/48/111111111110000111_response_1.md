Based on the information provided, the bug seems to be related to the casting of values from float64 to int64 when using nullable integer data type, which results in a TypeError. The bug is occurring in the _cython_agg_blocks function of the DataFrameGroupBy class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it tries to cast values from float64 to int64.

The bug's cause is related to the inability to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, which is causing the TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking the dtype of the values before casting and handling the casting based on the dtype.
2. Using a different method for aggregating the data to avoid the casting issue.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            result = result.astype(block.dtype)
        elif isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.applymap(lambda x: x.astype(block.dtype))

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This corrected code should handle the casting of values based on their dtype, ensuring that the aggregation function works properly without raising a TypeError.

By using this corrected code, the function should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
