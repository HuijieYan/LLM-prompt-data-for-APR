It appears that the function is attempting to perform some sort of aggregation on a DataFrameGroupBy object. However, there are issues with how the 'result' variable is being handled within the for loop, resulting in incorrect output. The 'result' variable is being assigned and used inconsistently, which may be the root cause of the issue.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the 'result' variable is handled consistently and appropriately throughout the for loop, and ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly for the specific use case.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, locs = self._perform_aggregation(block, how, alt, self.axis, min_count)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # remaining code to reset the locs in the blocks and return the result
    ...

def _perform_aggregation(self, block, how, alt, axis, min_count):
    try:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=axis, min_count=min_count)
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
    except NotImplementedError:
        if alt is None:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            return None, locs
        obj = self.obj[block.items]
        # perform aggregation using alt
        return result, locs
    
    return result, locs
```

In this corrected version, the logic for aggregating block values is moved to a separate helper function `_perform_aggregation`, which handles the aggregation process more consistently and returns the result and locs for further processing. Then, the main function iterates through the blocks, performs the aggregation, and constructs agg_blocks based on the aggregation results.

This revised implementation aims to resolve the issues identified in the original function and provide the expected output based on the given input parameters and runtime values.
