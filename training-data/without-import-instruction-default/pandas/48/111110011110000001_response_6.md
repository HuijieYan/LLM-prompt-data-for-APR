The provided code is a part of the pandas library for data manipulation in Python. The failing test is related to the application of certain statistical functions on DataFrameGroupBy objects. The error is related to casting from float64 to int64, indicating a potential type conversion issue.

Upon analyzing the provided code and the error messages, it appears that the issue lies within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. Specifically, the function is attempting to cast float64 values to int64, which is causing a TypeError due to non-equivalent data types.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the operations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function are consistent with the data types involved. This may involve checking for missing values, converting the data types as needed, and handling the operations accordingly.
2. Add validation checks for data type compatibility before performing operations that involve data type conversions.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function addressing the potential type conversion issue:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        # Convert the data to a compatible type if needed
        if data._is_float() and data._is_integer():
            data = data.astype('float64')

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, a validation check is added to ensure that the data is in a compatible type before performing operations. This avoids the potential type conversion issue highlighted in the failing test.

Please note that the actual fix may require a deeper understanding of the codebase and the specific requirements of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class within the pandas library. Any changes should also consider the broader implications on the functionality and performance of the library.
