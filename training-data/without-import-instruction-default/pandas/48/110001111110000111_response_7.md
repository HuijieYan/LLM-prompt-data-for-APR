The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type (dtype='Int64') when using the mean, median, and var functions after grouping. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

Upon analyzing the provided code and the related failing test, it appears that the issue is arising from the _cython_agg_blocks function, specifically in the part where it is attempting to cast the result to the original dtype. This is creating a conflict when dealing with nullable integer data types.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the nullable integer data type appropriately and ensure that the casting is done in a way that accommodates nullable integer values.

Here's the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            try:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            except TypeError:
                # Handling cast error for nullable integer data type
                result = result.astype("float64")
        
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function handles the casting of result to the original dtype in a way that accommodates nullable integer values. It catches the TypeError when attempting to downcast nullable integer and handles it appropriately by converting the result to float64. This should resolve the TypeError when using mean, median, and var functions with nullable integer data type.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and also resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug description.
