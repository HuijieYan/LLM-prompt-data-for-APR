The issue seems to be related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which results in a TypeError. The expected output is not being generated, and the issue affects other functions like median and std as well. This error is not occurring with other data types.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to how the mean function is being handled when the input data has Int64 dtype.

The bug's cause is likely due to the mean function not being able to handle the Int64 dtype properly, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _cython_agg_blocks function to handle the mean function and other related functions properly when the input data has Int64 dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        if data._is_homogeneous_type(dtype="Int64"):
            data = data.astype('float64')

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding a check for the homogeneous type of the data and converting it into float64 if the type is Int64, we can ensure that the mean function and other related functions can handle the data properly without resulting in a TypeError.

This correction should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and provide the expected output. It also satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
