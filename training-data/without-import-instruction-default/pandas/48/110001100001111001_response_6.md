From the provided information, it seems that the buggy function is encountering an issue with the calculation of the aggregation result. The variables `result` and `agg_block` are being calculated incorrectly based on the provided input parameters. It looks like there might be an issue with the aggregation calculation or with the handling of missing values (NA) in the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, it would be best to review the calculation process within the function and ensure that it properly handles missing values. Additionally, the calculation of the aggregation result should be verified for correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.values.agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(i, i + loc, 1))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the aggregation process is simplified and the calculation of the result is based on the `agg` method of the DataFrame. Additionally, the handling of missing values is taken care of by the `agg` method. This should resolve the issue and provide the expected output based on the input parameters.
