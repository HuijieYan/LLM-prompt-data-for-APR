1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method in the `groupby` module of the pandas library. It is responsible for aggregating data in a grouped object. The function calls methods from the same file, such as `_get_data_to_aggregate`, and handles operations on the data. The function relates to the GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError" because it is involved in the aggregation process within a DataFrameGroupBy object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function may be related to the handling of nullable integer data type or the aggregation process itself, as described in the GitHub issue. Specifically, the code might be facing issues when trying to aggregate columns of `Int64` dtype, leading to unexpected TypeError.

3. (a). The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for aggregating data within a grouped object. It attempts to handle different scenarios and exceptions that may arise during the aggregation process.

   (b). The related function `_get_data_to_aggregate` is responsible for obtaining the data to be aggregated within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

   (c). The GitHub issue highlights the problem occurring when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but occurs with `median` and `std`. This information suggests potential issues with the aggregation process and handling of the `Int64` dtype when computing certain aggregate functions.

4. To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
   (a). Review and update the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately.
   (b). Address any issues related to aggregation methods such as `mean`, `median`, and `std` when handling `Int64` dtype.
   (c). Ensure that the aggregation process handles different data types and scenarios consistently and without unexpected TypeErrors.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None

        if block.dtype.type == np.integer:  # Check for integer dtype
            result = block._cython_agg_general(how, alt=alt)

        if result is None:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In the corrected code, we explicitly check for integer dtype and call the appropriate aggregation method `_cython_agg_general` for integer blocks. This ensures that the `Int64` dtype is handled appropriately during aggregation, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
