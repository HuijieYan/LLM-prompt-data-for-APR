1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to aggregate data using the `grouper` attribute, which is likely where the bug is located.
2. The potential error location in the code is where the `self.grouper.aggregate` method is being called within the for loop over `data.blocks`.
3. The bug's cause is that when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, it results in a TypeError. This could be due to the way the `grouper` is being used to perform the aggregation.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a) Checking the specific data type and handling the aggregation differently for the Int64 dtype.
   (b) Implementing a conditional check to use an alternate method for aggregation when encountering the Int64 dtype.
5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except TypeError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we handle the TypeError exception when calling `self.grouper.aggregate` and provide an alternative aggregation method using the `alt` function if it's not None. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
