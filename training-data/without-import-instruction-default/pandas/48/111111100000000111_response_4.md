1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, related functions, and the GitHub issue:

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` file. This function handles the aggregation of data within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError. This is a problem related to handling nullable integer data types.

2. Identifying the potential error location within the problematic function:

The potential error location within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely related to how it handles the `Int64` data type when performing aggregation operations.

3. Elucidating the bug's cause:

(a). The buggy function: `_cython_agg_blocks` incorrectly handles the `Int64` data type when performing aggregation, leading to a TypeError.

(b). The buggy class: `DataFrameGroupBy` class may not be properly handling nullable integer data types during aggregation.

(c). The related function: Other related functions within the same file may not be properly handling the `Int64` data type during aggregation operations.

(d). The GitHub Issue information: The GitHub issue clearly states that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError. This aligns with the potential issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

A. Inspect the handling of nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and ensure it is compatible with pandas' nullable integer data types.

B. Update the aggregation logic to handle nullable integer data types in a way that prevents the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.

C. Implement type-checking and type-casting to correctly handle nullable integer data types during aggregation operations.

5. Presenting the corrected code for the problematic function:

Below is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # Updated code to handle nullable integer data types
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

        # Handle nullable integer data types
        if hasattr(data.dtypes, 'has_extension_type') and data.dtypes.has_extension_type:
            data = data._consolidate_inplace()

        # Rest of the aggregation logic remains unchanged
        # ...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please note that the above code may require further adjustments based on the specific requirements of handling nullable integer data types within pandas. Additionally, modifications to other related functions and classes may also be necessary to fully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
