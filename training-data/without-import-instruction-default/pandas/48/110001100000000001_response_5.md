The potential error location within the problematic function could be the try-except block where it catches a NotImplementedError and a TypeError. These exceptions interrupt the loop and continue without processing the block, leading to potential issues in the output.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the try-except block properly handles the exceptions and continues processing the block, rather than skipping it altogether.
2. Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms for the specific exceptions being caught.
3. Consider refactoring the try-except block to handle these exceptions in a more controlled manner.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError as e:
            if alt is None:
                raise e
            else:
                result = self._handle_alternate_aggregate(block, alt)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # The rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the code above, the try-except block has been modified to handle the NotImplementedError in a more controlled manner. When the NotImplementedError is caught and an alternate method is available, it is handled by the `_handle_alternate_aggregate` method. This ensures that the processing continues even when an error occurs.
