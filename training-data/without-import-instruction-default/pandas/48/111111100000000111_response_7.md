The problematic function is `_cython_agg_blocks` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. 

The issue relates to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype causing a `TypeError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that handles the aggregation of data blocks. Specifically, the error may be related to how the function is handling nullable integer data types during the aggregation process.

The bug's cause stems from how the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is aggregating data blocks. It appears that the function may not be handling nullable integer data types correctly, leading to a `TypeError` when the `mean` function is called on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle nullable integer data types during the aggregation process. This may involve checking for the data type and implementing specific handling for nullable integer data types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Check if the result is non-null before creating the agg_block
        if pd.notna(result):
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = data.items[[idx for arr in new_items for idx in arr]]
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code includes checks for non-null values before creating the `agg_block`, ensuring that nullable integer data types are handled appropriately during the aggregation process.
