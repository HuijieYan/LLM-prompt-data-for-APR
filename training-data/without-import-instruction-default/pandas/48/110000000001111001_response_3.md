The bug in the function seems to be related to the processing of the block values and the resulting aggregation. The variable `result` is being incorrectly assigned and manipulated, leading to unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation of the block values is performed correctly, and that the resulting `agg_block` is created and appended to the `agg_blocks` list properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
  
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("No valid alt provided for aggregation")
                
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            result = obj.agg(axis=self.axis, func=alt)

        assert not isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No valid blocks were aggregated")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we modify the aggregation process by using the `agg` function to handle the aggregation of block values with a custom function (`alt`) in case the initial aggregation fails. We also added error handling to raise an exception if no valid alternative function is provided.

This corrected code should now handle the aggregation of block values correctly based on the input parameters, as well as satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
