The issue is caused by the use of the nullable integer data type, 'Int64', when calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy. The bug results in a TypeError. This occurs with the median and std functions as well, but not with min, max, or first.

Here is the fix for the bug in the provided function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric=True, copy=False)  # Ensuring the data is numeric
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This adjustment will ensure that the data is appropriately converted to numeric types before calling any aggregation functions, which should resolve the TypeErrors being encountered.
