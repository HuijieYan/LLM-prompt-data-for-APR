1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is related to a GitHub issue where calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely within the try-except block, particularly in the section where it handles the aggregation using `self.grouper.aggregate`.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the way the function handles the aggregation when the data type is Int64. It seems to have trouble with the aggregation process, resulting in a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the data type of the input before aggregation, ensuring that the aggregation process can handle Int64 types, and possibly modifying the way the function processes and aggregates the data.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, alt=alt)
        
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    agg_items = data.items
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code aims to simplify the aggregation process by directly calling the `agg` method on each block and handling any necessary reshaping of the results. It also removes unnecessary variables and checks, simplifying the overall structure of the function.
