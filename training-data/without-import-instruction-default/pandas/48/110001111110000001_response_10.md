The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be causing a TypeError related to the casting of float64 to int64. It is likely that the issue is with the data types being used within the function.

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` calls the function `maybe_downcast_numeric`, which suggests that the issue may be related to casting or downcasting of data types.

The failing test is attempting to use the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on some integer data, and expects the result to be a DataFrame with float values. However, the function is currently returning int64 values, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the aggregation results in float values rather than int values. This likely involves modifying the handling of data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Convert the result to float if the data type is int64
        if result.dtype == np.int64:
            result = result.astype(float)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we directly convert the result to float if its data type is int64. This should ensure that the function returns the expected float values, resolving the TypeError encountered in the failing test.
