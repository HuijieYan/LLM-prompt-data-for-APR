The issue appears to be related to the function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, specifically when calling the `mean` method on a nullable integer data type (`Int64`). The function is intended to aggregate data based on certain parameters, but it seems to be encountering a TypeError when processing nullable integer data types.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, leading to a TypeError when certain aggregation methods are applied.

To fix the bug, the handling of nullable integer data types within the function needs to be addressed. This may involve checking and handling nullable values appropriately to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Handle nullable integer data types
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_nullable_dtype(block.dtype):
            block = block.fillna(-1)  # assuming -1 as the fill value for NA
        # Rest of the code remains the same...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This code includes a check for nullable integer data types and fills the NA values with a default value (-1 in this case) to avoid TypeError during aggregation. This approach should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
