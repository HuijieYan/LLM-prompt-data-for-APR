Potential Error Location:
Based on the information provided in the GitHub issue, the bug occurs when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the `Int64` data type, resulting in a TypeError. The error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but does also occur with `median` and `std`.

Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. This function is responsible for performing aggregation operations on grouped data, and the error seems to be related to handling nullable integer data types while performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`. The function may lack proper handling of the `Int64` data type when performing these operations.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a check for handling nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure proper aggregation operations for `mean`, `median`, and `std`.
2. Update the aggregation logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data types correctly when performing aggregation operations.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
Below is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with added handling for nullable integer data types.

```python
# Import necessary modules
from typing import List, Tuple
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block
from pandas.core.internals.managers import BlockManager
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.groupby.generic import DataError, GroupBy
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import get_groupby
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_dtype_equal

class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):
    # ... (other class methods)

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # Existing code goes here ...

        if numeric_only:
            # Handle nullable integer data type
            if is_dtype_equal(data._dba.items.dtype, 'Int64'):
                data = data.dropna().astype('int64')._dba

        # Existing code continues ...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code includes a check for handling nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure proper aggregation operations for `mean`, `median`, and `std` when grouping with `Int64` data type.
