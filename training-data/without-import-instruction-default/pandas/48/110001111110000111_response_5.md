After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the bug is caused by the data type mismatch when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with columns of nullable integer data type (`Int64`). This results in a TypeError when attempting to cast float values to an integer data type.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly when computing the mean, median, and var functions.

The correction to the buggy function is as follows:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.internals.blocks import Block
from pandas.core.internals.managers import BlockManager
from pandas.core.arrays.integer import coerce_to_array, safe_cast, maybe_downcast_numeric
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import GroupBy

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame) and len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
            result = result.mean(axis=1)  # Aggregating using mean for non-split object-dtype blocks

        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        if block.is_extension:
            result = safe_cast(result, block.dtype, copy=False)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected function, we handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately when computing the aggregation functions. We ensure that the result is downcasted to an appropriate data type before creating the new blocks for aggregation.

This correction should address the TypeError issue when calling `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy with columns of nullable integer data type (`Int64`). This updated function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

Hopefully, this resolution will effectively solve the bug and provide accurate results for the aggregation functions on nullable integer data types in the DataFrameGroupBy object.
