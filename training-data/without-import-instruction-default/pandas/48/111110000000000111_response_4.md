1. The erroneous function is part of the DataFrameGroupBy class in the pandas library. The GitHub issue describes the problem as calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError. The issue is reported for pandas version 1.0.1 and Python version 3.7.3.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the way the function handles blocks and performs aggregation.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) when performing aggregation operations such as mean, median, and std on a grouped DataFrame. The `DataFrameGroupBy` class is a subclass of the `GroupBy` class and inherits methods for aggregation. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` has a condition for `numeric_only` and performs aggregation on the data, but it fails to handle the nullable integer data type correctly, leading to a TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer data type correctly when performing aggregation.
   (b) Ensure that the aggregation operations are compatible with the Int64 dtype and handle the data appropriately based on its type.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.is_numeric():
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the function iterates through the blocks in the data and only performs aggregation operations if the block is numeric, handling the nullable integer data type appropriately. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
