Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, particularly when trying to cast values from float64 to int64.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by an error in handling the casting of values from float64 to int64 within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This results in a TypeError when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if there's an issue with the safe casting of values from float64 to int64.
2. Verify if the dtype handling for nullable integers is causing the casting error.
3. Review the implementation of `_cython_agg_blocks` to ensure proper casting of values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Handle safe casting of values from float64 to int64
        try:
            result = result.astype(int)
        except TypeError:
            result = result.astype(float)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the original function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code handles the safe casting of values from float64 to int64 by using a try-except block to first attempt casting to int and then fallback to float if necessary. The rest of the function should remain unchanged. This should resolve the casting issue and ensure that the function passes the failing test and addresses the problem described in the GitHub issue.
