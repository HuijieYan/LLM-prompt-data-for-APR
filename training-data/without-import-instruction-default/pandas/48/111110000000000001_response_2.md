1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is derived from `GroupBy`. It appears to be responsible for performing some sort of aggregation on the data contained within the class.

2. The potential error location within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function could be related to the logic for handling split blocks, as well as the management of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items`.

3. The bug's cause seems to be related to the logic for handling split blocks and in the implementation of handling `deleted_items`. The error may relate to incorrect handling of indexers, which are used to manipulate the data and blocks.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include revisiting the logic for handling split blocks and deleted items, as well as improving the management of indexers and data manipulations within the function.


5. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please note that the code above simplifies the error handling logic and removes the split block handling, which was causing the bug. Further modifications may be required based on the specific requirements and functionality of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.
