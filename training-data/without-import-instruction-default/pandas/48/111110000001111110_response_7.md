The issue with the original function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the nullable integer data type, resulting in a `TypeError` when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and std.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the aggregation operations properly handle the nullable integer data type by implementing appropriate checks and conversions.

Here is a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_to_cython_if_frame()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = data._agg_blocks(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we utilize the `convert_to_cython_if_frame` method to properly handle the nullable integer data type and ensure that aggregation operations work as expected. Additionally, we use the `_agg_blocks` method to simplify the aggregation process based on the provided parameters.

This fix should address the TypeErrors and ensure that mean, median, and other aggregation operations work correctly on DataFrames with nullable integer data types.
