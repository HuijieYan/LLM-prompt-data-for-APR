The bug in the provided function involves an error when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. To fix this, the function needs to be modified to handle the Int64 dtype properly when performing aggregations.

It appears that the problem is related to the handling of nullable integer data types (Int64) in the mean aggregation function of the DataFrameGroupBy. The bug occurs when calling mean after grouping with the dtype Int64. The function should be modified to handle this scenario correctly and produce the expected output.

The fix could involve adding an explicit check for the Int64 dtype and implementing a custom aggregation to handle the nullable integer data type properly.

```python
# Fix the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # other initializations...

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        # Add a check for Int64 dtype and handle it explicitly
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            if block.values.attrs['dtype'].kind == 'i':
                block = block.values.astype('float64')

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the exception appropriately

        # Continue with the rest of the function...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The provided fix assumes that the issue with calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype is due to the handling of the Int64 dtype. The modified function now explicitly checks for the Int64 dtype and converts it to float64 before performing the aggregation. This should address the TypeError that occurs when calling mean with the Int64 dtype.

It's important to ensure that this fix is thoroughly tested with various scenarios involving the Int64 dtype to ensure it handles the nullable integer data type correctly in the aggregation process.
