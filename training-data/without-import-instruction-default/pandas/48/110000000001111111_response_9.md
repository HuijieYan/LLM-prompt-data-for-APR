The buggy function is failing to handle the DataFrameGroupBy.mean() operation correctly, leading to a TypeError. This is consistent with the GitHub issue where calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError when using the new nullable integer data type.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type when applying aggregation functions like mean, median, and std.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data type correctly when performing aggregation operations.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to explicitly check for nullable integer data type and handle it separately when applying the aggregation function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function that handles nullable integer data type correctly:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        # Check for nullable integer data type and handle it separately
        if data.dtypes[0].type == pd.Int64Dtype:
            data = data.apply(lambda x: x.dropna().values)
        else:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code explicitly checks for the nullable integer data type and handles it separately when applying aggregation operations. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the function works as expected.
