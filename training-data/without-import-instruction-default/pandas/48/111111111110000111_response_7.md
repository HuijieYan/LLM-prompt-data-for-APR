Upon analysis, the bug appears to be caused by the `safe_cast` function within the `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` file. This function is being triggered by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

To fix the bug, you can introduce a check in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that the datatype being used is compatible with the `safe_cast` function. Additionally, the handling of nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can be modified to prevent triggering the `safe_cast` function in the first place.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Handling nullable integer data type
    if isinstance(data.dtypes[0].type(), pd.Int64Dtype):
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handling non-applicable functions
                if alt is None:
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                # Call alt function with this block
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            # Rest of the code remains unchanged
            # ...
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
    else:
        # Handle non-nullable integer data and other data types
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Existing code remains unchanged
            # ...
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected code includes a specific handling for nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which should resolve the TypeError issue.

Please note that the correction assumes that the issue is caused by the interaction of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with nullable integer data types. If the issue persists, further investigation may be required.
