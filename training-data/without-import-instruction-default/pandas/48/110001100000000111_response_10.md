Upon analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug lies in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the pandas library. The issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. This error occurs when calling `mean` after grouping and occurs with other functions such as median and std as well.

The potential error location within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is in the part of the code that handles the aggregation using the `grouper.aggregate` method. This is where the TypeError might be originating from.

The cause of the bug is most likely related to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

For fixing the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Check for compatibility issues with the nullable integer data type and the aggregation operations being performed.
2. Include additional error handling or type casting to handle the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
