The error message and test function provided indicate that the current implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method for the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is causing a `TypeError` when attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, as it attempts to perform the conversion without checking compatibility.

The fix involves modifying the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to ensure that the float64 values are not cast to int64 without first verifying their compatibility.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous logic)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # Safely cast the values to the dtype if they are equivalent
            try:
                casted_result = result.astype(block.dtype, casting="safe")
                if result.ndim == 1:
                    result = casted_result.reshape(1, -1)
                else:
                    result = casted_result
            except TypeError:
                # Handling non-equivalent types
                raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {block.dtype}")

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (remaining logic)
```

In this corrected implementation, we added a new check to ensure that the safe cast of the calculated result to its original dtype does not raise a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent types. If the types are non-equivalent, the method will raise a `TypeError` with relevant information.

After applying this fix, the `_cython_agg_blocks` method should ensure that non-equivalent types aren't blindly cast, preventing the original issue caused by attempting to cast float64 to int64 when not compatible.
