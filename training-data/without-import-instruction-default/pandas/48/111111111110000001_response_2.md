Upon analysis of the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` and the related test code along with the error message, it appears that the issue lies in the safe cast of float values to integer. The function is failing when trying to cast float64 values to int64 using the `astype` method, causing a `TypeError` as it cannot safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

This issue is leading to the failing tests, as the expected output contains float values, but the function is attempting to cast them to integers.

To fix this issue, you can ensure that the data type of the values to be cast matches the expected data type. In this case, it seems that the expected data type of the values should be float, not int.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...

    if result is not no_result:
        # Ensure the result has the correct dtype (float) instead of trying to cast to int
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        # Other existing code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function should handle the casting of values to the correct data type without causing the `TypeError` encountered in the failing tests.

By making this change, the function should pass the failing test cases and eliminate the casting issue.
