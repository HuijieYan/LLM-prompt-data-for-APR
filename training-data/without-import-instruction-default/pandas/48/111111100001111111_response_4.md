The bug in the provided code is caused by the use of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the DataFrame when calling the `mean` function after grouping. This results in a TypeError. The issue is also observed when using other aggregation functions like `median` and `std`.

To fix the bug, you can check if the data type of the columns in the DataFrame is nullable integer (`Int64`). If it is, then convert it to a regular integer data type before performing the aggregation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        # Convert nullable integer columns to regular integer data type
        for col in data.items:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(data.iget(col)) and pd.api.types.is_nullable(data.iget(col)):
                data.iget(col) = data.iget(col).astype('Int32')
        
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
        # rest of the function remains the same
```

By converting nullable integer columns to regular integer data type before aggregation, the TypeError issue can be resolved, and the function will work as expected. This solution aligns with the GitHub issue posted and resolves the problem described in the issue.
