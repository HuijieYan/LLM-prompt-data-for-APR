The bug in the function is related to the handling of the nullable integer datatype (Int64) when calling the `mean` function after grouping in a DataFrameGroupBy object. The issue is also observed when using other aggregation functions like `median` and `std`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block where the aggregation is being computed, especially when handling the Int64 datatype.

The bug's cause can be elucidated by examining the way the function is handling the nullable integer datatype (Int64) during the aggregation process. It seems that the function is encountering issues when trying to perform aggregation operations on the Int64 datatype, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to explicitly handle the nullable integer datatype (Int64) within the aggregation function to ensure that the operations are valid for this datatype.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function. The approach involves explicitly handling the nullable integer datatype (Int64) in the aggregation process to resolve the TypeError issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values.astype('float64'), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly handle the nullable integer datatype (Int64) by converting the values to `float64` when needed for aggregation operations. This approach should resolve the TypeError issue and ensure that the aggregation functions work as expected even with the nullable integer datatype.
