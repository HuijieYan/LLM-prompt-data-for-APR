Based on the failing test and error message, the issue seems to be related to the safe casting of values. The failing test is trying to apply certain aggregation functions to nullable integer values, and it's encountering an error when trying to cast float values to integer.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of downcasting the values to the original data type in the `safe_cast` function. It seems to be encountering an issue when trying to cast float values to integer, which is causing the TypeError.

The root cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of downcasting values in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is impacting the safe casting of values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring that the downcasting of values is handled properly, especially when dealing with floats and integers.
2. Implementing a mechanism to handle the safe cast of values in a way that prevents the TypeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (code for aggregation)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            try:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            except TypeError:
                raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {np.dtype(block.dtype)}")

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (rest of the code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, we have added a try-except block for the maybe_downcast_numeric function to handle the safe casting of `result` back to the original data type. If a TypeError occurs during the downcast, it will raise an exception indicating that the casting of values is not possible.

This corrected code aims to address the issue of safe casting values and should pass the failing test.
