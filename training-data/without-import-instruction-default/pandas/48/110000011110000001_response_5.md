The error is occurring due to incorrect type casting in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The function is trying to cast float values to integers, which is causing the `safe_cast` function to raise a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent data types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type conversion is handled properly and that floats are not being cast to integers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # remaining code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By removing the code that tries to cast the result to a specific data type, we prevent the error caused by incompatible data types. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
