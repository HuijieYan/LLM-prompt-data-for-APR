1. The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be aggregating data based on certain conditions. It seems to be interacting with the `_get_data_to_aggregate` function to retrieve the data to be aggregated, and using the `aggregate` function from the same file but not the same class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be related to the handling of exceptions and the aggregation process when certain conditions are met.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be related to mishandling of data during the aggregation process, especially when encountering exceptions or alternate aggregation methods.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Refactor the exception handling to ensure that the aggregation process proceeds smoothly even when exceptions are encountered.
   b. Review the alternate aggregation method (`alt`) to ensure it is being applied correctly.
   c. Validate the logic for handling the different types of data blocks and their aggregation.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            raise ValueError("No result for aggregation")

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs.as_array for block in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the function iterates through the data blocks, aggregates them, and appends the results to `agg_blocks`. The exception handling has been simplified, and the logic for resetting the locs in the blocks has been improved. Additionally, some unnecessary variables and duplicated logic have been removed to streamline the function.
