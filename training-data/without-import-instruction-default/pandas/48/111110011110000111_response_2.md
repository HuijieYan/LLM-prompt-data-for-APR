The cause of the bug is related to the safe casting of values when using the `dtype='Int64'` in the DataFrame. When calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, it results in a TypeError due to the inability to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

To fix the bug, the safe casting of values needs to be handled properly in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data._astype('float64', copy=False)
        
    # rest of the code remains the same
```

By using the `_astype` method with 'float64' in the `numeric_only` condition, we can safely cast the values to the float64 dtype, allowing the mean, median, and var functions to work properly without resulting in a TypeError.

With this correction, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test case should pass.
