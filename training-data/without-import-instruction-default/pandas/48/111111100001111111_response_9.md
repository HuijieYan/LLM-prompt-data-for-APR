The error in the code seems to be related to the use of the nullable integer data type ('Int64') in the DataFrame. The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks`, which is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It seems that the function is unable to handle the nullable integer data type when performing the mean operation, resulting in a TypeError.

The issue on GitHub also provides information about the expected output and the versions of pandas and other relevant libraries being used.

It appears that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not handling the nullable integer data type ('Int64') correctly when performing the mean operation within the groupby process. This is likely causing the TypeError and leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to handle the nullable integer data type appropriately when performing the mean operation. This may involve checking for null values and handling them in a way that allows the mean operation to proceed without raising a TypeError.

Here's a corrected version of the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = block.values.mean(skipna=True)  # Handle nullable integer data type
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        agg_items = data.items
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the nullable integer data type appropriately when calculating the mean, allowing the operation to proceed without raising a TypeError.

By making these changes, the function should now be able to handle the nullable integer data type ('Int64') correctly when performing the mean operation within the groupby process, thereby resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
