The buggy function seems to be attempting to aggregate data using the `how` parameter in some way. However, it appears that the code is not handling the aggregation correctly, as the resulting `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` do not match the expected output based on the input parameters.

The root cause of the bug may lie in the way the function is attempting to aggregate the data, as well as potential issues in handling exceptions and processing the results of the aggregation.

To fix the bug, it might be necessary to review the aggregation logic and ensure that it properly handles different aggregation methods based on the `how` parameter. Additionally, handling exceptions and error cases more effectively can help improve the function's reliability.

Here's a corrected version of the function that attempts to address these potential issues:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # The following code snippet aims to handle different aggregation methods based on the 'how' parameter
        if how == 'mean':
            result = block.mean()
        elif how == 'median':
            result = block.median()
        elif how == 'var':
            result = block.var()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid 'how' parameter")

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # The rest of the code to manage new_items, deleted_items, split_items, etc. can remain unchanged
    
    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected version attempts to address the potential issues with aggregation and introduces a more succinct approach to handle different aggregation methods based on the `how` parameter. It also aims to simplify the function's logic for better readability and reliability.
