The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the groupby functionality in pandas. The failing test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` is testing the behavior of applying aggregation functions to a DataFrame with nullable integer dtype. The error message indicates a casting issue in converting values from float64 to int64.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `safe_cast` function, particularly the line `return values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to cast float64 values to int64 using the `astype` method with the `casting` parameter set to "safe". This results in a TypeError because the rule 'safe' doesn't allow casting from float64 to int64.

To fix the bug, the casting approach needs to be modified. One possible approach is to handle nullable integer values explicitly and ensure that the casting is done according to the nullable integer dtype requirements.

Below is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code...

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code...

        if result is not no_result:
            # Add a check for nullable integer dtype and cast appropriately
            if is_integer_dtype(result) and result.hasnans:  # Check for nullable integer dtype
                result = result.astype("Int64")  # Cast to nullable integer dtype
            else:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # Existing code...

    # Existing code...
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to first identify if the result is a nullable integer dtype with NaN values. If so, it explicitly casts the result to the "Int64" dtype. Otherwise, it proceeds with the existing downcast approach.

By handling the casting of nullable integer values explicitly, the corrected function should pass the failing test without the casting error.
