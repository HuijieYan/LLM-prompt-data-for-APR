The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the failing test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float`.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by attempting to cast an array from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe' in the `safe_cast` function. This is triggered while running the `median` or `var` functions.

The potential error is likely occurring in the part of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where it is attempting to cast the values to the original `dtype`.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the casting of values to `int64` is handled correctly, especially when dealing with nullable integer types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.mgr_locs.isnanany():  # Check for NaN values
                result = result.astype('float64')  # Convert to float64 if NaN values are present

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # ... (remaining code also remains unchanged) ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for NaN values in the `mgr_locs` array and converted the result to `float64` if NaN values are present. This should handle the issue with casting from `float64` to `int64` and ensure the function passes the failing test.
