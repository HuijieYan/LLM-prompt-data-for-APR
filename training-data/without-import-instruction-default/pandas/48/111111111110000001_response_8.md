Based on the failing test and the error message, the issue seems to be related to the type casting between float and int. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to cast float64 to int64, which is not possible according to the 'safe' rule.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the type casting of values from float64 to int64.

The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` within the DataFrameGroupBy class, and it seems that the issue is with the type casting of values.

To fix the bug, the type casting from float64 to int64 needs to be handled appropriately. This can be done by ensuring that the values are appropriately handled and casted based on conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
        # handling the type casting from float64 to int64
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # handle type casting from float64 to int64
            if block.dtype == np.int64 and result.dtype == np.float64:
                # Perform type casting only if it's safe
                result = result.astype(np.int64, errors='ignore')

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (remaining part of the function remains unchanged)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the type casting from float64 to int64 is handled using the `astype` method with the `errors='ignore'` parameter to ensure the casting is performed only if it's safe.

By making these modifications, the corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the type casting issue.
