Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the loop where the `aggregate` function is called from the `grouper`. The exception handling and conditioning within this loop suggests that this is the part responsible for potential bugs.

Cause of the bug:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of exceptions when calling the `aggregate` function from the `grouper`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the exception handling within the loop to ensure that all scenarios are properly addressed and no unexpected exceptions are left unhandled.
2. Check the conditional statements to ensure they are accurately capturing the intended logic.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if alt is not None and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
            continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # Adjust the indexer to account for the items removed
        indexer = np.delete(indexer, np.concatenate(deleted_items))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
This corrected code simplifies the exception handling within the loop and also ensures that the conditional statements accurately capture the intended logic.
