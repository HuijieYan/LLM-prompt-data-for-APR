The buggy function is not handling the "how" parameter properly, resulting in incorrect aggregation of data. The function is also not effectively handling the "numeric_only" parameter as the aggregation results are inconsistent with the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the "how" parameter is being utilized correctly for the aggregation process. Additionally, the "numeric_only" parameter must be respected to ensure that only numeric data is aggregated, as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        values = block.values
        if is_numeric_dtype(values):
            result = values.agg(func=how, axis=0, min_count=min_count)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)
        else:
            deleted_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    ...
    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, we are directly using the `agg` method on the numeric data and building the aggregated blocks based on the result. Additionally, non-numeric data is correctly handled by adding their locations to the `deleted_items` list.

This should ensure that the function properly aggregates the data based on the "how" parameter and respects the "numeric_only" flag.
