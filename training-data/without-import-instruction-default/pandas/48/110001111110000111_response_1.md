The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be causing a TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64. This is likely the cause of the failing tests and the reported issue on GitHub.

To fix this bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to handle the casting of float64 values to int64 in a safe manner, ensuring that the values are equivalent before performing the cast.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    agg_items = data.items
    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def _aggregate_block(self, block, how, alt, min_count):
    if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype) and block.values.dtype == np.float64:
        result = block.values.astype('float')
    else:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
    return block.make_block(result)

```

In the corrected version of the code, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function now delegates the aggregation of individual blocks to a new helper function `_aggregate_block`. Inside `_aggregate_block`, we specifically handle the case where the block dtype is `pd.Int64Dtype` and the values dtype is `np.float64`. In this case, we explicitly cast the values to float instead of int, ensuring a safe conversion.

By making these changes, the corrected code should now handle the casting of float64 to int64 values in a safe and appropriate manner, resolving the TypeError issue and passing the failing tests. It also addresses the reported issue on GitHub related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
