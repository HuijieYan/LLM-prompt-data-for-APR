The error seems to be related to the casting of values from float to int within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This is causing a TypeError to be raised when trying to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

The root cause of the bug is likely the mismatch between the expected dtype of the values and their actual dtype during the aggregation process.

To fix this bug:
1. Change the dtype of the values in the DataFrame to 'float' instead of 'Int64' before performing the aggregation.
2. Conditionally handle the dtype of the values during the aggregation process based on the desired dtype using the `numeric_only` parameter.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address this issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # aggregation process
        result = block.values._agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only)

        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `convert_dtypes` function is used to convert the values to the appropriate dtypes based on their nature (e.g., converting 'Int64' to 'float').
- The `_agg` function is a hypothetical function that performs the aggregation based on the specified parameters, including the `numeric_only` flag.

With these changes, the corrected function should handle the casting of different dtypes during the aggregation process and resolve the TypeError issue.

This approach ensures that the DataFrame's values are appropriately handled for aggregation, regardless of their dtype, and should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
