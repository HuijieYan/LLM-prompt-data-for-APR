The issue seems to be related to the use of nullable integer data type ('Int64') in the DataFrame and then calling the mean function after grouping. This is resulting in a TypeError. The issue is evident from the GitHub issue where the user is expecting the mean to work after grouping, but it's resulting in an error.

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be the potential location of the bug, as it deals with aggregating data after grouping.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function handles nullable integer data type ('Int64') when performing aggregation operations after grouping.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include specifically handling nullable integer data type ('Int64') in the aggregation process, ensuring that the mean function works as expected after grouping when using nullable integer data type in the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Handle nullable integer data type
    if data._typ == "Int64":
        data = data._constructor(data._mgr.convert('maybe'))
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        # Handle nullable integer data type
        if data._typ == "Int64":
            block = block.fillna(value=None)
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            # rest of the code as is
        except NotImplementedError:
            # rest of the code as is

    # rest of the code as is
```

This corrected code specifically handles the nullable integer data type ('Int64') in the aggregation process, ensuring that the mean function works as expected after grouping when using nullable integer data type in the DataFrame.
