The problem occurs when the `how` parameter is set to `'var'`. We need to handle this case properly. Currently, the code only produces output for mean, median, and unknown inputs. Therefore, we will add the variance calculation to the existing code.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the fix for calculating the variance:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    if how == "var":
        result, mask = self.grouper.variance(data.blocks, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
    else:
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            # existing code for mean and median
            # ...

    # ... (remaining code)
```

With this implementation, the function will now correctly handle the calculation of the variance when the `how` parameter is set to `'var'`.
