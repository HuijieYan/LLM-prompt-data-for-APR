The issue seems to be related to calling the `var` method on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. To fix the bug, it is important to revise the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. Here's an updated version of the function that should resolve the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = np.arange(offset, offset + loc)
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this version, we remove the previous handling of `NoImplementedError` and updating `deleted_items`, `split_items`, and `split_frames`. The implementation focuses on aggregating the result from each block directly and then constructing the `agg_block` and appending it to the list.

This refactoring simplifies the code and should resolve the TypeError issue for the mentioned test cases. Try testing the revised function with the provided cases and verify that the bug has been fixed.
