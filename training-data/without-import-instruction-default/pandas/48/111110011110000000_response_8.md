The issue is that the current implementation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is attempting to cast float64 to int64, which is not allowed.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform the aggregation
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        # Create a new block with the aggregated result
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Concatenate the new_items list and reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function loops over the blocks in the data and performs the aggregation on each block separately. Then it creates a new block with the aggregated result and appends it to the `agg_blocks` list. Finally, it concatenates the new items list and resets the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering.

After applying the correction, the function should work correctly when used in the test cases provided.
