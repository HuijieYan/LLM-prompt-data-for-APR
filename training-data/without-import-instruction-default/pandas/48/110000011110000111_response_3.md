This buggy function is causing a TypeError when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64. The problem seems to be related to the block values obtained from the DataFrameGroupBy during aggregation.

The issue seems to be happening in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically in the section where it tries to cast the block values back to the original dtype. There is a check for `maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)` which might be causing the issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the cast operation from float64 to int64 is handled properly. Additionally, handling of the block values and their casting should be reviewed to address the error.

It seems that the use of nullable integer data type 'Int64' is resulting in the casting error. The function needs to handle this data type properly during aggregation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            if block.dtype == 'Int64' and result.dtype == float:
                result = result.astype('float')

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we added a specific check for the 'Int64' dtype and ensured that the result is cast to 'float' if needed.

This correction should address the TypeError caused by the inappropriate casting of non-equivalent float64 values to int64. It should also ensure that the function handles the 'Int64' dtype properly during aggregation.
