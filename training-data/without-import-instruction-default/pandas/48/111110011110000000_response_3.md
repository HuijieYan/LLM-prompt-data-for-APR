The root cause of the errors in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is the inappropriate handling of numeric values. The `safe_cast` function is being called to convert float64 arrays to int64, which is causing a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that fixed handling of numeric values:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ...
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    numeric_blocks = []
    no_numeric_blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        if block._is_numeric:
            numeric_blocks.append(block)
        else:
            no_numeric_blocks.append(block)
    if numeric_only:
        data = BlockManager(numeric_blocks)
    agg_blocks, agg_items, deleted_items = [], [], []
    for block in data.blocks:
       # ...
        result, df = self.grouper.aggregate(block, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        # ...
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
After this correction, the function is expected to handle numeric and non-numeric values properly and avoid the casting issues mentioned in the error messages.
