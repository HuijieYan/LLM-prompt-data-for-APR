Based on the failing test and error message, it seems that the issue is related to the safe casting of values from float64 to int64 within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This error occurs when applying mean, median, or var functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The safe casting error is likely due to the values being float64 and not safely castable to int64. This is in line with the reported issue on GitHub where calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the safe casting adequately when dealing with nullable integer data type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Add a condition to handle safe casting
    if data.dtypes[0].type == np.float64 and "Int" in str(data.dtypes[0]):
        data = data.astype('float64')

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this update, the safe casting issue when applying mean/median/var functions to a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype should be resolved. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug as well.
