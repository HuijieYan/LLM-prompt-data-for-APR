The provided buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` in the DataFrameGroupBy class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The error is triggered when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype.

The cause of the bug seems to be the improper handling of nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations. This is evident from the failing test code and the error message, as well as the detailed description in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data type appropriately during aggregation operations. This may involve implementing special handling for nullable integer data type when calculating mean, median, and variance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform special handling for nullable integer data type
        if is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            result = block.values.astype(float).mean()
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code introduces special handling for nullable integer data type when calculating the aggregation result.

The above code is a hypothetical correction and should be tested thoroughly to ensure it resolves the issue without causing any other problems.

After making this correction, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
