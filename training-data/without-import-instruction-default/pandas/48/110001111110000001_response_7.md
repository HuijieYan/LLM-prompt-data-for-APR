The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` which handles the aggregation of numeric data. The error message indicates a problem with casting from float64 to int64 in the `safe_cast` function, which is causing a `TypeError`.

The issue appears to be related to the conversion of float values to integer values, likely in the process of aggregation. This is likely happening when the function is trying to safely cast values to a specified data type.

To fix this bug, investigate the code path that involves converting float64 to int64 and ensure that the correct data type is used throughout the process. It seems that the bug might be caused by an incorrect datatype being passed around during the aggregation process.

Here is the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Check if numeric_only is set to True
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[int] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform aggregation based on the specified method 'how'
        if how == "mean":
            result = block.values.mean(axis=0, skipna=True)
        elif how == "median":
            result = block.values.median(axis=0, skipna=True)
        elif how == "var":
            result = block.values.var(axis=0, skipna=True)

        # Create a new Block using the aggregated result and add it to the list
        agg_block = Block(result, block.items, block.ref_items)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        agg_items.extend(block.items)

    # Return the aggregated data blocks and items
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code simplifies the aggregation process by directly calling the appropriate aggregation methods (`mean`, `median`, `var`) based on the specified `how`. It then creates new Block objects for each aggregated result and appends them to the `agg_blocks` list. Finally, it returns the aggregated data blocks and items. This code aims to address the issue related to incorrectly casting from float64 to int64 and should pass the failing test.
