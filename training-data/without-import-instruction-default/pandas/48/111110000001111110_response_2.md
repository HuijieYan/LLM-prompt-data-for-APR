Based on the provided runtime values, it seems that the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not properly handling the NaN values in the DataFrame causing a TypeError when attempting to calculate the mean, median, or standard deviation for numeric-only columns. To fix this, we can modify the function to handle NaN values appropriately. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# this is the corrected and updated function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.dropna().get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # handling the case where result is empty
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reorder the aggregated blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected implementation, we handle the NaN values by using the `dropna()` method to remove any rows with NaN values before performing the aggregation. This approach ensures that the calculations for mean, median, and standard deviation are performed correctly without raising a TypeError due to NaN values.

Please note that the exact changes in the `aggregate` method and `_get_data_to_aggregate` method are omitted as per the given instructions.

This corrected function should address the TypeError issues encountered when using mean, median, or var for numeric-only columns, as described in the GitHub issue.
