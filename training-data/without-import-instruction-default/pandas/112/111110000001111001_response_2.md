The bug in the code is within the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is intended to return an indexer based on the comparison between the `self` IntervalIndex and the `target` IntervalIndex. However, there are several issues in the code that are causing it to fail.

The main issue is that the condition `if self.is_overlapping` is incorrectly used. `self.is_overlapping` should be called as a method `self.is_overlapping()`. Additionally, the comparison operators for `self.equals(target_as_index)` and `self.closed != target_as_index.closed` are not being used correctly.

To fix the bug, the `self.is_overlapping` condition needs to be called as a method. Then, the comparisons for `self.equals(target_as_index)` and `self.closed != target_as_index.closed` should be modified to properly compare the values of the properties.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index) and self.closed == target_as_index.closed:
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        # The rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
```

With these changes, the `get_indexer` function should now properly handle the comparison between the `self` and `target` IntervalIndex objects and return the correct indexer based on the conditions.
