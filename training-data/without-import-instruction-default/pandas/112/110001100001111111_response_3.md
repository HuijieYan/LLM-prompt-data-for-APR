The issue appears to stem from the `get_indexer` function not correctly handling the case where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This causes the `round` method to fail when applied to a dataframe with such columns.

The bug in the function seems to be related to the conditional checks for the type of `target` and the subsequent actions taken based on that. The function is not properly handling the case where `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

The GitHub issue further confirms that the `round` method fails when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`, which aligns with the identified issue in the `get_indexer` function.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function should be modified to correctly handle the case where `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly check for the type of `target` and handle the `CategoricalIndex` case separately.

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case where target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex
        target_values = target.categories
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_values)
    else:
        # handle the remaining cases as before
        ...
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This modified function explicitly checks if the `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` containing categories of type `IntervalIndex`, and handles this case separately by getting the indexer using the `_engine` attribute. This should resolve the issue and allow the `round` method to work as expected.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        # Handle the case where target is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex
        target_values = target.categories
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_values)
    else:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # remaining code as before ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
``` 

This corrected code should successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and handle the case where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
