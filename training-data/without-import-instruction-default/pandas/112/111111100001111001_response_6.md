The potential error in the buggy function lies in the block of code that checks for overlapping indices and handles different types of target indices. The function seems to mishandle the case where the target index is the same as the self index, resulting in incorrect return values.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of matching intervals and possibly incorrect comparison logic for left and right indexes. There might also be issues with how the function handles different types of target indices.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Review the logic for handling the case where the target index is the same as the self index and ensure that it returns the correct positional match array.
2. Double-check the comparison logic for left and right indexes to ensure that it accurately identifies matching intervals.
3. Verify the logic for handling different types of target indices to ensure that the function behaves appropriately for each case.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function based on the identified issues and potential fixes:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.equals(ensure_index(target)):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # logic for handling different types of target indices
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or self.dtype.subtype != target_as_index.dtype.subtype:
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
            
            # logic for identifying matching intervals
            indexer = np.where((self.left == target_as_index.left) & (self.right == target_as_index.right), self.left, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self.values else -1 for key in target_as_index])
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected code addresses the identified issues by ensuring that matching intervals are correctly identified, and that different types of target indices are handled appropriately. It also includes the necessary checks and comparisons to avoid discrepancies in the return values, which should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
