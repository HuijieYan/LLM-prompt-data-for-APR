The buggy function is `get_indexer` inside the class `IntervalIndex`. The function is failing when dealing with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, causing the `round` method to fail.

The potential error location is when the function tries to handle a heterogeneous scalar index, as it is deferring elementwise to the `get_loc` function. This part of the code might not be properly handling the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the function's inability to properly handle a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The `get_indexer` function is not equipped to handle this specific scenario, leading to the `round` method failure. The GitHub issue also confirms this behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle the CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly. It needs to account for this specific type of index and perform the necessary actions to ensure that the `round` method works as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex(target)  # Convert to IntervalIndex
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
    else:
        indexer = target_as_index.values.searchsorted(self, side='right')
        
    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This updated code includes a specific condition for handling a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. It converts the CategoricalIndex to an IntervalIndex and then performs the necessary operations to ensure that the `round` method works as expected.

This correction should address the bug and ensure that the `round` method functions properly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
