The bug is caused by the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. It seems that the method does not handle the case where the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly. This is causing the `round` method to fail when the columns are of this type.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Modifying the `get_indexer` method to handle the case of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly.
2. Ensuring that the method has a matching signature for the input argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class:

```python
# Other functions and class declarations remain unchanged

    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target._index, IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = target._codes.astype('int64')
        else:
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # remaining code remains unchanged
        # remaining code remains unchanged
```

This corrected code should handle the case where the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` correctly and should pass the failing test. Additionally, it resolves the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the `round` method works as expected in this scenario.
