The issue is occurring because the `get_indexer` method is expecting a scalar target, but it's receiving an `IntervalIndex` as the target. To fix this issue, we need to modify the implementation of the `get_indexer` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # raise error for IntervalIndex due to mismatch in signatures
        msg = ("No matching signature found")
        raise TypeError(msg)

    # Rest of the implementation remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we added the `()` after `self.is_overlapping` to call the method and check if it's overlapping. Additionally, we handle the case where `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` by raising a `TypeError` with an appropriate message.

This modification should resolve the issue and allow the `round` method to work as expected when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
