The issue is caused by the `df.round()` method failing when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The failure occurs due to a `TypeError: No matching signature found` within the `get_indexer` function.

The `get_indexer` function is expecting a scalar target, but in the failing case, it receives a `values` attribute, causing a type error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` function to handle the scenario where it receives a `values` attribute as input. We also need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method is prepared to handle both scalar and array-like target inputs.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: scalar_t[:] | AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target, np.ndarray):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index([target])

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This modified `get_indexer` function handles both scalar and array-like target inputs and ensures that the `TypeError: No matching signature found` issue is resolved.

With this corrected code, the failing test case should pass, and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the `round` method failing when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.
