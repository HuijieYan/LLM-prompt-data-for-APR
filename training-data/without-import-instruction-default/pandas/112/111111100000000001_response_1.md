1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is part of the class `IntervalIndex`. The function is trying to implement logic for getting the indexer for a target index based on various conditions. It calls several related functions in the process, such as `left`, `right`, `is_overlapping`, `equals`, `get_loc`, etc.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional logic for handling different types of index targets and the computation of the indexer.

3. The bug's cause may be due to incorrect conditional logic for handling different types of index targets and the computation of the indexer. Additionally, there might be inconsistencies in calling related functions.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be:
   - Reviewing the conditional logic to ensure it covers all relevant cases.
   - Ensuring that the related functions are called consistently and with the correct parameters.
   - Verifying that the computation of the indexer follows the intended logic for different target index types.

5. Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# Importing necessary modules
from pandas._typing import AnyArrayLike

# Code for the corrected get_indexer function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        elif self.closed != target_as_index.closed:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `is_overlapping` function is called correctly as `self.is_overlapping()`.
- The related functions `left`, `right`, and `get_loc` are called with appropriate parentheses for method invocation.
- The conditional logic for handling different types of index targets is modified to ensure correct processing.
