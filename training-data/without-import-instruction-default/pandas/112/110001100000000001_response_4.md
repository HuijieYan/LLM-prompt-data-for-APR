The buggy function is a method called get_indexer from the IntervalIndex class in the pandas library. This method seems to be returning incorrect values for the indexer when dealing with different types of indexes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks for different types of indexes (IntervalIndex and scalar indexes). It seems that the logic for handling different types of indexes is incorrect, leading to the incorrect values being returned for the indexer.

The bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of different index types within the conditional statements, leading to the incorrect calculation of the indexer values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and correct the conditional statements and logic for handling different types of indexes.
2. Update the conditional statements to ensure proper handling of IntervalIndex and scalar indexes.
3. Test the function with different types of indexes to ensure that the correct indexer values are being returned.

Here's the corrected code for the get_indexer function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

    # other cases for handling scalar indexes
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(np.array(indexer))
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement handling different index types has been simplified to properly handle IntervalIndex and scalar indexes. The logic for returning the correct indexer values has been updated to address the original bug.
