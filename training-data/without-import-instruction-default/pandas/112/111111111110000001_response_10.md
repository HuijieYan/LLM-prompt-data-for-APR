**Analysis:**

The buggy function is a method within the `IntervalIndex` class from the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. This method is called `get_indexer` and is responsible for returning the index of the target values within the index.

The failing test `test_round_interval_category_columns` creates a DataFrame with columns of type `pd.CategoricalIndex` and then attempts to round the DataFrame. This leads to the invocation of the `get_indexer` method, which eventually raises a `TypeError: No matching signature found` error.

**Bug Cause:**

The error is likely due to an issue with the input arguments of the `get_indexer` method. It seems that the method signature or input type is causing a conflict, leading to the `No matching signature found` error.

**Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:**

1. Check and ensure that the input arguments of the `get_indexer` method are of the correct type and format.
2. Verify that the method signature matches the type and format of the input arguments provided in the failing test and ensure compatibility.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
# corrected get_indexer method
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: Any,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
    else:
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

The corrected code modifies the method signature of the `get_indexer` method to ensure compatibility with the input arguments. Additionally, it calls `self.is_overlapping()` instead of `self.is_overlapping` to properly invoke the method. These changes should address the `No matching signature found` error and allow the method to pass the failing test.
