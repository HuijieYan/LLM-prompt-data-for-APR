The buggy function is a method called `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. It takes several input parameters and performs operations based on the attributes of the `IntervalIndex` class, such as `is_overlapping`, `left`, `right`, and `dtype`. The function is intended to return an array of indexers based on the target input.

Upon analysis, it is evident that the function encounters a bug due to the comparison of the `self.is_overlapping` attribute, which is never actually called as a method (i.e., `self.is_overlapping()` is missing the parentheses). This causes the condition `if self.is_overlapping:` to always evaluate as `True`, resulting in an error being raised, even if it should not be. Additionally, the return statement for non-object data types seems to be incorrect.

The bug's cause is due to the incorrect usage of the `is_overlapping` attribute and mistakes in the logic and conditionals of the function.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Ensure that the `is_overlapping` attribute is correctly invoked as a method to obtain a boolean value for comparison.
2. Review the logic and conditionals to correctly handle the `is_overlapping` attribute and ensure that the return statements are valid for different data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function based on the identified bug:

```python
def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
            # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
            common_subtype = find_common_type(
                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    
            # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        else:
            if is_scalar(target_as_index):
                target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index)
            
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the `is_overlapping` attribute is correctly invoked as `self.is_overlapping()`, and the logic and conditionals have been adjusted to handle different data types and scenarios appropriately. This should address the identified bug and ensure the function behaves as intended.
