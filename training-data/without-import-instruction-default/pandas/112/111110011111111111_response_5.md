The bug is likely located in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found, suggesting an issue within the signature of the function. The failing test involves using `pd.CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, and when the `round` method is called on the DataFrame, the TypeError occurs. This suggests that the issue is related to the handling of CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex.

The expected output is for the `round` method to work normally, even when columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. However, due to the bug in the `get_indexer` function, this is not currently the case.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function should be updated to handle the case where the target is a CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex. This may involve revisiting how the `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` classes interact, and ensuring that the appropriate indexing and conversion methods are used.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # handle IntervalIndex as before
        # ...
    else:
        # handle other index types
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code, we account for the case where the target is a `pd.CategoricalIndex` by converting it back to an `IntervalIndex` before continuing with the indexing process. This change should address the TypeError that occurs when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with CategoricalIndex derived from an IntervalIndex.
