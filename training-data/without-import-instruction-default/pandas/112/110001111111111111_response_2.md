The buggy function is a method called "get_indexer" in the pandas library's "IntervalIndex" class. The error occurs when the method is called by the DataFrame's "round" method for a DataFrame with an IntervalIndex CategoricalIndex column.

The error message indicates a TypeError, specifically "No matching signature found", which suggests a problem with the function signature or the input types. This is likely occurring at the line where the method "_engine.get_indexer" is being called with "target_as_index.values" as an argument.

The function uses various attributes and methods related to the "IntervalIndex" class such as "is_overlapping", "left", "right", and "_engine.get_indexer". It also checks for equality with "target_as_index" before proceeding to different code paths based on the type of "target_as_index".

Based on the error message and the input parameter values, it seems that the problem lies in the way "target_as_index.values" is being handled when passed to "_engine.get_indexer".

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to handle the scenario where "target_as_index.values" is sent to "_engine.get_indexer" differently. This may involve converting "target_as_index.values" to a different type or using a different method altogether.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories  # Extract categories if CategoricalIndex

        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # Handle other cases where target_as_index is not an IntervalIndex
        # ...
```

In the corrected code, if the "target_as_index" is a CategoricalIndex, we extract its categories and pass them to "_engine.get_indexer" for further processing. This should resolve the issue and make the function work correctly in the context of the failing test and the GitHub issue.
