1. The buggy function is a method `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas.core.indexes.interval` module. This function is responsible for returning the integer index related to the input target array-like values. It checks for overlapping indices and performs different operations based on the type of the input target.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be around the condition `if self.is_overlapping:`. This condition checks for overlapping indices and raises an `InvalidIndexError` if there are overlapping indices.

3. The buggy function has several issues:
   (a). The `if self.is_overlapping:` condition is problematic as it seems to check for the existence of the method `is_overlapping` rather than calling the method and checking its result.
   (b). There are potential issues with the logic surrounding the handling of different types of indexes and finding common subtypes.
   (c). The handling of homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes appears to be incorrect.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Correctly calling the `is_overlapping` method to check for overlapping indices.
   (b). Reviewing the logic related to index type handling and finding common subtypes.
   (c). Revisiting the logic for handling homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes to ensure correct behavior.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "Cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `is_overlapping` method is correctly called as `self.is_overlapping()` to check for overlapping indices.
- The logic for handling different types of indexes is revised to address potential issues with finding common subtypes and handling homogeneous and heterogeneous scalar indexes.
