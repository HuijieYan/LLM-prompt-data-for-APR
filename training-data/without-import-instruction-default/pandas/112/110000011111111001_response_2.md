The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the use of the `_engine.get_indexer` method with incorrect input argument types, causing a `TypeError` leading to a failure in the `test_round_interval_category_columns` test.

The failing error message indicates that a `TypeError` is being raised, specifically stating "No matching signature found" when the `get_indexer` method is called on the `_engine` object.

This issue seems to be rooted in the usage of the `get_indexer` method, as it's not being passed the correct argument types or structure. It is likely that the `target_as_index` is not being processed correctly before passing it to the `_engine.get_indexer` method.

To fix this issue, the approach would be to ensure that the input to the `get_indexer` method is properly formatted. This might involve converting the `target_as_index` to the appropriate format before passing it to the `_engine.get_indexer` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Process target_as_index before passing it to _engine.get_indexer
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index.values)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have explicitly processed the `target_as_index` before passing it to the `_engine.get_indexer` method, ensuring that it's in the correct format for the method to handle. This should address the `TypeError` issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
