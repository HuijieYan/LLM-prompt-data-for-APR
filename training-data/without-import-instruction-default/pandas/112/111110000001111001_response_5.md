The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block of code that handles the case when isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex). The condition for checking if self.is_overlapping is True or False is incorrect, as it should be a method call self.is_overlapping() instead of just self.is_overlapping.

The bug's cause is that the condition self.is_overlapping is always evaluated as True, which leads to the incorrect execution of the subsequent code block. This discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable value causes the function to raise an InvalidIndexError.

To fix the bug, the self.is_overlapping condition should be correctly called as a method, and the subsequent code block should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Correctly calling the method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    else:
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

```
