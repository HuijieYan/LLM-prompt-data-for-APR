The buggy function is the get_indexer method in the pandas core indexes interval.py file. The failing test test_round_interval_category_columns in the pandas test file test_analytics.py is expecting the round method to work with a DataFrame that has columns as a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. However, it is currently failing with a TypeError: No matching signature found.

The problematic part of the code is the line where the get_indexer method is called with the target_as_index.values parameter. This is where the TypeError is being raised.

The GitHub issue indicates that the round method fails whenever the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and it is expected to round as normal.

To fix the bug, we need to update the get_indexer method to handle the case where the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. We need to ensure that the rounding works as expected in this scenario.

Here is the corrected code for the get_indexer method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        elif self.closed != target_as_index.closed:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    else:
        indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this corrected code, the get_indexer method should now handle the case where the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex and the round method should work as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
