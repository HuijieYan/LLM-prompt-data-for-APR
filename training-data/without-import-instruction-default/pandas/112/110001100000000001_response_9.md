Analysis:
The buggy function is `get_indexer` which is from the same file as several related functions that it calls throughout its body.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where it handles `target_as_index` that is an instance of `IntervalIndex`.

Bug Cause:
The bug in the `get_indexer` function might be caused by the mishandling of the `target_as_index` that is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. This could lead to incorrect indexing and therefore incorrect results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the handling of `target_as_index` of type `IntervalIndex` is done correctly.
2. Verify that the comparisons and indexing logic are accurate and functioning as expected.
3. Double check the calls to related functions such as `left`, `right`, `dtype`, etc. to ensure they are returning the expected values.

Corrected Code:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            # Handle the case where target_as_index is an IntervalIndex
            indexer = np.where(
                (self.left == target_as_index.left) & (self.right == target_as_index.right),
                self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left),
                -1
            )
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the condition to check for overlapping indices has been fixed by calling the `is_overlapping` function. Additionally, the logic for handling `target_as_index` of type `IntervalIndex` has been revised to ensure correct indexing and matching. The related functions such as `left`, `right`, `get_loc` have been used in an appropriate manner within the revised logic of the `get_indexer` function.
