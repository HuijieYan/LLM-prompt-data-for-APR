1. The buggy function is a method called get_indexer, which is part of the IntervalIndex class in the pandas library. This function is responsible for returning the indices of the target array within the IntervalIndex.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the logic used to handle different scenarios when the target array is compared with the IntervalIndex.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is attempting to handle different scenarios when comparing the target array with the IntervalIndex. However, the logic for handling these scenarios is not implemented correctly, leading to potential issues.
   (b). The related functions are left, right, is_overlapping, equals, _maybe_convert_i8, and get_loc. These functions are all called within the buggy function to handle various cases for comparing the target array with the IntervalIndex.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Review and revise the logic for handling different scenarios when comparing the target array with the IntervalIndex.
   (b). Ensure that the related functions are used appropriately and that their return values are handled correctly within the buggy function.
   (c). Test the function with different input scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the is_overlapping function to check for overlapping indices
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the is_overlapping function is called with parenthesis to check for overlapping indices. The logic for handling different scenarios when comparing the target array with the IntervalIndex has been revised to ensure correct behavior. Additionally, the related functions are used appropriately, and their return values are handled correctly within the function.
