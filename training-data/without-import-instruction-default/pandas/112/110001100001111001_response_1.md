The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be related to the way it handles the `target_as_index` variable when it is an instance of `IntervalIndex`. The function attempts to compare the `self` interval index with the `target_as_index` interval index, and based on the comparison, it tries to return the appropriate indexer.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the function checks for overlapping indices using `if self.is_overlapping:`. It incorrectly checks for overlapping by using `self.is_overlapping` as a property, which results in always entering the block of code for overlapping indices.

The bug's cause can be attributed to the use of `self.is_overlapping` as a property instead of calling the `is_overlapping` function. This causes the condition to always evaluate to True, leading to the wrong path being taken in the subsequent code execution.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_overlapping` function is being called to check for overlapping indices and return the correct logic based on the result.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the is_overlapping function
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Logic for interval index comparison
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this correction, the `is_overlapping` function is correctly invoked as a method to check for overlapping indices, and the subsequent logic in the function will execute based on the correct evaluation of the condition.
