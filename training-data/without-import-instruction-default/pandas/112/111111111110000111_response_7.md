The bug in the function `get_indexer` is likely to be caused by the line `indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)`, where `self._engine` is called without being initialized.

The bug seems to be related to the fact that when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, the `get_indexer` method fails to find a matching signature, resulting in a TypeError. This is evidenced by the error message from the failing test, where the `get_indexer` method is called with a `scalar_t` target that does not have a matching signature, leading to a TypeError. The GitHub issue further confirms this behavior by stating that the `round` method fails specifically when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `self._engine` is properly initialized before calling its `get_indexer` method. We also need to handle the case where the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, ensuring that appropriate signatures are used for the `get_indexer` method.

The corrected code for the problematic function `get_indexer` is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # Handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    # ...existing code continues...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we specifically handle the case where the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex by checking if the `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex` within a `CategoricalIndex`. If it is, we create an indexer with appropriate values to handle this scenario. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
