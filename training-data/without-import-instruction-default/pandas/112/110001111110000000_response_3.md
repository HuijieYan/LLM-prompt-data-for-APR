The issue in the function is that the `get_indexer` method is being re-implemented, which is causing a conflict with the existing method in the class. To fix the bug, you should remove the re-implementation of the `get_indexer` method and retain only the method to be called from within the class.

Here's the corrected version of the function after removing the re-implementation:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Call the existing get_indexer method here
    indexer = self._get_indexer(target_as_index, method, limit, tolerance)

    return indexer
```

With this correction, the function should no longer conflict with the existing method, and the failing test should pass without the TypeError.
