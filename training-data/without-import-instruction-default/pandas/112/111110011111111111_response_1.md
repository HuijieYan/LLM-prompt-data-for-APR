Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug is occurring due to a TypeError being raised inside the `get_indexer` method. This method is being called by the `round` method when the columns are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

The potential error location is within the `get_indexer` method as it fails to find a matching signature for the input. This indicates that there might be an issue with the method's implementation and its compatibility with the input columns.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a). The buggy function: The `get_indexer` method is failing to find a matching signature for the input, resulting in a TypeError.
(b). The buggy class: The `IntervalIndex` class contains the `get_indexer` method, and it appears that there may be an issue with the compatibility of the input columns with this method.
(c). The failing test and error message: The failing test attempts to round a DataFrame with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex`, which triggers the TypeError.
(d). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value: The `get_indexer` method is unable to handle the input columns, leading to a mismatch.
(e). The GitHub Issue information: The issue describes the exact problem observed, which is the failure of the `round` method when `CategoricalIndex` columns are created from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex` without raising a TypeError. This may involve making adjustments to the method's implementation to properly handle this specific case.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    else:
        return super(IntervalIndex, self).get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

With this corrected code, the `get_indexer` method should be able to handle `CategoricalIndex` columns created from an `IntervalIndex` without raising a TypeError. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post and allow the failing test to pass.
