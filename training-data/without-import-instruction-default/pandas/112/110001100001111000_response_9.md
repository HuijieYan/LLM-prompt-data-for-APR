The buggy function is a duplicate of the get_indexer method from the same file. To fix the issue, we need to remove the duplicate definition of the get_indexer method and make sure it is only defined once in the file.

To correct the code, we can remove the duplicate definition of the get_indexer method and make sure it is not defined again. After removing the duplicate definition, the corrected code will be as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/interval.py

# other functions...

# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    # existing code for this function
    # ...
```

By removing the duplicate definition of the get_indexer method, the issue should be resolved and the code should function as intended.
