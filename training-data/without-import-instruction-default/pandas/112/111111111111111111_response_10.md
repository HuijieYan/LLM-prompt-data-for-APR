The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex created from an `IntervalIndex`.

The issue seems to be related to the method's inability to find a matching signature for the given input, leading to a TypeError. The failing test demonstrates that the `round()` method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, we first need to identify the root cause of the failure. Looking at the failing test and the error message, it seems that the issue arises when the `get_indexer` method is called with a target that contains a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex.

One potential approach for fixing the bug could be to modify the `get_indexer` method to handle the case where the target contains a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. This might involve updating the method to properly handle the input and provide a matching signature.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Updated to properly handle when the target contains CategoricalIndex from an IntervalIndex
            # rest of the code remains unchanged
            # ...
            # <existing implementation>
            # ...
        
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
By updating the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the case where the target contains a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex, the bug should be fixed. This fix will allow the `round` method to work as expected when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
