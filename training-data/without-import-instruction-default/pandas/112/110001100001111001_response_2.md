The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that deals with the comparison of IntervalIndexes and the creation of the indexer variable. This section is trying to handle different cases for the comparison and conversion of indexes, but it seems to be handling some cases incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug's cause seems to be an issue with the comparison and conversion of the IntervalIndexes. The function is not accurately handling cases where the indexes are equal, have different closed values, or are non-overlapping.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring that the comparison of IntervalIndexes and the creation of the indexer variable is handling all cases accurately and effectively.
2. Making sure that the function is correctly identifying equal indexes, handling different closed values, and managing non-overlapping cases.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = "Cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_closed = self.closed == target_as_index.closed
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if common_closed and not is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        else:
            indexer = np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected code handles the comparison and indexing cases for IntervalIndexes accurately, ensuring that it satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
