The buggy function `get_indexer` is failing to handle the case when the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This failure is also reflected in the GitHub issue, where calling the `round()` method on a DataFrame with columns as `CategoricalIndex` created from `IntervalIndex` fails.

The potential error location within the function is likely the part that handles the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`. Since the function is not specifically designed to handle this case, it leads to an error and the failure in the GitHub issue.

The cause of the bug is that the function `get_indexer` does not have specific logic to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`. This leads to a TypeError when it tries to process the input.

To fix the bug, we need to add a specific condition to handle the case when `target_as_index` is a `CategoricalIndex`. We can then implement the appropriate logic to process the input in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # New condition to handle CategoricalIndex
    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target.categories
    else:
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the function now explicitly handles the case when `target` is a `CategoricalIndex`. This change should address the error and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
