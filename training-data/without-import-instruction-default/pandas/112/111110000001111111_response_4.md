The issue here seems to be with the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The method is not handling the case when the input `target` is a `pd.CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This is causing the `round` method to fail when using a DataFrame with such columns.

The potential error location is within the `get_indexer` method where it is not handling the case for `pd.CategoricalIndex`.

The bug's cause is that the `get_indexer` method does not consider the possibility of the input `target` being a `pd.CategoricalIndex` derived from an `IntervalIndex`. This leads to a failure when using the `round` method.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `get_indexer` method to explicitly handle the case when `target` is a `pd.CategoricalIndex`. We need to add a conditional check to differentiate between `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex` and handle each case accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.IntervalIndex):
        # Existing code as it is
        # ...
    elif isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.dtype, pd.IntervalDtype):
        target_as_index = pd.IntervalIndex.from_intervals(target)
        return self.get_indexer(target_as_index, method, limit, tolerance)
    else:
        # Handle other cases
        # ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to handle the case when `target` is a `pd.CategoricalIndex` and its dtype is `pd.IntervalDtype`. We convert the `CategoricalIndex` to an `IntervalIndex` using `pd.IntervalIndex.from_intervals` and then recursively call the `get_indexer` method with the modified `target_as_index`.

By making this modification, the `get_indexer` method will now handle the case of `CategoricalIndex` derived from `IntervalIndex`, and the `round` method should no longer fail when using such columns in a DataFrame. This fix should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub.
