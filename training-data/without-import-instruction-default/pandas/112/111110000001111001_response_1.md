The bug in the provided function arises from the improper handling of the `is_overlapping` attribute. The function checks if `self.is_overlapping` is True or False, but it should actually call the method `self.is_overlapping()` to get the boolean value.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code in the `get_indexer` function to call the `is_overlapping` method instead of directly accessing the attribute `is_overlapping`. Additionally, we should also ensure that the comparison is made correctly for the condition `if self.is_overlapping()`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        #...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)

```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the `is_overlapping` attribute by calling the method and comparing its boolean value. This will fix the bug and ensure that the function works as expected based on the provided input/output variable information.
