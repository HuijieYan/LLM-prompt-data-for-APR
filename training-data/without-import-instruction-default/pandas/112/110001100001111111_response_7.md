Looking at the provided information and the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem occurs when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This is likely related to the implementation of the `get_indexer` method for IntervalIndex.

The issue appears to be with the logic inside the `get_indexer` function, specifically in the portion where it checks for overlapping indices and handles different types of indexes. The actual output of the function does not match the expected behavior, causing the `round` method to fail when using CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix this bug, the implementation of the `get_indexer` method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the different types of indices, especially when dealing with IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(Interval(key))
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

This corrected implementation should now correctly handle different types of indices, including IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex, and allow the `round` method to work as expected. The GitHub issue should be resolved with this fix.
