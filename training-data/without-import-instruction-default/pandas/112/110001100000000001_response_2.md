The buggy function is a method called get_indexer, which is supposed to return an array of indices that can be used to index into the IntervalIndex. The function makes use of a number of related functions such as _check_method, is_overlapping, ensure_index, find_common_type, and get_loc.

The potential location of the error lies in the section of code that handles the case where the target_as_index is an IntervalIndex. There are conditions and calculations in this section that could potentially lead to incorrect results.

The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of IntervalIndex when comparing and calculating the indexer. The incorrect logic in this section could lead to wrong indexing results being returned.

To fix the bug, the section of code that handles the case where the target_as_index is an IntervalIndex needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially rewritten to ensure that the comparisons and calculations are done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the get_indexer function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

    if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        return self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype='intp')
        for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                indexer[i] = loc
            except KeyError:
                indexer[i] = -1
        return indexer
```

In the corrected code, we have made changes to properly handle the case where target_as_index is an IntervalIndex. We have simplified the logic and used the get_loc function to obtain the correct indexing results. We have also ensured that the is_overlapping function is correctly called as a method.
