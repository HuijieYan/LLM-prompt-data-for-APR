The issue appears to be related to the `round` method failing when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The `CategoricalIndex` is created when the original columns are of type `IntervalIndex`, which can happen when using the `pd.cut` function.

Looking at the `get_indexer` function, the potential error location could be in the handling of the `target_as_index` variable, which represents the input target as an index.

Considering the input and output variable information, we can see that the `target_as_index` variable is expected to be an `IntervalIndex`, with additional attributes such as `dtype`, `closed`, `left`, `right`, and `values`. These attributes are characteristic of `IntervalIndex` objects.

The GitHub issue further highlights the problem with the `round` method failing specifically when the columns are of type `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `get_indexer` function is able to handle cases where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This may involve updating the logic in the function to properly handle these cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        # rest of the logic remains the same
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `target_as_index` is an instance of `CategoricalIndex`. If it is, we extract the original `IntervalIndex` from the `categories` attribute. This allows the function to properly handle cases where the input `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`, as seen in the GitHub issue.

With this correction, the `get_indexer` function should be able to handle the problematic case described in the GitHub issue, and the `round` method should work as expected.
