Analysis:
The buggy function 'get_indexer' seems to be causing a TypeError when trying to round the DataFrame with columns as a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. The failing test is trying to round a DataFrame with columns as a CategoricalIndex of an IntervalIndex, and it is resulting in a TypeError with no matching signature found. The GitHub issue also confirms that the round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the get_indexer method not being able to handle the CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex correctly when the DataFrame is rounded.

Possible Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Modify the get_indexer method to handle CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex correctly.
2. Ensure that the rounding operation works as expected when the DataFrame has columns as a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected code for the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) or isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
        target_as_index = target_as_index.values

    # remaining code as is
    ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With the corrected code, the get_indexer method will now handle CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex correctly, ensuring that the rounding operation works as expected when the DataFrame has columns as a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. This should address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
