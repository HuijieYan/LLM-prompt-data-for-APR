Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be related to the fact that the `round` method does not handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly, leading to a TypeError being raised.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. The method is not handling the conversion of CategoricalIndex from an IntervalIndex properly, leading to the TypeError when trying to use the `round` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `get_indexer` method to properly handle CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex.
2. Make sure that the method returns a compatible output for the `round` method to work with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Corrected code:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):  # Check if the target is a CategoricalIndex
            target_as_index = target_as_index.rename_categories(range(len(target_as_index.categories))).astype('int')
        
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # Code for handling IntervalIndex as before
            # ...
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # Code for handling other types of indexes as before
            # ...
        else:
            # Code for handling heterogeneous scalar index as before
            # ...
```

The corrected code checks if the target is a CategoricalIndex and if so, it converts the categories to integers and updates the `target_as_index` before further processing. This modification should allow the `round` method to work properly with columns that are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The updated method should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub issue and handle the conversion of CategoricalIndex from an IntervalIndex properly.
