The bug is likely located in the `get_indexer` function, as it is failing to handle the rounding method when the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This is consistent with the GitHub issue description, where the `round` method fails when the columns are a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

The cause of the bug is that the `get_indexer` function does not handle the specific case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This leads to a TypeError when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with such columns.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to handle the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This may involve implementing a specific logic to handle this case and ensure that the rounding method works as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected code for the problematic function get_indexer
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) or isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        indexer = np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")  # Handle IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex cases
    else:
        # Handle other cases as before
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this corrected code, the `get_indexer` function now handles the case where the columns are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, ensuring that the rounding method works as expected. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
