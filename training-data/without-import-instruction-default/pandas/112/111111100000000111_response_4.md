1. The buggy function `get_indexer` is part of the `IntervalIndex` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/interval.py` file. The GitHub issue mentions that the `round` method fails when the columns are `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This suggests that the issue may be related to the `get_indexer` function not handling `CategoricalIndex` properly.

2. The potential error location within the `get_indexer` function could be the section where it checks if the target is an `IntervalIndex` and tries to perform operations based on that assumption.

3. The bug's cause can be attributed to how the `get_indexer` function handles different types of indexes and how it interacts with the `CategoricalIndex` type. The `get_indexer` function seems to be assuming the target is always an `IntervalIndex` and performs operations accordingly, which leads to the failure when dealing with a `CategoricalIndex`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking the type of the target index and implementing separate logic for `IntervalIndex` and `CategoricalIndex`.
   - Ensuring that the `get_indexer` function can handle a wider range of index types, including `CategoricalIndex`.
   - Implementing proper error handling and fallback logic in case of unexpected index types.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
[previous code...]

    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex):
            target = target.codes
    
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # rest of the code remains unchanged...

```
In this corrected code, we first check if the target is a `CategoricalIndex` and if so, we convert it to its underlying codes. This ensures that the `get_indexer` function can handle a `CategoricalIndex` properly.
