Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the problematic function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function is supposed to return the index for the target values, but it seems to be failing due to a type error.

The function interacts with several internal methods like `is_overlapping`, `_maybe_convert_i8`, and `_engine`. It also checks the method using `_check_method`. The failing test is trying to call a `round` function on a DataFrame that uses the `get_indexer` method, which eventually leads to a type error.

The possible cause of the bug is the incorrect type signature of the `get_indexer` function. The type signature should receive an array-like object, but it seems to be expecting a scalar object instead, leading to the type error.

To fix this issue, the type signature of the `get_indexer` function should be modified to accept an array-like target instead of a scalar.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    
    self._check_method(method)
    
    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
    else:
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By modifying the type signature and calling `self.is_overlapping()` instead of `self.is_overlapping`, the function should now accept array-like objects and handle the indexing correctly. This correction should resolve the type error and make the failing test pass.
