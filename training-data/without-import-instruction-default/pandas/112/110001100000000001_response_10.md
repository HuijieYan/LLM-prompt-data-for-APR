1. The buggy function is a method named "get_indexer" that is defined in a class within the pandas library. It is related to several other functions within the same file, such as _check_method, is_overlapping, ensure_index, find_common_type, and possibly others. The function is supposed to return an indexer for the given target, based on the intervals defined by the class. 

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic used to calculate the indexer, especially within the conditional blocks where different types of target indexes are handled.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function is trying to handle different cases of target indexes (IntervalIndex, scalar index, etc.) and calculate the indexer accordingly. The conditional logic for handling IntervalIndex and scalar indexes may not be implemented correctly.
   (b). The related functions, especially those related to calculating the indexer for different types of indexes, could be impacting the correct execution of the buggy function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Review the conditional logic for handling different types of target indexes and ensure that the logic for calculating the indexer is implemented correctly for each case.
   (b). Check the related functions to ensure that they are returning the expected values and are being used correctly within the buggy function.
   (c). Debug the function step by step to identify the exact location and cause of the issue.

5. Corrected code:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        common_subtype = find_common_type([self._left, self._right])

        if self.closed() != target_as_index.closed() or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self._left.get_indexer(target_as_index._left)
        right_indexer = self._right.get_indexer(target_as_index._right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

Please note that the corrected code includes modifications to the function calls for is_overlapping, closed, left, right, _left, _right, and _engine. Additionally, some logic changes have been made within the function to address the potential issues that were causing the bug.
