The bug in the `get_indexer` function is likely caused by the use of `self.left.get_indexer` and `self.right.get_indexer` which may not be compatible with the `IntervalIndex` type. This could be the reason for the TypeError when using the `round` method with a DataFrame containing a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex. We can also remove the unnecessary checks for overlapping indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)

    else:
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With this corrected code, the `get_indexer` function should handle the case where the target index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, and the `round` method should work as expected with such columns in a DataFrame.

The GitHub issue related to the bug is titled "round method fails when columns are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex" and describes how the `round` method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The expected output is that the `round` method should work as normal in this scenario.

By making the changes described above, the bug should be resolved and the `round` method should work as expected with columns that are CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.
