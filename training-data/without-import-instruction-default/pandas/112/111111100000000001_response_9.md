The buggy function is a method called `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. This method is supposed to return an indexer array for the target based on the index intervals, but there are problems in the implementation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that handles different types of target indexes. The code attempts to compare the left and right indexes of the intervals, but it is not doing so correctly.

The buggy function is using a complex logic to create the indexer array when dealing with different types of targets, such as `IntervalIndex`, homogeneous scalar index, and heterogeneous scalar index.

To fix the bug:
- The code should be modified to correctly compare the left and right indexes of intervals for the case when the target is an `IntervalIndex`.
- The logic for handling different types of target indexes should be simplified to avoid unnecessary complexity.
- The code should be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
    
        self._check_method(method)
    
        if self.is_overlapping():
            raise NotImplementedError("Overlapping indices are not yet implemented.")
    
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)
    
        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            if not self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.repeat(-1, len(target_as_index))
    
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
        
        for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                indexer[i] = loc
            except KeyError:
                indexer[i] = -1
        
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected code:
- The comparison logic for `IntervalIndex` targets has been simplified to directly compare whether the indexes are equal.
- The complex logic for handling different types of target indexes has been replaced with a more straightforward approach using a loop to handle each target individually.
- The code has been refactored to improve readability and maintainability.
