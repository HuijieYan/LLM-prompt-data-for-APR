The buggy function `get_indexer` is causing a `TypeError` when trying to round a DataFrame that has `pd.CategoricalIndex` with `pd.interval_range` as the columns. This error is occurring at the line `result = df.round()` in the failing test function `test_round_interval_category_columns`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the `get_indexer` method, specifically in the handling of interval indexes. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found, which suggests a mismatch between the types of arguments being passed to the `get_indexer` method and the expected types.

The bug's cause is likely due to the incorrect handling of the interval indexes in the `get_indexer` method, leading to a mismatch between the types of arguments being passed.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to correctly handle interval indexes and ensure that the types of arguments being passed to it are compatible with its expected signature. This may involve adjusting the logic for interval index handling and ensuring that the correct types are used.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `get_indexer`:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.IntervalIndex):
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With these corrections, the `get_indexer` method should handle interval indexes correctly and resolve the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the failing test.
