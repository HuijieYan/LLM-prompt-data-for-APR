The bug is located in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found when trying to call the `_engine.get_indexer` method with `target_as_index.values`. This suggests that there may be an issue with the signature of the `get_indexer` method or with the type of `target_as_index.values`.

The failing test is related to rounding of a DataFrame with columns that are a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. The expected output is for it to round as normal, but currently it fails with a `TypeError`.

This bug is likely caused by an incorrect call to `_engine.get_indexer` or a problem with the type of `target_as_index.values` being incompatible with the method signature.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the call to `_engine.get_indexer` and ensure that the type of `target_as_index.values` matches the expected input for the method.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # existing code remains the same

    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the call to `_engine.get_indexer` has been updated to match the expected signature of the `_engine` method. This change should resolve the `TypeError` and allow the `round` method to work as expected with a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
