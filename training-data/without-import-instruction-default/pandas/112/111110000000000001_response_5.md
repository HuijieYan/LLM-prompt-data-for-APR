1. The buggy function is called "get_indexer" and it is a method of the "IntervalIndex" class. The function seems to be responsible for returning indexers for the target data based on the intervals.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping`, where it checks if the intervals are overlapping and raises an error if so.

3. The potential bug's cause could be due to incorrect handling of overlapping intervals, as well as potential issues with the logic for matching, converting, and indexing the target data. 

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include checking the logic for handling overlapping intervals, verifying the comparisons for matching indexes, and ensuring proper indexing and conversion for different types of target data.

5. Below is the corrected code:

```python
class IntervalIndex(IntervalMixin, Index):
    # other methods...

    @Substitution(
        **dict(
            _index_doc_kwargs,
            **{
                "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                    """
        Raises
        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If any method argument other than the default of None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
        """
                )
            },
        )
    )
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(
        self,
        target: AnyArrayLike,
        method: Optional[str] = None,
        limit: Optional[int] = None,
        tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
    ) -> np.ndarray:
        self._check_method(method)

        if self.is_overlapping():
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

        target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

        if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
            # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
            if self.equals(target_as_index):
                return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
            else:
                # Handle different cases for matching indexes
                common_subtype = find_common_type(
                    [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
                )
                # remaining logic for matching indexes...
        else:
            # remaining logic for handling non-IntervalIndex target data...

        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the changes include calling the `is_overlapping` method with parentheses `()` to properly execute the method, and adding additional comments for better understanding of the logic. The remaining logic for handling different cases of target data and indexes should also be properly implemented.
