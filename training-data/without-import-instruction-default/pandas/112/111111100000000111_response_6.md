Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the `get_indexer` function in the `IntervalIndex` class, which is part of the pandas library. The function is used to get the indices of the target array in the IntervalIndex. The GitHub issue indicates that the `round()` method fails when the columns are CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` function could be related to the handling of CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. It seems that there might be a type incompatibility issue when using `round()` with such columns.

The cause of this bug could be related to how the `get_indexer` function handles CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. It might not be handling the data types and operations correctly in this specific scenario.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to update the `get_indexer` function to handle CategoricalIndex correctly when it's created from an IntervalIndex. This could involve checking and converting the data types appropriately to ensure compatibility with the `round()` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# ... (other parts of the file remain unchanged)

# this is the fixed function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = []

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, the `get_indexer` function now properly handles the case when the target index is a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. It ensures that the data types are handled correctly for compatibility with the `round()` method. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
