1. The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. This method is attempting to implement logic for finding the index of the target within the interval index. It is performing checks based on the type of the target and the overlap between intervals.

2. The potential error location is in the logic where the method tries to determine the index of the target within the interval index based on the type of the target, whether it is an `IntervalIndex` or a scalar index.

3. The bug may be caused by incorrect logic in determining the index of the target within the interval index, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior. The method seems to be handling different cases based on the type of the target, but the implementation may not be correct.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include revisiting the logic for determining the index of the target within the interval index, ensuring that it correctly handles different types of targets and their relationships with the interval index.

5. Here's the corrected code with fixes:

                [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
            )
            if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
                return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

            # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
            # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
            left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
            right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
        elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
            # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
            target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
            indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
        else:
            # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
            # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
            indexer = []
            for key in target_as_index:
                try:
                    loc = self.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError:
                    loc = -1
                indexer.append(loc)
    
        return ensure_platform_int(np.array(indexer))
```

In the corrected code, the following changes were made:
- `self.is_overlapping` was changed to `self.is_overlapping()` to properly call the method.
- Similarily, `self.left`, `self.right`, and `self._engine` were changed to `self.left()`, `self.right()`, and `self._engine()` to properly call the methods.
- The results of the indexers were converted to arrays using `np.array(indexer)` to ensure proper formatting.
