The potential error in the given function is with the use of undefined variables, such as self._dropout_mask and self._recurrent_dropout_mask. These variables are used without being initialized or defined anywhere in the code. This can lead to errors due to accessing undefined attributes.

To fix this bug, we can initialize these variables either within the class constructor or before using them in the call method. 

Here's the corrected code for the call method:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
        # Initialize dropout matrices for input units and recurrent units
        dp_mask = self._dropout_mask or None
        rec_dp_mask = self._recurrent_dropout_mask or None
        
        h_tm1 = states[0]  # previous memory state
        c_tm1 = states[1]  # previous carry state
        
        # Rest of the function remains the same
        # ...
```
