The error seems to occur when the function `test_implementation_mode` tries to execute `layer_test` with `input_shape=(num_samples, timesteps, embedding_dim)` while passing `use_bias=False` as a keyword argument.

The bug in the `LSTMCell` class's `call` method is likely causing the issue. The bug is likely to be located in the conditional block that executes when `self.implementation == 2`.

The bug occurs because the 'None' value is not supported in certain parts of the code. It seems like there might be a case in the code where the value is not properly defined or initialized, leading to the 'None' value causing an issue.

To fix the bug, ensure that all variables and inputs are properly defined and initialized to prevent 'None' values. Additionally, make sure to handle cases where inputs or variables might be 'None' to gracefully handle such scenarios without causing errors.

Here is the corrected code for the `call` method in the `LSTMCell` class:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # ... (Previous code remains unchanged) ...

    # If training is None, set _uses_learning_phase attribute to True
    if training is None:
        h._uses_learning_phase = True

    return h, [h, c]
```
