The error message suggests that the code is trying to use a variable with the value of None, which is not supported.

The potential error location is likely the "call" method of the function, particularly where the inputs are being used.

The code is likely attempting to use inputs that have a value of None, resulting in the error message.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'inputs' parameter passed to the function is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    if inputs is None:  # check if inputs are None
        raise ValueError("None values not supported for inputs.")
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
