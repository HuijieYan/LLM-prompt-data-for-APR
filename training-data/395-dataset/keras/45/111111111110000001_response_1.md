The error message indicates that there is a problem with creating a TensorProto due to "None values not supported."

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue might be due to the incorrect implementation of the 'call' method in the LSTMCell class. The error message is related to the creation of a TensorProto, which is part of the computations performed in the 'call' method.

The bug is occurring because the 'call' method in the LSTMCell class is not correctly handling the input 'states' and 'inputs' when called from elsewhere in the code. This is leading to a situation where 'None' values are being passed into the computations, resulting in the error when trying to create a TensorProto.

To fix this bug, the 'call' method in the LSTMCell class should be updated to properly handle the 'states' and 'inputs' being passed to it, ensuring that they are not None.

Here is the corrected code for the 'call' method in the LSTMCell class:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    if states is None:
        raise ValueError("states cannot be None.")
    if inputs is None:
        raise ValueError("inputs cannot be None.")

    # rest of the method remains unchanged
    # ... (existing code for 'call' method) ...
```

By adding these checks at the beginning of the 'call' method, we ensure that 'states' and 'inputs' are not None, thus addressing the issue causing the error.
