The error message indicates that there is an issue with handling `None` values, likely within the `call` method of the `LSTMCell` class. This is confirmed by the following part of the error message:
```
TypeError:  if unsupported types are provided.
ValueError: if arguments have inappropriate values or if verify_shape is
True and shape of values is not equals to a shape from the argument.
```

The issue seems to be related to handling `None` values within the TensorFlow backend when processing the inputs.

The bug occurs due to the internal function `make_tensor_proto` not being able to handle `None` values. This is likely causing the `ValueError` when the function is trying to convert the `None` values into a tensor prototype.

To fix this bug, the `None` values need to be handled properly before being passed to the TensorFlow backend function.

The corrected `call` method for the `LSTMCell` class is as follows:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
    if training is not None:
        if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    return h, [h, c]
```
In this corrected code, the issue of handling `None` values is resolved by checking if `training` is not `None` before setting the learning phase.
