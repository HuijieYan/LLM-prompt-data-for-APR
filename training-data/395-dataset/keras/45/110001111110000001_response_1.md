The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `None values not supported`. This means that there is an attempt to use a `None` value where it is not supported.

The potential error location is within the `call` method of the given buggy function. In this method, there are several calculations that depend on the input value `inputs` and `states`. If any of these values is `None`, it could lead to the error mentioned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the input `inputs` or `states` is `None`. It is assuming that these values are always valid. As a result, when the function encounters a `None` value for `inputs`, it throws an error.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check at the beginning of the `call` method to handle the case where `inputs` or `states` is `None`. We can also handle other potential edge cases related to the input and states.

Below is the corrected code for the `call` method of the buggy function:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
        if inputs is None or states is None:
            raise ValueError("None values not supported for inputs or states.")
        
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
