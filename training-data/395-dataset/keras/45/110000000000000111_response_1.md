Potential error location: 

The potential error in the given function is the incorrect handling of the `training` parameter and setting the learning phase. It seems the intent is to set the learning phase for dropout, but it is not being handled correctly.

Reason for the bug:

The bug occurs because the code is trying to set the learning phase for the dropout operation, but it's not being handled appropriately.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

The `training` parameter should be used to determine if the model is in training mode or not. If it is in training mode, the learning phase should be set to `True` for dropout operations, and if it's not in training mode, the learning phase should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `call` function:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # rest of the code remains the same

    h = o * self.activation(c)
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is not None:  # check if training is provided
            h._uses_learning_phase = training  # set the learning phase based on the training parameter
    return h, [h, c]
```
