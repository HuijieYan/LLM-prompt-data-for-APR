Potential error location: The potential error is in the part where the function checks for the value of `training` and sets the `_uses_learning_phase` attribute of `h`.

Reason for the bug: It seems like there is an issue with how the function is handling the `training` argument. The current implementation is trying to set the `_uses_learning_phase` attribute of `h` without properly handling the case where `training` is False or None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix this bug by properly checking the value of `training` and then setting the `_uses_learning_phase` attribute of `h` accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # rest of the code remains the same
    
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is not None:
            h._uses_learning_phase = training
    return h, [h, c]
```
