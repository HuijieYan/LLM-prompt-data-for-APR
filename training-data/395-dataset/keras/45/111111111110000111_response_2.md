The test case is calling the `LSTMCell` class with various arguments such as `units`, `implementation`, `dropout`, `recurrent_dropout`, and `use_bias`. The error message indicates that the `None` values are not supported.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `call` method of the `LSTMCell` class. This method is using `None` values in its operations, which is causing the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling the `None` values properly. It seems that some input or state values are not being properly handled, leading to `None` values being used in operations that do not support them.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the `None` values properly, either by checking for them and providing default values or by skipping operations that cannot handle `None` values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    h_tm1 = states[0]  # previous memory state
    c_tm1 = states[1]  # previous carry state
    
    if h_tm1 is None:
        h_tm1 = tf.zeros_like(inputs)  # Replace None with zeros
    
    if c_tm1 is None:
        c_tm1 = tf.zeros_like(inputs)  # Replace None with zeros
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, before using `h_tm1` and `c_tm1`, we are checking if they are `None` and replacing them with zeros using `tf.zeros_like` to handle the `None` values properly. This will prevent the error related to `None` values.
