Error:
The buggy function is the `call` method of the `LSTMCell` class. The issue seems to be with the calculation of `h = o * self.activation(c)`, as well as the setting of the learning phase for dropout.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The calculation of `h` is not consistent in both branches of the `if self.implementation == 1` condition. In the `else` branch, `h` is calculated using the variable `o`, while in the `if self.implementation == 1` branch, `h` is calculated differently.
2. The setting of the learning phase for dropout is not consistent between the `if self.implementation == 1` and `else` branches.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the calculation of `h` is consistent across both branches of the `if self.implementation == 1` condition.
2. Set the learning phase for dropout in a consistent manner.

Corrected code:
```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # dropout matrices for input units
    dp_mask = self._dropout_mask
    # dropout matrices for recurrent units
    rec_dp_mask = self._recurrent_dropout_mask
    
    h_tm1 = states[0]  # previous memory state
    c_tm1 = states[1]  # previous carry state
    
    if self.implementation == 1:
        # ... (previous code) ...
        
        h = self.activation(c) * self.recurrent_activation(o)
    else:
        # ... (previous code) ...
        
        h = self.activation(c) * self.recurrent_activation(o)
    
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is None:
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    return h, [h, c]
