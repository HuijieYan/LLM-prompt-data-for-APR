The error message indicates that the issue occurs in the `text_to_word_sequence` function in the file `text.py`. The error is due to the `maketrans` function, which requires two arguments of equal length.

The bug occurs because when the `split` parameter is longer than one character, the `maketrans` function receives two arguments of unequal lengths, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `maketrans` function to ensure that both arguments have equal lengths, regardless of the length of the `split` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), ord(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
         translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this corrected code, we use `str.maketrans` to ensure that the length of both arguments is the same, regardless of the length of the `split` parameter. This will fix the `ValueError` that was occurring when using multi-character split strings.
