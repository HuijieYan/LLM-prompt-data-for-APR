The error occurs because the `maketrans` function expects the same length arguments for the first two parameters. In the provided function, the `maketrans` function is being called with `filters` and `split` where `filters` is a string containing multiple characters while `split` is a single character. This causes the error as the length of the two strings is not the same.

To fix the bug, the `maketrans` function needs to be called with the same length arguments. Additionally, the import statement for `sys` is missing at the beginning of the function, which also needs to be added.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

In the corrected function, the `maketrans` function is replaced with `str.maketrans` to ensure it works with Python 3, and the extra `unicode` type checks have been removed. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work as intended.
