The bug appears to be in the logic for creating the translate_map variable. This map is used to replace characters in the text with the split string.

The bug occurs because the length of the split string is not equal to the length of the filters string. This causes the maketrans function to raise an error stating that the first two arguments must have equal length.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to ensure that the split string is repeated to match the length of the filters string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import sys
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))  # Repeat split string to match filter length

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this correction, the translate_map will have lengths matching and the code should work as expected without raising the ValueError.
