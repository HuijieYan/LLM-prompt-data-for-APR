The error is occurring due to the usage of the `maketrans` function with unequal length arguments. This function is used to create a translation table that maps the characters in the `filters` string to the character in the `split` string at the same position. When the `split` string has more than one character, the length of both arguments becomes unequal, causing the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to build a translation table manually instead of using the `maketrans` function. We can iterate over each character in the `filters` string and replace it with the `split` string. Then, we can use the `translate` method to perform the translation.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this corrected implementation, the ValueError raised due to the unequal length arguments passed to the `maketrans` function should be resolved.
