The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line:
`translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`

The bug occurs because the `maketrans` function expects the two arguments to have equal length. In the buggy function, `filters` and `split * len(filters)` are not of equal length, causing the `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the line using the `translate` method of string objects, which takes a translation table as an argument. This translation table can be created using the `str.maketrans()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this correction, the function should work as intended without raising the `ValueError`.
