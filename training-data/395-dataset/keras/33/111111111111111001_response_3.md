The bug is present in the `text_to_word_sequence` function in the `keras/preprocessing/text.py` file. The error occurs due to the use of the `maketrans` function, specifically at this line: `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`.

The maketrans function is used to create a translation table that maps one character to another. The error occurs because the length of the `filters` and `split * len(filters)` parameters should be equal. However, in the provided code, the length of these parameters is not checked for equality before passing them to the `maketrans` function. This results in a ValueError due to the mismatch in lengths.

To fix this bug, the length of `filters` and `split * len(filters)` should be checked before passing them to the `maketrans` function. One approach to fix this issue is to create the translation table manually using a dictionary and the `str.maketrans` method. 

Below is the corrected `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)

    return [i for i in text.split(split) if i]
```

Now, the `translate_dict` dictionary is used to create the translation table, and the `translate` method is applied directly to `text` using this dictionary. This approach ensures that the translation table is created correctly, resolving the ValueError that occurred in the previous implementation.
