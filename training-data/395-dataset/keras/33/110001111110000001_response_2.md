The error is likely in the `text_to_word_sequence` function when using `maketrans` to create the translation map for filtering characters. The ValueError is because the filters and split arguments passed to `maketrans` do not have equal length.

The bug occurs because the code mistakenly assumes that the length of the `filters` and `split` parameters will be the same or that there are equal characters to split. This assumption is not necessarily valid, especially when using multicharacter splits as demonstrated in the test case.

To fix the bug, a custom translation map should be created by iterating through the filter characters and assigning the corresponding split characters. This way, the length of filters and split doesn't need to be the same, and the translation will work for multi-character splits as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this correction, the `text_to_word_sequence` function should now handle multi-character splits and create the correct translation map, resolving the ValueError.
