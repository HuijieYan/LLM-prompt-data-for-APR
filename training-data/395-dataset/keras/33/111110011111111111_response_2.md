The error is occurring in the `translate_map` assignment part of the function. The `maketrans` function requires both input strings to have the same length, but in the provided code, the length of `filters` and `split * len(filters)` might not be equal.

The reason for the bug is that the `maketrans` function expects the same length arguments for translation. Using `split * len(filters)` does not guarantee the same length as `filters`.

To fix the bug, you can use the `str.maketrans()` method, which allows for one-to-one character translation. This will handle the translation of characters in `filters` to characters in `split`.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
``` 

The `str.maketrans()` method creates a translation table that maps characters in `filters` to characters in `split` and is used by the `translate` method to perform the translation. This should resolve the error and allow the function to work as expected.
