The potential error in the function is in the line where the translate_map is being defined. The bug occurs due to incompatible usage of unicode and str types. This function is meant to split the input text into a sequence of words or tokens based on the provided split markers, while also converting to lowercase and filtering out specific characters. The bug arises from the usage of unicode and str types which are not compatible in the if condition. 

To fix the bug:
- Use `str.maketrans()` to generate the translation map for filtering out characters. 
- Use `str.translate()` to apply the translation map to the input text.
- Use `text.split()` to split the filtered text based on the provided split marker.

Here is the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
