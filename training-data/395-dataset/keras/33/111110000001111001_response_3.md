Error location:
The potential error is occurring in the statement where the translation map is created for filtering out characters.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. For Python 2, the code is not handling the translation of characters properly.
2. In Python 3, the `maketrans` function is being used incorrectly, and it needs to be imported from the `string` module.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `unicde` and `maketrans` functions from the `string` module.
2. Use the `maketrans` function to create the translation map for filtering out characters.

Corrected code:

```python
import sys
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
