The bug is occurring in the `text_to_word_sequence` function. The issue is with the `maketrans` function, which is used to create a translation table for translating characters in a string. The error message indicates that the first two `maketrans` arguments must have equal length.

The reason for this bug is that the `split` parameter is expected to be a single character, but in the test cases provided, it is a multi-character string ("stop").

To fix the bug, the `maketrans` method should be used with two strings of equal length. One string will contain the characters to be replaced, and the other will contain the characters to replace them with.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    else:
        translate_dict = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected code uses the `ord` function to create a translation dictionary for Unicode characters if the string is an instance of `str`. Otherwise, it uses the `str.maketrans` method to create a translation table for the given filters and split markers.

With this corrected code, the `text_to_word_sequence` function should be able to handle multi-character split markers without raising a ValueError.
