The error message indicates a "ValueError" occurring at line 44 of the "text_to_word_sequence" function within the "keras/preprocessing/text.py" file. The specific error message is "the first two maketrans arguments must have equal length". 

The issue stems from the "maketrans" function call within the "text_to_word_sequence" function. The "maketrans" function requires two arguments of equal length, but in this case, the length of the "filters" and "split * len(filters)" are not matching, leading to the ValueError.

The potential approach for fixing the bug would be to use a loop to create a translation map and replace the "maketrans" function. Another approach would be to create a dictionary mapping individual characters from the "filters" string to the "split" string. This will ensure that the translation map is correctly created and can be applied to the input text.

Here's the corrected code for the "text_to_word_sequence" function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {}
    for c in filters:
        translate_dict[ord(c)] = split

    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected code avoids using the "maketrans" function and directly creates a dictionary for translation, ensuring that the translation map is correctly created and applied to the input text.
