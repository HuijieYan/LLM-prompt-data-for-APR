## Error location and reason
The potential error is in the `translate_map` assignment and the subsequent `maketrans` function. The error occurs because `maketrans` is not defined within the function and does not work as intended.

## Correction method
To fix the bug, we can use the `str.maketrans` method to create the translation map for filtering out characters.

## Corrected code
```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
