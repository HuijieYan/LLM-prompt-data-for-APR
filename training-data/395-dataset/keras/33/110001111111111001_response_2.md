Potential Error Location: The error is occurring in the `maketrans` function when creating the translation map.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug: The bug is happening because the `maketrans` function requires both arguments to have the same length, but in the `text_to_word_sequence` method, the length of `filters` and `split * len(filters)` is different, leading to a ValueError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to ensure that the lengths of `filters` and `split * len(filters)` are the same when using the `maketrans` function.

Corrected Code:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

The corrected code removes the use of `maketrans` and directly creates a dictionary `translate_map` to map the characters in `filters` to the `split` character. This ensures that the lengths of the two arguments are the same, addressing the ValueError.
