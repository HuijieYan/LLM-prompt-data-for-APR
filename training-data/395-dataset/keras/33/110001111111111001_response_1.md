The error occurs in the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))` within the `text_to_word_sequence` function. This means that the `maketrans` function is receiving two arguments of unequal length, which leads to a `ValueError`.

The reason for this bug is that the `maketrans` function requires two strings of equal length as arguments. However, in the buggy code, the `split` argument is being multiplied by the length of the `filters` string, causing them to be of unequal length.

To fix this bug, you can simply replace `split * len(filters)` with `split * len(split)`. This will ensure that the `split` string has the same length as the `filters` string, satisfying the requirements of the `maketrans` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(split))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
