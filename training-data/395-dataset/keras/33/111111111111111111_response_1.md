The test cases provided have a specific split marker ('stop') that is supposed to split the input text into words based on the occurrence of the split marker. However, the buggy function `text_to_word_sequence` uses the `maketrans` function to create a translation map, and the error occurs in this step due to the unequal length of the first two arguments passed to `maketrans`.

The potential error location is the line:
```python
translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
```

The reason behind the bug is that the `maketrans` function expects two strings of equal length as arguments, but in this case, `filters` and `split * len(filters)` have different lengths. This causes a ValueError to be raised, as observed in the error messages.

To fix this issue, the `translate_map` should be constructed in a different way, ensuring that the lengths of the two input strings are equal before passing them to `maketrans`.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

In the corrected code, the `translate_dict` is used to create the translation map by mapping characters from `filters` to the `split` character. This ensures that the translation map is of equal length, resolving the ValueError that was occurring before.
