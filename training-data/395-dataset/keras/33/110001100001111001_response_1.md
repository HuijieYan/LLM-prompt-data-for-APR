The code has a bug that causes it to split the text into empty strings when using the `filters` and `split` parameters. This bug occurs because of the use of the `maketrans` function, which is not compatible with the code. The translate_map is also incorrectly assigned with unicode characters.

To fix the bug, we can use the `str.translate` function with a translation table. This allows us to map characters to None, which effectively removes them from the string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = dict((c, split) for c in filters)
    text = text.translate(str.maketrans(translate_dict))
    seq = [i for i in text.split(split) if i]
    return seq
```
This code uses the `str.maketrans` function to create a translation table and the `translate` function to apply the translation to the input text. It then splits the text and removes any empty strings from the result.
