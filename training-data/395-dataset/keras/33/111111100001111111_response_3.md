The issue with the code is that when the split string has more than one character, the length of the filters and split characters is not equal. This causes the `maketrans` function to throw an error because it expects equal-length arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `translate_map` generation logic by using translation mappings based on individual characters, rather than using a single split character for all filter characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

By using individual characters for translation mapping, we ensure that the `maketrans` function will receive equal-length arguments, thereby avoiding the ValueError mentioned in the GitHub issue.
