The bug occurs because the `maketrans` function in Python requires the input strings to be of equal length, but in the provided code, the split string and filters have different lengths. This discrepancy causes the `maketrans` function to throw an error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the split string and filters have the same length when creating the translation map.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys
if sys.version_info < (3,):
    from string import maketrans
else:
    maketrans = str.maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle cases where the split string has more than one character, and the bug causing the `ValueError` will be resolved.
