The error is occurring because the `maketrans()` function is being used with two arguments that do not have equal lengths. This function is used for creating a translation table that maps one set of characters to another.

The issue is that in the else block of the code, `maketrans()` is being called with `filters` and `split * len(filters)` as arguments. The lengths of these two arguments are not equal, which is causing the `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, you can use the `str.maketrans()` method to create a translation map and then use `str.translate()` to apply the map to the text.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]

```

The `str.maketrans()` method has been replaced with a dictionary comprehension to create `translate_dict`, which is then used with `str.translate()` to apply the translation to the text.
