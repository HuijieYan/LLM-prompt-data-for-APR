The error occurs in the `text_to_word_sequence` function when the `split` parameter is set to a string with more than one character. This causes an error because the `maketrans` function requires the first two arguments to have equal length.

The bug occurs because the `maketrans` function is being used with arguments of different lengths, which causes the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `str.maketrans` function and `str.translate` method to create a translation table with characters from `filters` replaced with the `split` character. We also need to import the `sys` module at the start of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True,
                          split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
