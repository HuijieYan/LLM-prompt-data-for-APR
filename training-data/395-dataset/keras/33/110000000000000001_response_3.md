Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line "if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):"

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to check the version of Python being used, but it is missing the import statement for the sys module.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to import the sys module and use sys.version_info to check the Python version, and then implement the necessary code based on the version.

Corrected code:
```python
import sys
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info[0] < 3 and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
