The error is occurring in the `text_to_word_sequence` function due to the use of the `maketrans` method with arguments of unequal length. This is causing a ValueError because `maketrans` requires two arguments of equal length.

The issue is that the `maketrans` method is being called with `filters` and `split * len(filters)`, where `split` and `len(filters)` are not necessarily equal in length. This is causing the `ValueError` to be raised.

The bug can be fixed by using a more appropriate method or approach to replace characters in the `text` string with the `split` character. It's recommended to use a loop to replace each character in `filters` with the `split` character.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]

```

This corrected code uses a dictionary comprehension to create the `translate_dict` that maps each character in `filters` to the `split` character. Then, the `text` is translated using this dictionary, and the split is performed to get the list of words. This approach ensures that the `maketrans` issue is resolved.
