1. The test case is using the `text_to_word_sequence` function with a multichar split parameter, causing the function to fail with a ValueError due to unequal lengths of the maketrans arguments.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `maketrans` function requires both arguments to have equal length, but in this case, `filters` and `split * len(filters)` are of unequal lengths.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use a different method to split the text into words using a multichar split. We can use the `replace` function to replace the split marker with a common delimiter and then split the text using that delimiter.

5. Corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    text = text.replace(split, ' ')
    seq = text.split()
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this updated code, the test cases should pass without any errors.
