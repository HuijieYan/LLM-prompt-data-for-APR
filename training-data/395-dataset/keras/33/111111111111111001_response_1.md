The error is likely occurring due to the `maketrans()` function being used incorrectly in the `text_to_word_sequence` method. The error message indicates that "the first two maketrans arguments must have equal length."

The likely reason for this bug is that the `maketrans()` function is being called with arguments `filters` and `split * len(filters)`, and these two arguments do not have equal length.

To fix this bug, we can use the `str.translate()` method directly instead of using `maketrans()` and `translate()`. This can be done by creating a translation table using `str.maketrans()` to replace characters in the `filters` string with the `split` string, and then applying this translation table using the `translate()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` method:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

By using the `translate()` method with a translation table created using `str.maketrans()`, we avoid the erroneous use of `maketrans()` and resolve the bug.
