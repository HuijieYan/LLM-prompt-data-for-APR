The test case `test_text_to_word_sequence_multichar_split` provides a string "hello!stop?world!" and expects the function `text_to_word_sequence` to split the string by the word "stop" and return `['hello', 'world']`. However, the function throws a ValueError because the `maketrans` function is not able to handle cases where the `filters` and `split` strings have different lengths.

The potential error location is the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))` inside the `text_to_word_sequence` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `maketrans` function expects two strings of equal length, where each character in the first string will be replaced with the corresponding character in the second string.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to create a translation mapping that handles multi-character splits. This can be achieved by using the `str.split` and `str.join` functions.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    for char in filters:
        text = text.replace(char, split)

    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected function uses the `replace` method to replace each character in the `filters` string with the `split` string. Then, it splits the text using the `split` string and returns a list of words.
