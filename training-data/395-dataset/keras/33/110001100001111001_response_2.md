The issue with the code is that the translation map is not being created correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior when trying to split the text.

The bug occurs because the translation map is not being created properly due to the misuse of the `maketrans` function. This causes incorrect splitting of the text, leading to unexpected results.

To fix this bug, we can use a different approach to create the translation map. We can use the `str.translate` function directly to create the translation map and then apply it to the text.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if isinstance(text, str):
        translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
        text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    else:  # Python 2 (untested)
        assert isinstance(text, unicode), '`text` should be unicode in Python 2'
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
        text = text.translate(translate_map)

    seq = [i for i in text.split(split) if i]
    return seq
```

This corrected code creates a translation dictionary `translate_dict` using a dictionary comprehension, which is then used to translate the text. The logic for Python 2 is also included, although it's untested.
