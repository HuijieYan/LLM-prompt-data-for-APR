The error is occurring because when the `filters` string has more characters than the `split` string, the `maketrans` function in the `text_to_word_sequence` method is trying to create a translation table with unequal length arguments, which is causing the ValueError.

To fix this issue, we can create a translation map using the `str.maketrans` method which takes two strings of equal length. Then we can use the `translate` method to replace the characters based on the translation map.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
if sys.version_info < (3,):
    maketrans = ''.join([chr(i) for i in range(256)]).maketrans
else:
    maketrans = str.maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this corrected code, the `maketrans` method is used to create a translation map with equal-length arguments, and then the `translate` method is used to replace the characters in the text based on the translation map. This should resolve the issue of the ValueError occurring when the input `filters` and `split` strings have different lengths.
