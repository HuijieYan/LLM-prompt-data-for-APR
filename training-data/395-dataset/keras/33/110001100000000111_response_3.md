Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters)) line in the text_to_word_sequence function.

Reasons behind the Bug: 
The error message "ValueError: the first two maketrans arguments must have equal length" is indicating that the length of the two arguments passed to maketrans must be the same, but in the current implementation, the split * len(filters) is causing the second argument to be longer than the first argument filters.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to ensure that the two arguments passed to maketrans are of equal length.
2. We can use a loop to create a mapping of each character in filters to the split character instead of multiplying the split character by the length of filters.

Corrected Code:
```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))  # Use str.maketrans for Python 3.x

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
