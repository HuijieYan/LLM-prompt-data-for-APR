The error message indicates that a ValueError occurred at line 44 of the 'text_to_word_sequence' function. The error is caused by the 'maketrans' function, specifically its arguments not having equal length.

The reason for this bug is that the 'maketrans' function expects the two strings passed to it to have the same length, but in this case, the 'filters' string and the 'split' string do not have the same length.

To fix this bug, the 'maketrans' function should be updated to use the translation table for removing characters specified in the 'filters' string.

Here's the corrected code for the 'text_to_word_sequence' function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_33/keras/preprocessing/text.py

import sys
import re

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    filters = filters.replace('\n', ' ')
    translate_dict = dict((c, split) for c in filters)
    translate_map = str.maketrans(translate_dict)
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = re.split(split, text)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected code uses the 'str.maketrans' function to create the translation table from the 'filters' string, ensuring that the translation table has equal lengths for the arguments. Additionally, it uses the 're.split' function to split the text based on the provided 'split' string.
