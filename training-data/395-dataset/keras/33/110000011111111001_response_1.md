The bug in the provided function text_to_word_sequence arises from the `maketrans` function, which requires two strings of equal length as arguments. In the buggy function, the `split` string is being replicated to match the length of the `filters` string, resulting in the ValueError due to unequal lengths.

To fix this bug, the `maketrans` function should be used with the same `filters` and `split` strings, ensuring that they have equal lengths.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), ord(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

In the corrected code, the `maketrans` function is used with `filters` and `split` to create the `translate_map` for character translation.

With this correction, the function should be able to handle the multicharacter split case that resulted in the ValueError previously.
