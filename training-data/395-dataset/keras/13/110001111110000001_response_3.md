The test case `test_model_methods` is testing various methods of the `Model` class in Keras. The error occurs when the `fit_generator` method is called with `workers=0`.

The problem is within the `fit_generator` method of the `training_generator.py` file. When `workers=0`, the method tries to raise a `ValueError` because `steps` is not specified and the generator is not a Keras `Sequence` class.

The reason for this behavior is that when `workers=0`, the method assumes that the generator is not based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class and hence requires the `steps` argument to be specified explicitly.

To fix this issue, the logic of the `fit_generator` method should be modified to handle the case when `workers=0` and the generator is not a sequence.

The corrected code for the `fit_generator` method is as follows:

```python
def fit_generator(model, generator, steps_per_epoch=None, epochs=1, verbose=1, callbacks=None, validation_data=None, validation_steps=None, class_weight=None, max_queue_size=10, workers=1, use_multiprocessing=False, shuffle=True, initial_epoch=0):
    # existing code

    if workers == 0 and steps_per_epoch is None:
        # The number of steps is not specified, it should be derived from the generator.
        if isinstance(generator, Sequence):
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')
    
    # existing code
```

This modified code will handle the case when `workers=0` and the `steps` are not specified for non-sequence generators by calculating the steps based on the length of the generator.
