The error observed here is in the `fit_generator` function. The error is likely to occur due to the fact that the variable `steps_per_epoch` is not being calculated accurately and is set to a hard-coded value, which is expected to be derived from the `generator` input.

The `fit_generator` function is designed to handle the training of Keras models using a Python generator. It allows the model to be trained on data that is too large to fit into memory by allowing real-time data augmentation and processing.

To fix this issue, the steps_per_epoch should be calculated based on the length of the generator when it is not an instance of `Sequence`. Additionally, the variable `validation_steps` should be calculated based on the length of the `validation_data` when it is not an instance of `Sequence`.

Here's the corrected `fit_generator` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    wait_time = 0.01  # in seconds
    epoch = initial_epoch

    # ... (omitted code)

    if steps_per_epoch is None:  # Calculate steps_per_epoch based on generator length
        if not isinstance(generator, Sequence):
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a'
                             ' generator based on the '
                             '`keras.utils.Sequence`'
                             ' class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` '
                             'or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')
    
    # ... (rest of the code)

    # Calculate validation_steps based on validation_data length
    if do_validation:
        if val_gen and not isinstance(validation_data, Sequence) and not validation_steps:
            validation_steps = len(validation_data)
        elif validation_steps is None and (is_sequence and not validation_steps):
            raise ValueError('`validation_steps=None` is only valid for a'
                             ' generator based on the '
                             '`keras.utils.Sequence`'
                             ' class. Please specify `validation_steps` or use'
                             ' the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')
    
    # ... (continue with the rest of the function)
```

In this corrected implementation, the `steps_per_epoch` and `validation_steps` are calculated based on the length of the generator and validation data, respectively, to ensure they are appropriate for the specific inputs being used for training and validation.
