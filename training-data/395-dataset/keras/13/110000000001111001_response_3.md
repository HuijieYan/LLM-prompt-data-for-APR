The error is likely occurring because the `fit_generator` function contains multiple `return` statements, but not all paths of the function have a `return` statement. This means that in some cases, the function may not return anything. 

To fix this issue, you can ensure that the function returns a value in all cases. You can add a final `return` statement at the end of the function body, outside of any conditional statements. 

Here's the corrected `fit_generator` function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    # Function body goes here
    
    return model.history  # Adding a return statement at the end
```
With this change, the function is guaranteed to return a value, preventing any unexpected behavior due to missing return statements.
