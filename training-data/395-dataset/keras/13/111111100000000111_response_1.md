The bug seems to be occurring in the `fit_generator` function, specifically around the handling of the `validation_data` when using `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence` for both training and validation. The error message indicates that the `steps=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case when using `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence` for validation data.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified in the `fit_generator` function to properly handle the `validation_data` when it is an instance of `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence`.

Here's the corrected code for the `fit_generator` function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if validation_data is not None and isinstance(validation_data, Sequence):
        validation_steps = len(validation_data)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

By checking if the `validation_data` is not None and is an instance of `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence`, we can set the `validation_steps` to the length of the validation data, which aligns with the behavior expected when using a sequence-based generator. This should resolve the issue and prevent the ValueError related to `steps=None` in the `evaluate_generator` function.
