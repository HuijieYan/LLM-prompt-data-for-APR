The error occurs when the `fit_generator` function is called in the test case. The error message indicates that the `fit_generator` function requires the `steps` parameter when a non-Sequence generator is used. 

The potential error location within the `fit_generator` function is in the segment where it checks for the validity of the `steps` parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `steps` parameter is required to correctly process a non-Sequence generator, and if it is not provided, a ValueError is raised.

To fix the bug, the `fit_generator` function needs to be modified to handle cases where the `steps` parameter is not specified for a non-Sequence generator.

Here's the corrected code for the `fit_generator` function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    wait_time = 0.01  # in seconds
    epoch = initial_epoch

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    is_sequence = isinstance(generator, Sequence)
    if not is_sequence and use_multiprocessing and workers > 1:
        warnings.warn(UserWarning('Using a generator with `use_multiprocessing=True`'
                                  ' and multiple workers may duplicate your data.'
                                  ' Please consider using the`keras.utils.Sequence'
                                  ' class.'))

    if steps_per_epoch is None and not is_sequence:
        steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, when `steps_per_epoch` is not provided, and the generator is not a Sequence, the number of steps is set to the length of the generator to handle a non-Sequence generator properly.
