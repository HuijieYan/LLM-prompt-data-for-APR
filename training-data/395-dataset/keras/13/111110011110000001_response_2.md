The error is occurring in the `fit_generator` method, where it is failing with the ValueError: '`steps=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class. Please specify `steps` or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.'

The issue arises because the `fit_generator` method does not handle cases where 'steps' is not specified and the generator is not based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

To fix the issue, we can modify the code within the `fit_generator` method to handle the case where 'steps' is not specified, and it's not a `keras.utils.Sequence` class. We can set 'steps' to the length of the generator in this case.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    wait_time = 0.01  # in seconds
    epoch = initial_epoch
    # rest of the code goes here

    is_sequence = isinstance(generator, Sequence)
    if not is_sequence and use_multiprocessing and workers > 1:
        warnings.warn(
            UserWarning('Using a generator with `use_multiprocessing=True`'
                        ' and multiple workers may duplicate your data.'
                        ' Please consider using the`keras.utils.Sequence'
                        ' class.'))
    if steps_per_epoch is None:
        if is_sequence:
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a'
                             ' generator based on the '
                             '`keras.utils.Sequence`'
                             ' class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` '
                             'or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')
    if steps_per_epoch is None and not is_sequence:
        steps_per_epoch = len(generator)  # set steps_per_epoch as the length of the generator

    # rest of the code goes here

    return model.history
```

In the corrected code, we have added an additional condition to handle the case when 'steps_per_epoch' is None and the generator is not based on `keras.utils.Sequence`. This change should allow the method to run without raising a ValueError.
