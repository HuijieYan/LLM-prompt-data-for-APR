The error occurs when the model is being trained using fit_generator with workers=0, which indicates that no multiprocessing is used. Additionally, the training and validation data provided are custom sequences that inherit from keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence. When the model is evaluated during training using evaluate_generator, the check for whether the data is a Sequence is failing, leading to the ValueError.

The problem is likely due to the logic used to identify if the data is a Sequence. It seems that the check is not correctly recognizing the custom Sequence instances, leading to the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the logic for identifying if the data is a Sequence should be revised to ensure that custom Sequence instances are correctly recognized.

Here's the corrected code for the fit_generator method:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""

    # ... (previous code)

    if hasattr(validation_data, 'data') and isinstance(validation_data.data, Sequence) and not validation_steps:
        validation_steps = len(validation_data)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return model.history
```

In the corrected code, after validating that the validation_data has a 'data' attribute and that this attribute is an instance of Sequence, we set the validation_steps to the length of the data. This way, the validation steps are correctly calculated based on the custom Sequence.

This fix should resolve the issue with evaluate_generator not recognizing the validation data as a Sequence and allow the model to be trained using fit_generator successfully.
