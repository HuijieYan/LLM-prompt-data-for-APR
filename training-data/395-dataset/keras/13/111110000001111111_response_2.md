The error occurs because the function `fit_generator` is trying to use the `steps` parameter when `validation_steps` is None, but it should only do so for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to handle the case when `validation_steps` is None and the validation data is a subclass of `keras.utils.Sequence`. If this is the case, we should set `validation_steps` to the length of the validation data.

Here's the corrected code for the `fit_generator` function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    # ... (previous code)

    if isinstance(validation_data, Sequence) and not validation_steps:
        validation_steps = len(validation_data)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By adding this condition, we ensure that `validation_steps` is properly handled when using a subclass of `keras.utils.Sequence` for validation data. This should prevent the ValueError related to `steps=None` from being raised.

It's important to thoroughly test this change with a variety of cases to ensure that the fix works as intended and does not introduce any new issues.
