The potential error location within the problematic function is the code block where it checks for the type of `validation_data` and tries to use `Sequence`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to use `Sequence` without properly handling the case when `validation_data` is an instance of `Sequence`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Checking if `validation_data` is an instance of `Sequence` and handling it accordingly.
2. Setting `validation_steps` if `validation_data` is an instance of `Sequence`.
3. Making sure that the code properly handles the case when `validation_data` is an instance of `Sequence` by iterating through it or using its length as `validation_steps`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    val_gen = False
    if validation_data:
        if isinstance(validation_data, Sequence):
            val_gen = True
            validation_steps = validation_steps or len(validation_data)

    # ... (remaining code) ...
```

In this corrected code, we are explicitly checking if `validation_data` is an instance of `Sequence` and setting `validation_steps` accordingly. This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
