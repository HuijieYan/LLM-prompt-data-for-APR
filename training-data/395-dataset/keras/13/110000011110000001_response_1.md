The error occurs when calling the `fit_generator` function from the `test_model_methods` function. The error message indicates that the value of `steps` is required, and it should not be None. This is associated with the `fit_generator` function's implementation, specifically within the block where it checks if `steps` is None.

The bug occurs because the `fit_generator` function does not handle the case where `steps` is None, especially when the generator is not based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

To fix this bug, the `fit_generator` function should be modified to handle the case where `steps` is None. This can be achieved by providing a default number of steps based on the length of the generator when it's not an instance of `Sequence`.

Here is the corrected `fit_generator` function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    wait_time = 0.01  # in seconds
    epoch = initial_epoch

    do_validation = bool(validation_data)
    model._make_train_function()
    if do_validation:
        model._make_test_function()

    is_sequence = isinstance(generator, Sequence)
    if not is_sequence and use_multiprocessing and workers > 1:
        warnings.warn(
            UserWarning('Using a generator with `use_multiprocessing=True`'
                        ' and multiple workers may duplicate your data.'
                        ' Please consider using the`keras.utils.Sequence`'
                        ' class.'))
    if steps_per_epoch is None:
        if is_sequence:
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)  # Set steps_per_epoch to the length of the generator

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
In this corrected version, `steps_per_epoch` is set to the length of the generator when it's not an instance of `Sequence`, ensuring that it's not None.
