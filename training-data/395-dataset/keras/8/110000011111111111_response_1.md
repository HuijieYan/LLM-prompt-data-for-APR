The error occurs in the `process_node` function, specifically in the construction of the `Concatenate` layer. The bug happens because the order of the layers in the model config file is followed when recreating the model. During deserialization, Keras attempts to create the first output of `dense_2` layer, but it cannot because the input layers `reshape_1` aren't available. Then it tries to create the second output using `input_2`, which works because these layers are available. When the first node is re-queued and created in the next attempt, it swaps the output order of the output nodes of the `dense_2` layer. This leads to an incorrect shape mismatch at the `Concatenate` layer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the nodes are processed in the correct order and that the input shapes match when creating the `Concatenate` layer. We can accomplish this by tracking the layer depths and processing the nodes in order of layer depth to ensure that the input shapes align properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other parts of the method)

    # Function to get the depth of a layer in the model
    def get_layer_depth(layer):
        if layer in layer_depths:
            return layer_depths[layer]
        inbound_nodes = layer._inbound_nodes
        if not inbound_nodes:
            depth = 0
        else:
            depth = max([get_layer_depth(node.inbound_layers[0]) for node in inbound_nodes]) + 1
        layer_depths[layer] = depth
        return depth

    layer_depths = {}
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Sort the unprocessed_nodes based on the layer depth
    unprocessed_nodes = {k: v for k, v in sorted(unprocessed_nodes.items(), key=lambda item: get_layer_depth(item[0]))}

    # Process nodes in order of layer depth
    for layer, nodes in unprocessed_nodes.items():
        for node_data in nodes:
            process_node(layer, node_data)

    # ... (other parts of the method)
```

By enforcing the correct layer depth prioritization and processing the nodes accordingly, the bug should be fixed, and the `Concatenate` layer should be created with the correct input shapes.
