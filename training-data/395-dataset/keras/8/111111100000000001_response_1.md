The potential error location in the `from_config` method is the handling of unprocessed nodes. The code is trying to process the unprocessed nodes before creating all the layers, which can lead to errors when trying to access the nodes that don't exist yet. This could be the reason for the bug.

The approach for fixing the bug would be to first create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed, then process the nodes in order of layer depth, re-enqueuing nodes that cannot yet be processed until all nodes are processed.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    created_layers = {}
    unprocessed_nodes = []

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    def add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data):
        unprocessed_nodes.append((layer, node_data))

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed are re-enqueued, and the
    # process is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        layer, node_data = unprocessed_nodes.pop(0)
        process_node(layer, node_data)

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

This corrected code processes all nodes after creating all layers and enqueuing nodes to be processed, ensuring that all nodes are processed in the correct order.
