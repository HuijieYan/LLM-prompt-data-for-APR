The test case `test_layer_sharing_at_heterogeneous_depth_order` creates a model and then attempts to reconstruct the model using the function `Model.from_config(config)`. This test case is intended to check for a bug related to layer sharing at heterogeneous depth when the layers need to be applied in an order that differs from the order that occurs in the config.

The error occurs when the model is reconstructed using the `Model.from_config(config)` function. Specifically, the error message indicates a problem related to the shape and inputs of the `Concatenate` layer, suggesting that there is an issue with the shapes of the input tensors when reconstructing the model.

Based on the provided function, the potential error location is within the `process_node` function, where layer calls are made based on input tensors.

The error occurs because the logic for processing the layers and nodes in the `from_config` function is not handling the input shapes properly, leading to a mismatch in input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer.

To fix the bug, the `process_node` function should be modified to ensure that the input shapes are properly processed before making layer calls. Additionally, the input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer should be validated to ensure that they match before creating the layer.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` function with the `process_node` function fixed:

```python
# ... (other code)

def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other code)

    def process_node(layer, node_data):
        input_tensors = []
        input_shapes = []
        for input_data in node_data:
            inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
            inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
            inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
            if len(input_data) == 3:
                kwargs = {}
            elif len(input_data) == 4:
                kwargs = input_data[3]
            else:
                raise ValueError('Improperly formatted model config.')
            inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
            inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
            inbound_tensor = inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index]
            input_tensors.append(inbound_tensor)
            input_shapes.append(inbound_tensor.shape)
            
        # Check if input_shapes are compatible
        if len(set(input_shapes)) > 1:
            raise ValueError('Input shapes are not compatible for node: {}'.format(node_data))
        
        # Call layer on its inputs, thus creating the node
        # and building the layer if needed.
        if input_tensors:
            layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

    # ... (other code)

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the `process_node` function now processes input shapes and checks for compatibility before making layer calls. Additionally, it raises an error if the input shapes are not compatible, ensuring that the shape mismatch issue is addressed.
