The test case provided aims to load a model from its config using the `Model.from_config` method. It involves creating a model with shared layers at multiple depths and applying those layers in an order that differs from the order in the config.

The error message occurs within the `from_config` method of the `Network` class. Specifically, it fails when attempting to concatenate output tensors with mismatched shapes.

The bug occurs because the method does not handle the order in which shared layers are applied correctly. When attempting to deserialize the layers using the inputs, the method may create the first output using different input layers before creating the second output, leading to a mismatch in output shapes. This is due to the re-queuing of nodes and creating them at different times, which may change the output order.

To fix the bug, the `from_config` method needs to ensure that the order in which shared layers are applied is consistent with the order in the config when deserializing the layers.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    # create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # process nodes in order of layer depth
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    if layer in created_layers:  # Check if layer is already created
                        process_node(layer, node_data)

    # rearrange the input tensors based on the provided data
    input_tensors = [created_layers[layer_data['name']]._inbound_nodes[0].output_tensors[0]
                     for layer_data in config['input_layers']]
    output_tensors = [created_layers[layer_data['name']]._inbound_nodes[0].output_tensors[0]
                      for layer_data in config['output_layers']]

    name = config.get('name')
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

In the corrected method, the order of layer creation and node processing is handled sequentially to ensure that the shared layers are applied in a consistent order, preventing the issue of mismatched output shapes. This corrected approach should address the bug.
