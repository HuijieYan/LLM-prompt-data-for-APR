The bug seems to be related to the incorrect deserialization of the layers when loading a model from a config file. The error occurs when the inputs to a shared layer are not in the correct order in the model config file.

The error message indicates that a `Concatenate` layer requires inputs with matching shapes except for the concat axis, and the inputs provided do not have matching shapes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `process_node` function, where the input order and shape are not properly handled when creating the nodes for the shared layers.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where the input layer order is not in line with the model layer order. This leads to incorrect deserialization and creation of the model layers, resulting in mismatched input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer.

To fix the bug, we should update the `process_node` function to handle the input order and shapes correctly, ensuring that the shared layers are created with the correct inputs.

The corrected code for the `from_config` method is as follows:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    def process_node(layer, node_data):
        input_tensors = []
        for input_data in node_data:
            inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
            inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
            inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
            if len(input_data) == 3:
                kwargs = {}
            elif len(input_data) == 4:
                kwargs = input_data[3]
            else:
                raise ValueError('Improperly formatted model config.')
            inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
            if inbound_layer is not None:
                inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
                input_tensors.append(inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])
        
        # Call layer on its inputs, thus creating the node and building the layer if needed
        if input_tensors:
            layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

The key changes include checking if the `inbound_layer` exists before using it, and then fetching the correct `inbound_node` and `input_tensors` to ensure that the shared layers are created with the correct inputs and shapes.
