The bug in the `from_config` function seems to be related to the processing of layers and nodes. It appears that the code is incorrectly processing the layers and nodes, resulting in unprocessed nodes and an empty `input_tensors` list when it should not be. 

The reason for this bug could be that the code is not properly handling the processing of layers and nodes, causing input tensors not to be added to the `input_tensors` list correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the processing of layers and nodes is done in the correct order, and that input tensors are correctly added to the `input_tensors` list during the processing of nodes.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` function:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (omitted code)

    # New code for processing layers and nodes
    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer in list(unprocessed_nodes.keys()):
            if layer in created_layers:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    name = config.get('name')
    # ... (omitted code)
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that all layers are processed before processing the nodes. Additionally, we process the nodes while checking if the inbound nodes exist, and correctly add input tensors to the `input_tensors` list during node processing. This should address the issue of unprocessed nodes and missing input tensors.
