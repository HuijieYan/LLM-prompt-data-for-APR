The potential error location within the problematic function is the `from_config` method, which is missing the `cls` parameter.

The error might occur due to the missing `cls` parameter in the `from_config` method, which should be a reference to the class. Without the `cls` parameter, the method cannot be called on the class itself.

To fix the bug, let's add the `cls` parameter to the `from_config` method and use it to create a new instance of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).

    # Arguments
        config: Model config dictionary.
        custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
            (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
            considered during deserialization.

    # Returns
        A model instance.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of improperly formatted config dict.
    """
    created_layers = {}
    unprocessed_nodes = {}

    def add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data):
        if layer not in unprocessed_nodes:
            unprocessed_nodes[layer] = [node_data]
        else:
            unprocessed_nodes[layer].append(node_data)

    # ... (other internal functions remain unchanged)

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the `cls` parameter is added to the `from_config` method, and it is used to create a new instance of the class by invoking `cls` with the specified parameters. This ensures that the method can be called on the class itself and resolves the bug.
