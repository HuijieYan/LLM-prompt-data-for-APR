The bug occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in the Keras library. This bug arises when loading a model from a config in a case where the model uses a layer that is shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file. The issue causes the model loading process to fail with a ValueError when a `Concatenate` layer requires inputs with matching shapes except for the concat axis, but the inputs have mismatched shapes.

The potential error location is within the `from_config` method, specifically in the `process_node` function where the input tensors are processed and used to call the layer.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to reorganize the order in which the nodes are processed to ensure that the shared layers and their input tensors are handled correctly. Additionally, it's important to maintain the correct order of input tensors for shared layers, especially when layer nodes are re-enqueued for processing due to unavailability of input tensors.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # [... other code ...]

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        layer = process_layer(layer_data, created_layers, unprocessed_nodes, custom_objects)
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data, created_layers, unprocessed_nodes)

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []
    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        output_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

The `process_node` and `process_layer` functions have been refactored as follows:

```python
def process_node(layer, node_data, created_layers, unprocessed_nodes):
    input_tensors = []
    for input_data in node_data:
        inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
        inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
        inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
        if len(input_data) == 3:
            kwargs = {}
        elif len(input_data) == 4:
            kwargs = input_data[3]
        else:
            raise ValueError('Improperly formatted model config.')
        inbound_layer = created_layers.get(inbound_layer_name)
        if inbound_layer is None:
            add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
            return
        if len(inbound_layer._inbound_nodes) <= inbound_node_index:
            add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
            return
        input_tensors.append(inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index].output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])
    if input_tensors:
        layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

def process_layer(layer_data, created_layers, unprocessed_nodes, custom_objects):
    layer_name = layer_data['name']

    # Gather layer inputs.
    inbound_nodes_data = layer_data['inbound_nodes']
    for node_data in inbound_nodes_data:
        # We don't process nodes (i.e. make layer calls)
        # on the fly because the inbound node may not yet exist,
        # in case of layer shared at different topological depths
        # (e.g. a model such as A(B(A(B(x)))))
        add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)

    # Create and store layer
    layer = deserialize_layer(layer_data, custom_objects=custom_objects)
    created_layers[layer_name] = layer
```

These changes ensure that shared layers and their input tensors are processed in the correct order, thereby addressing the bug in the model loading process.
