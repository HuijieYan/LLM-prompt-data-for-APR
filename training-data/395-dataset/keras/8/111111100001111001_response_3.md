The bug occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class. It appears that the `process_node` function is not being called correctly, leading to incorrect input tensors.

The bug may be occurring because the `inbound_layer._inbound_nodes` list is empty, which is causing the `input_tensors` list to remain empty as well. This is likely due to the incorrect initialization of layers or nodes, leading to an empty `inbound_nodes` list.

To fix the bug, the `process_node` function should be called with the correct layer and node_data. Additionally, proper initialization and setup of the layers and nodes should be ensured to avoid empty `inbound_nodes` lists.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... existing code ...

    def process_layer(layer_data):
        # existing code ...

        # Instantiate layer.
        from ..layers import deserialize as deserialize_layer
        layer = deserialize_layer(layer_data, custom_objects=custom_objects)
        created_layers[layer_name] = layer

        # Gather layer inputs.
        inbound_nodes_data = layer_data['inbound_nodes']
        for node_data in inbound_nodes_data:
            process_node(layer, node_data)  # Call process_node here to correctly process the node
            add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)  # Add unprocessed node if necessary

    # ...existing code...
```

With this modification, the `process_node` function should be called correctly, and the input_tensors list should be populated as expected.
