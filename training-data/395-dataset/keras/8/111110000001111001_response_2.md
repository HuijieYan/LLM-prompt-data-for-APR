The test case appears to involve creating layers and processing nodes and layers in a neural network. The expected variable values indicate the correct processing of nodes and layers and the creation of the unprocessed nodes.

The potential error location could be the implementation of the `process_node` function within the `from_config` method.

The bug might be occurring due to improper condition checks and processing of nodes within the `process_node` function. It seems that the node processing logic might not be functioning correctly, leading to the unprocessed nodes not being handled as expected.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the logic for processing nodes within the `process_node` function is correctly implemented. It should handle the input data, layer names, and indices properly to process the nodes effectively.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # Existing code ...

    def process_node(layer, node_data):
        input_tensors = []
        for input_data in node_data:
            inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
            inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
            inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
            kwargs = input_data[3] if len(input_data) > 3 else {}
            if inbound_layer_name in created_layers:
                inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
                if len(inbound_layer._inbound_nodes) > inbound_node_index:
                    inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
                    if inbound_tensor_index < len(inbound_node.output_tensors):
                        input_tensors.append(inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])
        if input_tensors:
            layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the `process_node` function checks if the inbound_layer_name exists in created_layers before further processing. It also ensures that the indices are within the bounds of the lists before accessing them. These checks should prevent the bug related to unprocessed nodes and ensure correct processing of nodes and layers in the neural network.
