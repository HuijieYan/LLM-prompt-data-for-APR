The problematic function is `from_config`.

The potential error location is within the while loop that processes unprocessed nodes. It appears that the loop continues to iterate over the same layers, but it should iterate over the unprocessed nodes.

The bug occurs because the while loop is not correctly processing the unprocessed nodes. It continues to iterate over all layers instead of just the unprocessed nodes.

To fix the bug, we should change the while loop to iterate over the unprocessed nodes and process them until there are no more unprocessed nodes left.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).

    # Arguments
        config: Model config dictionary.
        custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
            (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
            considered during deserialization.

    # Returns
        A model instance.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of improperly formatted config dict.
    """
    # Layer instances created during
    # the graph reconstruction process
    created_layers = {}

    # Dictionary mapping layer instances to
    # node data that specifies a layer call.
    # It acts as a queue that maintains any unprocessed
    # layer call until it becomes possible to process it
    # (i.e. until the input tensors to the call all exist).
    unprocessed_nodes = {}

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer in list(unprocessed_nodes.keys()):
            for node_data in unprocessed_nodes[layer]:
                process_node(layer, node_data)
            del unprocessed_nodes[layer]

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []
    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
