The error occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class when attempting to deserialize the layers. The bug is triggered when the model uses a layer that is shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file.

The issue arises because, during the deserialization process, the input layers are not available in the expected order, leading to the incorrect shapes of the input tensors, which in turn causes the error during the build process of the `Concatenate` layer.

To fix the bug, I would suggest reordering the deserialization process and ensuring that the input layers are processed in the correct order when creating the node data that specifies a layer call. This will require synchronization of input layer creation and processing logic to ensure that the correct input tensors are available when needed.

Here's the corrected `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other existing code)

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        layer = min(unprocessed_nodes, key=lambda k: len(unprocessed_nodes[k]))
        node_data_list = unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer)
        for node_data in node_data_list:
            process_node(layer, node_data)

    # ... (other existing code)
```

In this corrected code, after creating all layers and enqueuing nodes to be processed, we process the nodes in order of layer depth, with a priority given to layers with fewer unprocessed nodes. This should ensure that the input layers are available in the correct order during the deserialization process, addressing the issue of incorrect input shapes and resolving the bug.
