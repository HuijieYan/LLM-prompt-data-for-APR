The error occurs when the `Model.from_config` method is used to load a model from its config. The issue arises when a shared layer is used at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file. This causes a ValueError in the `Concatenate` layer in the model due to inputs with non-matching shapes.

The error is likely occurring in the `process_node` function within the `Model.from_config` method, specifically when attempting to apply the layer to its inputs. This is causing the inputs to have non-matching shapes, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the `unpack_singleton` helper function should be used to ensure that the input tensors are in the correct shape before they are used as inputs to the layer.

Below is the corrected code for the `Model.from_config` method with modifications to handle the shared layer inputs and avoid the ValueError:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_8/keras/engine/network.py

@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other functions and variables) ...

    def process_node(layer, node_data):
        input_tensors = []
        for input_data in node_data:
            inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
            inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
            inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
            if len(input_data) == 3:
                kwargs = {}
            elif len(input_data) == 4:
                kwargs = input_data[3]
            else:
                raise ValueError('Improperly formatted model config.')
            inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
            if len(inbound_layer._inbound_nodes) <= inbound_node_index:
                add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
                return
            inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
            input_tensors.append(
                inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])

        # Use unpack_singleton to ensure correct input shapes
        input_shape = layer.compute_output_shape(unpack_singleton(input_tensors)).as_list()
        if len(input_tensors) > 1:
            input_tensors = [tf.keras.backend.reshape(t, input_shape[1:]) for t in input_tensors]

        # Call layer on its inputs, thus creating the node
        # and building the layer if needed.
        if input_tensors:
            layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

    # ... (remaining code as in the original function) ...
```

In the corrected `process_node` function, the `unpack_singleton` function is used to ensure that the input tensors have matching shapes before they are used as inputs to the layer. Additionally, the input tensors are reshaped to match the expected input shape if there are multiple input tensors. This approach should prevent the ValueError from occurring and resolve the bug in the `Model.from_config` method.
