The bug occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in the Keras library. When the method tries to recreate the model, it may not process the layers with shared inputs in the correct order, resulting in an incorrect model configuration. This can cause a concatenation layer to receive inputs with mismatched shapes, triggering the ValueError. The bug is related to the order of applying the shared layers.

To fix the bug, the `from_config` method needs to be updated to ensure that it processes the layers with shared inputs in the correct order. This can be achieved by modifying the logic of how unprocessed nodes are handled, making sure that the input tensors to the shared layers are processed in the correct order.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in the correct order, ensuring that
    # the shared layers are processed with their inputs in the correct order.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                # Process the layer nodes in the correct order
                node_data_list = unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer)
                for node_data in node_data_list:
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    # ... (remaining code) ...
```

With this correction, the `from_config` method will process the layers and their nodes in the correct order, ensuring that the shared layers receive their inputs in the expected sequence and avoiding the ValueError triggered by the concatenation layer.
