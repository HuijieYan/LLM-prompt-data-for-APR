The error occurs during the deserialization process of a model from its config. It seems that the bug is triggered when the model uses a layer that is shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file.

The potential error location seems to be within the `process_node` function, where input shapes are being used to create a `Concatenate` layer. It seems that the input tensors don't have matching shapes, leading to a ValueError.

The bug is occurring because the input tensors provided to the `Concatenate` layer do not have matching shapes, except for the concat axis, as expected by the `Concatenate` layer. This mismatch in input shapes is causing the ValueError to be raised.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the input tensors passed to the `Concatenate` layer have matching shapes, except for the concat axis. This may involve reordering the input tensors when creating the `Concatenate` layer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # Previous implementation

    # ... (existing code)

    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []
    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.extend(layer_output_tensors)  # Extend the list of input tensors
    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        output_tensors.extend(layer_output_tensors)  # Extend the list of output tensors
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the need for checking shape matching as it will be automatically handled during the `Concatenate` layer creation process. We have also replaced the individual addition of input and output tensors with the extend method to combine the tensors into a single list, ensuring that they are properly ordered and shaped when passed into the model.
