Potential Error:
The error occurs in the `from_config` class method of the `Network` class, specifically in the `process_node` function. There are issues with nodes being processed out of order, which leads to incomplete processing of the graph.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not properly processing the layer nodes and their dependencies. This leads to nodes being processed out of order, causing incomplete initialization and processing of the layers.

Possible Approaches:
1. Use a topological sorting algorithm to correctly order the nodes based on their dependencies before processing.
2. Implement a mechanism to track the processing status of nodes and ensure that dependencies are processed before a given node.

Corrected Code:
```python
def process_node(layer, node_data, processed_nodes):
    input_tensors = []
    for input_data in node_data:
        inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
        inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
        inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
        if len(input_data) == 3:
            kwargs = {}
        elif len(input_data) == 4:
            kwargs = input_data[3]
        else:
            raise ValueError('Improperly formatted model config.')
        inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
        if inbound_layer not in processed_nodes or processed_nodes[inbound_layer] <= inbound_node_index:
            add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
        else:
            inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
            input_tensors.append(
                inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])
    # Call layer on its inputs, thus creating the node
    # and building the layer if needed.
    if input_tensors:
        layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    processed_nodes = {}
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data, processed_nodes)
                    if layer not in processed_nodes:
                        processed_nodes[layer] = 1
                    else:
                        processed_nodes[layer] += 1

    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
