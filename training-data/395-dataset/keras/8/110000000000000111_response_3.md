The error is occurring in the `from_config` method of the Keras Network class when loading a model with shared layers at multiple depths. The issue is related to the order in which the layers are created and deserialized. 

The bug occurs in the `process_node` function when calling `layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)`. The bug arises from the fact that Keras tries to create the first output before the input layers are available, resulting in the incorrect order of output nodes.

To fix the bug, the order of layer creation must be adjusted to ensure that layers are not deserialized before their input layers are available.

Here is the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # code to create and process layers
    ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed in order of dependency
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    
    # Then we process nodes in order of dependency
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
        if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
            for node_data in unprocessed_nodes[layer]:
                process_node(layer, node_data)

    # code to handle names, input and output tensors, and return model instance
    ...
```

By processing the layers and nodes in order of their dependencies, we ensure that each layer's inputs are available before attempting to deserialize and create the layer. This fixes the bug that occurs when creating models with shared layers across multiple levels.
