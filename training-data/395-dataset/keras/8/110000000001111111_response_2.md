The error occurs in the `from_config` method of the Keras Network class when loading a model from a config that uses a shared layer at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file. This results in the incorrect ordering of input and output nodes for the dense layer, causing a ValueError when the Concatenate layer tries to combine inputs with mismatched shapes.

To fix the bug, the process of queuing up unprocessed nodes and layers should be modified to ensure that the layer calls are made in the correct order, taking into account shared layers and their inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).
    <add docstring here>
    """
    # Initialize dictionaries for created layers and unprocessed nodes
    created_layers = {}
    unprocessed_nodes = {}

    def add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data):
        if layer not in unprocessed_nodes:
            unprocessed_nodes[layer] = [node_data]
        else:
            unprocessed_nodes[layer].append(node_data)

    def process_node(layer, node_data):
        if not layer in unprocessed_nodes:
            unprocessed_nodes[layer] = [node_data]
        else:
            unprocessed_nodes[layer].append(node_data)

    def process_layer(layer_data):
        layer_name = layer_data['name']
        from keras.layers import deserialize as deserialize_layer  # assuming keras is imported as keras
        layer = deserialize_layer(layer_data, custom_objects=custom_objects)
        created_layers[layer_name] = layer

        inbound_nodes_data = layer_data['inbound_nodes']
        for node_data in inbound_nodes_data:
            process_node(layer, node_data)

    # First, create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Process nodes in order of layer depth
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer in list(unprocessed_nodes):  # Use list to allow modifying unprocessed_nodes while iterating
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes[layer]:
                    input_tensors = []
                    for input_data in node_data:
                        inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
                        inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
                        inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
                        if len(input_data) == 3:
                            kwargs = {}
                        elif len(input_data) == 4:
                            kwargs = input_data[3]
                        else:
                            raise ValueError('Improperly formatted model config.')
                        inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
                        if inbound_layer in unprocessed_nodes:  # Check if inbound layer is unprocessed
                            process_node(layer, node_data)  # Re-enqueue the current node for later
                            break
                        inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
                        input_tensors.append(inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])

                    if not unprocessed_nodes.get(layer):  # If all dependencies are resolved, process the node
                        layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)
                        unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer)

    # Collect input and output tensors and return the model instance
    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = [created_layers[layer_data[0]].output for layer_data in config['input_layers']]
    output_tensors = [created_layers[layer_data[0]].output for layer_data in config['output_layers']]
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the process of creating layers and processing nodes has been modified to ensure that the layer calls are made in the correct order, taking into account shared layers and their inputs. Additionally, a check has been added to avoid processing unprocessed nodes if any of their dependencies are still unprocessed. This ensures that the ordering of input and output nodes for shared layers is maintained, preventing the ValueError described in the bug report.
