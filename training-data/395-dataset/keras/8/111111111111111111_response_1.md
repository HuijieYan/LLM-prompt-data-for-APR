The bug occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in the `keras/engine/network.py` file when deserializing a model from its config. The bug triggers a ValueError at the `Concatenate` layer due to mismatched input shapes.

The problem seems to occur in the `from_config` method during the deserialization process. Specifically, the issue arises when processing shared layers at different depths. The input tensors are not processed in the correct order, causing mismatched input shapes at the `Concatenate` layer.

To fix this bug, the order in which input tensors are processed needs to be carefully managed, ensuring that the shared layers are handled correctly, even across different depths in the model.

Below is the corrected code for the `from_config` method of the `Network` class:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    layer_indices = {layer_data['name']: idx for idx, layer_data in enumerate(config['layers'])}

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        if 'inbound_nodes' in layer_data:
            for node_data in layer_data['inbound_nodes']:
                inbound_layer_name = node_data[0][0]
                node_depth = layer_indices[layer_data['name']]
                inbound_layer_depth = layer_indices[inbound_layer_name]
                if node_depth < inbound_layer_depth:
                    add_unprocessed_node(created_layers[inbound_layer_name], node_data)

    # Then we process shared nodes and nodes at lower depths
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = [created_layers[layer_data[0]].output for layer_data in config['input_layers']]
    output_tensors = [created_layers[layer_data[0]].output for layer_data in config['output_layers']]
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

The corrected code introduces additional management of the layer processing order by considering the depth of each layer and its inbound nodes. This ensures that shared layers are correctly processed, preventing mismatched input shapes at the `Concatenate` layer.
