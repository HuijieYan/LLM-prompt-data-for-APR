The bug occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in Keras. The issue arises when loading a model from a configuration where the model uses a layer that is shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order specified in the model config file.

The bug is caused by the logic in the `process_node` function, where it attempts to create the node for the layer using the input tensors. If the input tensors are not available, it re-enqueues the node for processing later. This re-enqueuing happens before the input layers are available, leading to incorrect order in the output nodes of the layer, causing the model loading to fail at a later stage.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `process_node` function needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input tensors are available before attempting to create the node for the layer.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in Keras:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                node_data_list = unprocessed_nodes[layer]
                for node_data in node_data_list:
                    can_process = True
                    for input_data in node_data:
                        inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
                        if inbound_layer_name not in created_layers:
                            can_process = False
                            break
                    if can_process:
                        process_node(layer, node_data)
                        unprocessed_nodes[layer].remove(node_data)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the corrected code, before processing each node, we check if all the input layers for that node have been created. If all input layers are available, we can proceed to process the node. If not, we keep the node in the unprocessed queue and try again later.

This approach ensures that all input tensors are available before attempting to create the node for the layer, preventing incorrect ordering of output nodes and resolving the bug.
