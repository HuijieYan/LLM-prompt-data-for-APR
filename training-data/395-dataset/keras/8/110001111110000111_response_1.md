The error is likely occurring in the `from_config` method of the `keras/engine/network.py` file. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `Concatenate` layer requiring inputs with matching shapes, but the provided inputs have different shapes.

The reason behind the bug is that the layers are being reconstructed in the order they appear in the config, which causes issues when shared layers have a different order of input tensors than defined in the config.

To fix the bug, the approach could involve reordering the process of creating layers and their nodes in the `from_config` method such that shared layers are processed in a way that respects the correct order of input tensors.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth, accounting for shared layers
    processed_nodes = set()

    def process_nodes_for_layer(layer):
        if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
            for node_data in unprocessed_nodes[layer]:
                if all(inbound_layer_name in created_layers for inbound_layer_name, _, _ in node_data):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)
                    processed_nodes.add((layer, node_data))

    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            process_nodes_for_layer(layer)
        # Remove processed nodes
        for layer, node_data in processed_nodes:
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes and node_data in unprocessed_nodes[layer]:
                unprocessed_nodes[layer].remove(node_data)
            if not unprocessed_nodes[layer]:
                del unprocessed_nodes[layer]

    # ... (previous code) ...
```

In the corrected code, the `while` loop processes the nodes in each layer and accounts for shared layers. The `processed_nodes` set keeps track of which nodes have been processed to avoid reprocessing. By reordering the processing and keeping track of processed nodes, the issue with shared layers and the order of input tensors is addressed.
