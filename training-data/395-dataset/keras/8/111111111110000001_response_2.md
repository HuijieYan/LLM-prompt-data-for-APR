The test case involves creating a model with two reshape layers and merging their outputs using `layers.concatenate`. The bug occurs when converting the model back from its configuration using `Model.from_config(config)`.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` within the `Concatenate` layer, specifically related to the mismatch in input shapes.

The potential error location within the `from_config` method of the Network class is the order in which unprocessed nodes are processed. This can lead to a situation where the input shapes of the layers are not properly handled, causing a mismatch in shapes.

The bug occurs because the unprocessed nodes are not handled properly and lead to a mismatch in input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer, which results in a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, the approach involves reorganizing the logic for processing unprocessed nodes and ensuring that the input shapes are properly handled.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """
    Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).

    Arguments:
        config: Model config dictionary.
        custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
            (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
            considered during deserialization.

    Returns:
        A model instance.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: In case of improperly formatted config dict.
    """
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    processed_nodes = set()
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes[layer]:
                    input_tensors = process_node(layer, node_data, created_layers)
                    processed_nodes.add((layer, node_data))
    
    inputs = [tensor for layer_data in config['input_layers'] for tensor in layer_data[0]]
    outputs = [tensor for layer_data in config['output_layers'] for tensor in layer_data[0]]
    return cls(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the unprocessed nodes are properly handled, and the input shapes are processed for each node to ensure they match properly, preventing the `ValueError` related to the mismatching input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer.
