The error occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in the `keras/engine/network.py` file. The error is triggered when attempting to use a `Concatenate` layer with inputs of different shapes, leading to a `ValueError`.

The bug occurs because the `from_config` method attempts to process the network's nodes in a specific order without ensuring that the input layers are available in the correct order. This causes the layers to be deserialized and created in an incorrect order, leading to mismatched shapes for the `Concatenate` layer inputs.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the code in the `from_config` method to ensure that the layers are deserialized and created in the correct order, considering the availability of input layers. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the creation of shared layers at different topological depths.

Here is the corrected code for the `from_config` method in the `keras/engine/network.py` file:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # --- Other code remains unchanged ---

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    # --- Rest of the code remains unchanged ---
```

With this correction, the `from_config` method processes the network nodes in the correct order, ensuring that the layers are deserialized and created with the availability of input layers considered. This should resolve the issue of mismatched shapes for the `Concatenate` layer inputs.
