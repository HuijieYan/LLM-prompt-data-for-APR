The error occurs when the `process_node` function tries to build the `Concatenate` layer with input shapes `[(None, 12), (None, 1, 12)]` which are not compatible. This leads to a `ValueError` as the `Concatenate` layer requires inputs with matching shapes except for the concatenated axis. 

The reason behind this bug is that the layers are being reconstructed using the model's config, and during this process, the order of applying the layers might differ, leading to mismatched input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer. 

To fix this bug, the logic of processing the layers and nodes in the `from_config` method needs to be modified to ensure that layers are processed in the correct order to avoid input shape mismatches.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:
```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # Existing code here

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    # in topological order
    layer_depths = {}
    current_depth = 0

    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
        layer_depths[layer_data['name']] = current_depth
        current_depth += 1

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    unprocessed_nodes = {}
    while config['layers']:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            ready = True
            for node_data in layer_data['inbound_nodes']:
                for input_data in node_data:
                    if layer_depths[input_data[0]] > layer_depths[layer_data['name']]:
                        ready = False
                        add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
                        break
                if not ready:
                    break
            if ready:
                process_node(layer, node_data)
            else:
                unprocessed_nodes[layer] = node_data
        if not unprocessed_nodes:
            break

    # Remaining part of the code remains the same
```

By ensuring that layers are processed in topological order based on their dependencies, the correct input shapes will be available when processing the nodes, thus preventing mismatches during the construction of the model from its config.
