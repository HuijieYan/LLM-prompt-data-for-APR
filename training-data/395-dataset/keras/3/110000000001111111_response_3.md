The error occurs in the `_clone_functional_model` function, specifically when computing the output tensors for the cloned model. The error message "Could not compute output Tensor" suggests that the output tensors are not being properly computed.

The bug seems to be related to the `layer.compute_mask(...)` method returning None, which causes the `output_masks` to always be [None]. This behavior occurs when a layer (in this case, Lambda) doesn't support using masks.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to modify the code to handle cases where the layer does not support masks. This could involve checking if the layer supports masking before attempting to compute the mask, and handling the case accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... existing function comments ...

    # existing code ...

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # existing code ...

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code ...

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
                    computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
                else:
                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # Updated to handle only tensors

    # ... existing code ...

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)  # Update to use updated output_tensors
```

In the corrected code, the handling of masks is removed, and only output tensors are considered for mapping. This modification addresses the issue of Lambda layers not supporting masks and should resolve the "Could not compute output Tensor" error.
