The test function `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is calling `keras.models.clone_model` to clone a functional model. The error message indicates an assertion failure, reporting that the output tensor from the original model could not be computed.

The bug is likely located in the `_clone_functional_model` method, specifically in the logic responsible for transferring the tensor and mask mapping from the original model to the cloned model.

The error occurs because the function fails to properly track and map the tensors and masks from the original model to the newly cloned model. This leads to an assertion failure when attempting to compute the output tensors of the original model as it cannot find their corresponding mapping in the cloned model.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for mapping tensors and masks from the original model to the new cloned model. Additional checks and adjustments should be made to ensure that the transfer of tensors and masks is done accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` method:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (rest of the method remains unchanged)

    # Remove the previous tensor_map to create a new mapping for the cloned model
    tensor_map = {}

    # Re-populate tensor_map with the new mapping for the cloned model
    for orig_input, new_input in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[orig_input] = new_input

    model_config = model.get_config()
    new_model = Model.from_config(model_config)

    # Add the mapped input tensors to the new model
    for i, input_layer in enumerate(new_model._input_layers):
        input_layer._inbound_nodes[0].input_tensors = [input_tensors[i]]

    # Set the output tensor mapping for the new model
    for orig_output in model.outputs:
        new_model.add_tensor_to_output(tensor_map[orig_output])

    return new_model
```

In the corrected code, we reconstruct the tensor mapping between the original model and the newly cloned model. We then instantiate a new model using the configuration of the original model, while updating the input and output tensors based on the mapping established.
