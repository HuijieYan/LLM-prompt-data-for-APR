The error message indicates that there is an assertion failure in the `_clone_functional_model` function. Specifically, the assertion `assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)` has failed.

The potential error location is likely related to how the `tensor_map` is being populated and used, particularly when handling multiple inputs and outputs for a layer. It seems that during the iteration over the nodes in the reference model, the `tensor_map` is not being updated correctly to compute the model outputs.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the multiple outputs generated by the `SwapLayer` and is failing to update the `tensor_map` accordingly.

To fix the bug, the approach should involve ensuring that the `tensor_map` is correctly updated and that the computation of model outputs handles the case of multiple outputs from a layer.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """
    Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs, except that it creates new layers
    (and thus new weights) instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers.
