The bug appears to be occurring in the function `_clone_functional_model` from the file `models.py`. One potential error location is within the for loop that iterates over every node in the reference model, in depth order.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to issues in the logic for reusing previously cloned layers and calling the layer with the computed input tensors. There might be problems with tensor mapping and layer cloning.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the logic for reusing previously cloned layers and ensure that the tensor mapping is handled correctly. Additionally, the conditions for calling the layer with the computed input tensors should be revisited to ensure proper handling of input tensors and masks.

Here's the corrected code for the function `_clone_functional_model`:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # Previous implementation...

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=False)  # Alter the sorting order
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]

            computed_data = []  # List to store input data
            for x in node.input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(node.input_tensors):
                # Call layer with computed input tensors.
                input_data = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(input_data, **kwargs))

                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = y

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        output_tensors.append(tensor_map[x])
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
