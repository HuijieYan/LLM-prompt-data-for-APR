The error occurs due to an issue in the `_clone_functional_model` function. 

The function iterates through the nodes in the model and creates or reuses layers, but it fails to handle the case when the layer is an `InputLayer`. As a result, the function encounters an error when dealing with an `InputLayer` object.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to skip the `InputLayer` when encountered during the iteration. Additionally, we should ensure that the `node.input_tensors` and `node.output_tensors` are appropriately handled, especially for the `InputLayer`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """
    Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
