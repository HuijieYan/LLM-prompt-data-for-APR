The potential error in the code is occurring in the section where the function `_clone_functional_model` is creating a new layer. This is because the `layer.get_config` method is not being appropriately utilized, resulting in the new layer not being instantiated correctly.

The bug occurs because the `layer.get_config` method is not used correctly to instantiate a new layer. This method should be used to obtain the configuration of the layer and create a new layer based on that configuration.

To fix the bug, the `layer.get_config` method should be called with parentheses to obtain the configuration of the layer. Then, a new layer can be instantiated using the obtained configuration. 

Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.

    Model cloning is similar to calling a model on new inputs,
    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

    # Arguments
        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument '
                         'to be a functional `Model` instance, '
                         'got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # existing code ...

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                layer_config = layer.get_config()
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer_config)
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer

                layer = layer_map[layer]

                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # rest of the code ...
