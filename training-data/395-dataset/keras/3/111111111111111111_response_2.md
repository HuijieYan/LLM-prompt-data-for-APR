The error occurs when the `clone_model` function is called in the test case. This function internally calls the `_clone_functional_model` method, which throws an assertion error when checking if the model outputs are in the `tensor_map`. 

The potential error location is identified in the `_clone_functional_model` method where it checks for the model outputs in the `tensor_map`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the model outputs are not being correctly computed and stored in the `tensor_map`. This is caused by the way the method is creating and mapping input tensors and layers, as well as not properly handling the layers with multiple outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the model outputs are correctly computed and added to the `tensor_map` during the layer iteration.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Add the following section to iterate over model outputs and update tensor_map
    for x, y in zip(model.outputs, output_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, we make sure to update `tensor_map` with the model outputs as well, matching them with the corresponding output tensors.

With this fix, the model outputs are correctly added to the `tensor_map`, and the error should no longer occur when using `clone_model` with a model that has multiple outputs.
