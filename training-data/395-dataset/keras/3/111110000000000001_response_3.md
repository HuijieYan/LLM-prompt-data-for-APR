The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that handles the creation and cloning of layers and input tensors. The error likely occurs because of incorrect handling of input tensors and layers during the cloning process.

The bug probably exists due to incorrect handling of input tensors and layers, leading to issues in the cloning of the model. This could result in the function not behaving as intended and potentially causing errors when trying to reproduce the behavior of the original model with new input tensors and newly instantiated weights.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the creation and cloning of layers and input tensors. This can be achieved by ensuring that the input tensors and layers are properly mapped and duplicated during the cloning process to avoid any conflicts or errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # Create a new model based on the original model
    cloned_model = tf.keras.models.clone_model(model)

    return cloned_model
```
