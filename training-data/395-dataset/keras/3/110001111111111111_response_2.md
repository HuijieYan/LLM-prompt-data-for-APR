The main issue with the `_clone_functional_model` function is its failure to properly handle the multi-output scenario where the Lambda layer doesn't support using masks. This leads to the `output_masks` being always `None` instead of the expected `[None, None]`. As a result, when trying to compute the output tensors for the new model, the function encounters the assertion error because it couldn't compute the output tensor.

To fix this bug, the `_clone_functional_model` function needs to be modified to properly handle the absence of masks in the multi-output scenario. This can be done by checking the layer type and its mask support to correctly compute and assign the output masks for each layer.

Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... other existing code ...

    # Updated code to handle mask computation
    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # ... existing code ...

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... existing code ...
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # ... existing code ...
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

                # Updated code to handle masks
                if layer.supports_masking:
                    output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                else:
                    output_masks = [None] * len(output_tensors)

                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # ... existing code ...
```

This modified code adds a check for `layer.supports_masking` to handle the mask computation based on the layer's mask support. If the layer supports masking, the `output_masks` are computed accordingly. If the layer doesn't support masking, the `output_masks` are set to `None` for each output tensor.

By making these changes, the function will be able to correctly handle the multi-output scenario without mask support and avoid the assertion error encountered in the test case.
