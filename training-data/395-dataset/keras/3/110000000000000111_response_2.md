Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_clone_functional_model` function, specifically in the loop where it gathers inputs to call the new layer. It seems that the error is related to the handling of output masks for layers that do not support masks, leading to the assertion error and the bug.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring due to the incorrect handling of output masks when a layer does not support masks, particularly with the Lambda layer which does not support masks. This leads to the assertion error stating "Could not compute output Tensor".

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the current layer supports masks before attempting to compute the masks.
2. If the layer does not support masks, handle the output masks differently to avoid the assertion error.
3. Update the logic for gathering inputs and calling the new layer to account for layers that do not support masks.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
    
    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask
    
    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                if node.arguments:
                    kwargs = node.arguments
                else:
                    kwargs = {}
                
                # Update: handle the case where layer does not support masks
                if not has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    kwargs['mask'] = None
                
                # Rest of the code remains unchanged
                # ...
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
