The error occurs when trying to clone a functional model using the `clone_model` function from the `keras.models` module. The `clone_model` function calls the `_clone_functional_model` function internally.

The error message indicates that the issue is related to the computation of the output tensor in the `_clone_functional_model` function. Specifically, the error is triggered when the `assert x in tensor_map` statement fails.

Upon further analysis, it's identified that the issue arises from the way the tensor map is being populated during the cloning process. This is likely due to the specific structure of the model being cloned, especially in cases where there are multiple inputs and outputs with complex data flows between layers.

To resolve the issue, the approach would be to carefully review the logic for populating the `tensor_map` and ensure that it accurately reflects the data flow within the model.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_clone_functional_model` method:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(shape=layer.output_shape[1:]) for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, InputLayer)]

    for original_input, new_input in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[original_input] = (new_input, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for layer in model.layers:
        inbound_nodes = layer._inbound_nodes
        for node in inbound_nodes:
            input_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in node.inbound_layers]
            kwargs = node.arguments
            computed_data = []

            for x in input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(input_tensors):
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, _ = computed_data[0]
                else:
                    computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]

                output_tensors = layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs)

                if not isinstance(output_tensors, list):
                    output_tensors = [output_tensors]

                for x, y in zip(node.output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The input tensors are initialized by creating placeholder inputs based on the output shape of the layers in the original model.
2. For each layer in the original model, a new layer is created based on the configuration of the original layer, and it is added to `layer_map`.
3. The data flow through the layers is computed, and the `tensor_map` is updated accordingly.
4. Finally, the output tensors for the new model are determined based on the updated `tensor_map`.

This correction ensures that the cloning process accurately reflects the data flow in the original model, resolving the error encountered during the computation of the output tensors.
