The error occurs when trying to access a list element that is out of range in the TensorShape object within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function, which is called from the `ctc_batch_cost` function. This suggests that the issue might be related to the dimensionality or shape of the input tensors `y_true` and `label_length`.

The bug is likely caused by an incorrect definition or manipulation of the input tensors `y_true` and `label_length` within the `c ctc_batch_cost` function. This is causing issues when using these tensors to calculate `sparse_labels` in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.

To fix the bug, the input tensors `y_true` and `label_length` should be carefully inspected to ensure that their shapes and dimensions are appropriate for the calculations being performed within the `ctc_batch_cost` function.

Additionally, potential fixes to the code could include:
1. Checking the shapes of `y_true` and `label_length` to ensure they match the expected input format for the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.
2. Handling cases where the shape or dimensions of the input tensors do not match the expected format, possibly by reshaping or modifying the input tensors.
3. Ensuring that the data type of the input tensors is compatible with the operations being performed, using appropriate casting functions if necessary.
