The error message indicates an IndexError in the `__getitem__` method of the `TensorShape` class. This error stems from the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function within the `ctc_batch_cost` function in the `keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py` file. 

The root cause of the bug seems to be related to the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function being used within the `ctc_batch_cost` function. The error message indicates that the `key` used to access the dimension of the `TensorShape` is out of range, suggesting that the dimensions or shape of the input are not as expected.

One potential reason for this bug could be that the dimensions of the input (`y_true` and `label_length`) are not compatible with the operations performed inside the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` and subsequent operations.  

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure that the input dimensions of `y_true` and `label_length` are compatible with the operations inside the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.
2. Check if the output of `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` is as expected and compatible with subsequent operations.
3. Validate the dimensions and shapes of the inputs to prevent any out-of-range index errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops import ctc_ops

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1)
    sparse_labels = ctc_ops.dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + 1e-8)

    loss = ctc_ops.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels, logits=y_pred, label_length=label_length, logit_length=input_length, logits_time_major=False)

    return tf.expand_dims(loss, axis=1)
```

In this corrected version of the `ctc_batch_cost` function, the code has been modified to use TensorFlow's `ctc_ops` for dense to sparse conversion and ctc loss calculation. Additionally, the indexing issues have been addressed, and the `log` function has been replaced with `tf.math.log`.
