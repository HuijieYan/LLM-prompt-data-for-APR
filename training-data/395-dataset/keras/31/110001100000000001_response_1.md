The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line where `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function is being called. The error occurs because the function `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` is not a part of the code provided, and the way it is trying to convert `y_true` and `label_length` to sparse labels is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to call a non-existent function `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` and performing operations on it. To fix the bug, we need to implement the logic to convert `y_true` and `label_length` to sparse labels within the `ctc_batch_cost` function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected ctc_batch_cost function
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    import tensorflow as tf

    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=-1)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=-1)

    # convert y_true and label_length to sparse labels
    batch_size = tf.shape(y_true)[0]
    max_string_length = tf.shape(y_true)[1]

    indices = tf.where(tf.sequence_mask(label_length, max_string_length))
    sparse_labels = tf.SparseTensor(indices, tf.gather_nd(y_true, indices), tf.shape(y_true, out_type=tf.int64))

    # compute ctc loss
    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))
    loss = tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels, logits=y_pred, label_length=label_length, logit_length=input_length, blank_index=-1)
    
    return tf.expand_dims(loss, axis=-1)
```

In the corrected code, we have implemented the logic to convert `y_true` and `label_length` to sparse labels using TensorFlow's built-in functions. We have also used TensorFlow's `ctc_loss` function to compute the CTC loss.
