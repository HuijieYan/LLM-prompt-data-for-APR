The test case is attempting to evaluate the `ctc_batch_cost` function, but it is encountering an error related to indexing out of bounds in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. The error message indicates that the issue is occurring in the `scan` function, within the `functional_ops.py` file.

The potential error location is within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function, where the `sparse_labels` variable is being created. The error message suggests that the issue may be related to indexing out of bounds.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the indexing of the dimensions when creating the `sparse_labels` variable. Since the error occurs specifically when the batch size is 1, it may indicate an issue with handling single-sample batches.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indexing for creating the `sparse_labels` variable is handled correctly, especially when the batch size is 1. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle single-sample batches in a specific way to avoid the indexing issue.

The corrected code for the problematic function `ctc_batch_cost` is provided below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.cast(tf.squeeze(label_length), tf.int32)
    input_length = tf.cast(tf.squeeze(input_length), tf.int32)
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.to_dense(tf.to_int32(tf.contrib.layers.dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                        inputs=y_pred,
                                        sequence_length=input_length,
                                        preprocess_collapse_repeated=False,
                                        ctc_merge_repeated=True), 1)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We use `tf.cast` to convert the `label_length` and `input_length` to `tf.int32`.
2. We use `tf.contrib.layers.dense_to_sparse` along with `tf.sparse.to_dense` to create the `sparse_labels` variable, handling the sparse representation of the true labels.
3. We use `tf.nn.ctc_loss` function instead of `ctc.ctc_loss` to calculate the CTC loss with the appropriate parameters.
4. We have also removed the use of `epsilon()` function, assuming it was a placeholder for a small value to avoid numerical instability. If needed, a suitable small value can be directly added to `tf.log` operation.
