The given function `ctc_batch_cost` is throwing a `NameError` because `tf` and `ctc` are not defined. It seems that these libraries are not imported in the code. Also, the function `epsilon()` is being called without being defined or imported.

To fix this bug:
1. Import the necessary libraries such as Tensorflow as `tf` and other required modules.
2. Define or import the `epsilon()` function if it is not already available in the library.
3. Ensure that the required methods such as `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` and `ctc_loss` are available in the imported libraries.

Here's the corrected function with the necessary imports and assumptions about the `epsilon()` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib import ctc

def epsilon():
    # Define the epsilon function if not already available
    pass

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc.ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
