The error occurs when the `ctc_batch_cost()` function is called with a batch size of 1. The error message indicates that there is an index out of range issue when trying to access the dimensions of the tensor shape.

The potential error location is within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse()` function where the tensor shape dimensions are being accessed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling the edge case of batch size 1 properly, which leads to an index out of range issue when accessing tensor shape dimensions.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the edge case of batch size 1 explicitly within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse()` function. This would involve checking for the batch size and handling it separately to avoid the index out of range issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras import backend as K
from keras.backend.tensorflow_backend import ctc_label_dense_to_sparse

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + K.epsilon())

    if K.int_shape(y_true)[0] == 1:  # Handling batch size 1
        y_true = tf.squeeze(y_true, axis=0)
        label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=0)

    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.keras.backend.ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the edge case of batch size 1 by checking the batch size and squeezing the tensors accordingly before proceeding with the rest of the computations. This should resolve the index out of range issue when using online training with batch size 1.
