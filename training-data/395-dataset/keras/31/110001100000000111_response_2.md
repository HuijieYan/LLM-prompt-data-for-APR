Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the line `y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())`, where the `tf.transpose` function is being used.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug may be caused by the incorrect usage of the `tf.transpose` function or by incorrect input dimensions for the `y_pred` tensor.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the dimensions of the `y_pred` tensor are correct for the `tf.transpose` operation.
2. Validate the usage of `tf.transpose` function and ensure that the permutation is correctly specified.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
        CTC loss of each element.
    """
    epsilon = 1e-8  # Add a small epsilon value to avoid log(0) error
    label_length = tf.squeeze(tf.cast(label_length, tf.int32))
    input_length = tf.squeeze(tf.cast(input_length, tf.int32))
    sparse_labels = tf.cast(tf.contrib.layers.dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length), tf.int64)

    y_pred_transposed = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon)

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels, inputs=y_pred_transposed, sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```
Note: 
- I have added a small epsilon value to the log operation to avoid log(0) error.
- I have used `tf.cast` to explicitly convert the input lengths to `tf.int32` data type.
- I have replaced the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function with `tf.contrib.layers.dense_to_sparse` for creating sparse labels.
- I have used `tf.nn.ctc_loss` instead of `ctc.ctc_loss` for the CTC loss calculation, as it is a part of TensorFlow's official API.
