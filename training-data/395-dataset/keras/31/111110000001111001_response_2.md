The issue in the provided code is that it is using TensorFlow (tf) operations and variables without importing the TensorFlow library or using the appropriate aliases. Additionally, the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` and `ctc` functions are being used without the required TensorFlow library or alias as well.

To fix this, we need to import the TensorFlow library and use the appropriate aliases for the functions. We also need to add the missing `epsilon` constant during logarithm operation.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib import ctc

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(tf.contrib.ctc.ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + tf.constant(1e-8))

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred, labels=sparse_labels, sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```
