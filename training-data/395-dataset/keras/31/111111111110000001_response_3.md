The error occurs when the function `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` is called within the `ctc_batch_cost` function in the `tensorflow_backend.py` file. The error message indicates an `IndexError` related to list index out of range.

The issue likely arises from using the wrong key to access the dimensions of the tensor shape, resulting in an index that is out of range. This may be due to incorrect handling of the tensor shape or dimensions.

To fix the bug, the key used to access the dimensions of the tensor shape should be validated to ensure it falls within the correct range. Additionally, the tensor shapes and dimensions should be handled consistently and checked for consistency to avoid index out of range errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    import tensorflow as tf
    from keras.backend import ctc
    epsilon = 1e-7  # Add a small value to avoid log(0)
    
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=-1)  # Remove the extra axis
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=-1)  # Remove the extra axis
    sparse_labels = ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)  # Removed unnecessary tf.to_int32 conversion

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon)

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(y_true, y_pred, input_length, sparse_labels), 1)  # Fixed the input parameter order
```

In the corrected code:
1. The unnecessary `tf.to_int32` conversions are removed, and `tf.squeeze` is used instead.
2. `epsilon` is defined and used to avoid taking the log of 0.
3. The order of input parameters for the `ctc.ctc_loss` function is fixed.

These corrections address the issues that were causing the function to produce index out of range errors.
