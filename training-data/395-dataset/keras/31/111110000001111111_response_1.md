Potential Error Location:
The error is most likely caused by the line `y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())`. The usage of `epsilon()` without proper definition and the transpose operation can lead to an index out of bounds error, especially when the batch size is 1.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The use of `epsilon()` without proper definition can cause unexpected behavior in the addition operation. Additionally, the transpose operation might result in index out of bounds error when the batch size is 1.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define `epsilon` as a small value (e.g., 1e-8) before using it in the addition operation.
2. Add a condition to handle the special case when the batch size is 1 to avoid the transpose operation and potential index out of bounds error.

Corrected Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(tf.to_int32(label_length))
    input_length = tf.squeeze(tf.to_int32(input_length))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(tf.contrib.layers.dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    if tf.shape(y_pred)[0] == 1:
        y_pred = tf.reduce_sum(y_pred, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    else:
        y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + 1e-8)
