The potential error in the code is that the function `ctc_batch_cost` is trying to use undefined functions such as `tf.to_int32`, `tf.squeeze`, `tf.transpose`, and `epsilon()` without importing the necessary TensorFlow library or defining these functions within the code.

The bug occurred because the necessary TensorFlow library functions were not imported, and the function `epsilon()` was used without being defined.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the necessary TensorFlow library at the beginning of the file.
2. Define the function `epsilon()` if it's a custom function required for the calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def epsilon():
    # Define the epsilon function if it's a custom function
    pass

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```

In this corrected code, I assumed the `epsilon()` function is a custom function. If it's a built-in TensorFlow function, then no need to define it. I also used `tf.math.log` and `tf.nn.ctc_loss` as they are the correct methods from the TensorFlow library.
