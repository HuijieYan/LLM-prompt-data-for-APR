The error message indicates that the problem occurs in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function located in the `keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py` file. The error message specifically points to the creation of a `TensorShape` and the attempt to access an index that is out of range.

The potential error location within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function could be related to the way it handles the shape of the input tensors, especially when the batch size is 1. It seems that the indexing error occurs when trying to access the first dimension of a tensor with shape `[]` (empty shape).

The potential reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be:
1. The function does not handle the case when the batch size is 1 properly, leading to index out of range errors when accessing dimensions.
2. There might be an issue with how the shape of the input tensors is inferred or handled within the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the presence of conditional statements that handle edge cases, such as when the batch size is 1, and adjust the logic accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function properly handles the shape of the input tensors, especially in scenarios with a batch size of 1.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.backend import ctc
from keras.backend import epsilon

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.cast(tf.squeeze(label_length), tf.int32)
    input_length = tf.cast(tf.squeeze(input_length), tf.int32)
    sparse_labels = tf.cast(ctc.ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length), tf.int32)

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                      inputs=y_pred,
                                      sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```

In the corrected function, the `tf.to_int32` is replaced with `tf.cast` for casting the tensors to int32, and the order of arguments in the `ctc.ctc_loss` function is adjusted to match the correct order. Additionally, it ensures that the tensors are properly cast and squeezed to handle edge cases such as when the batch size is 1.
