The error message "get slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds error when using online training (batch_size=1)" suggests that there might be an issue with indexing in the `ctc_batch_cost` function when using a batch size of 1.

Looking at the code, the potential error location is likely in the line `tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred, labels=sparse_labels, sequence_length=input_length), 1)` where `input_length` is being used as a sequence length parameter for the CTC loss function. When the batch size is 1, it's possible that there is an indexing error here causing the out of bounds error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the use of `input_length` and `label_length` tensors with a batch size of 1. The code does not handle the scenario of a batch size of 1 properly, leading to the out of bounds error.

To fix the bug, the code should include a check for the batch size and handle the scenario of a batch size of 1 differently. Additionally, the indexing operations should be reviewed to ensure they are safe for the given input shapes.

Below is the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """

    if input_length.shape[0] == 1:
        # Handle the case of batch size = 1
        input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length)
        label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length)
    else:
        # Handle batch size > 1
        input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1)
        label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1)

    sparse_labels = tf.cast(tf.contrib.layers.dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length), tf.int32)

    y_pred = tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2])
    input_length = tf.cast(input_length, tf.int32)

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                        inputs=y_pred,
                                        sequence_length=input_length,
                                        time_major=True), axis=1)
```

In the corrected code, a check has been added to handle the case of input length with a batch size of 1 differently. Additionally, the sparse labels are cast to `tf.int32` and the `ctc_loss` function is used from `tf.nn` module. This should address the indexing and out of bounds error when using a batch size of 1.
