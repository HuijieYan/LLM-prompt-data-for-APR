The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))`, specifically with the `label_length` argument.

The error message indicates an IndexError with `list index out of range` in the `__getitem__` method of `TensorShape` class. This suggests that the issue is related to indexing a dimension of a tensor, and the error occurs when trying to access an index that is out of bounds.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to a mismatch in the shape or size of the `label_length` tensor. It seems that the `label_length` tensor is not in the expected format, leading to an index out of range error when accessing its dimensions.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `label_length` tensor is in the correct shape and size. Additionally, we should handle the case of `batch_size = 1` appropriately to avoid index out of range errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length)
    sparse_labels = ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + 1e-8)

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                        logits=y_pred,
                                        label_length=label_length,
                                        logit_length=input_length,
                                        logits_time_major=True), 1)
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the unnecessary type conversion (`tf.to_int32()`) for `label_length` and `input_length`, and used `tf.squeeze()` to remove unnecessary dimensions. We have also used `tf.nn.ctc_loss` instead of `ctc.ctc_loss` for calculating the CTC loss.

This corrected code should handle the case of `batch_size = 1` and avoid the index out of range errors.
