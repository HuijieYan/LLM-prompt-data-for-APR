The error message points to an `IndexError` in the function `tensorflow_backend.py` specifically in the line:

```python
return self._dims[key]
```

It seems that the error is related to the indexing of a dimension in a TensorShape object.

The bug is likely occurring because the code tries to access a dimension using an invalid index. This could be due to incorrect manipulation of the dimensions in the TensorShape object.

To fix this bug, the following approach can be taken:
- Ensure that the dimensions of the TensorShape object are properly manipulated and accessed.
- Check if the indexing for dimensions is within the valid range before accessing the dimension.
- Validate the input data and the operations performed on the TensorShape object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Relative function's signature in this file
def ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(labels, label_lengths):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# This is the corrected function
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.

    import tensorflow as tf
    
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1)
    sparse_labels = ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    epsilon = tf.convert_to_tensor(1e-8, y_pred.dtype.base_dtype, name='epsilon')
    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon)

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels, logits=y_pred, label_length=label_length, logits_length=input_length, blank_index=-1), 1)
