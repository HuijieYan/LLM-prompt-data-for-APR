The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 3947 in the "ctc_batch_cost" function of the "keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py" file. The issue may be caused by the index being out of range, possibly due to incorrect dimensions or slicing of the tensor shape.

The error likely occurs when trying to retrieve a dimension from the tensor shape using an index. This suggests that the indexing operation is going out of range, leading to the "IndexError."

One approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the dimensions of the tensor shape are correctly handled when performing the indexing operation.

Here's the corrected code for the "ctc_batch_cost" function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras import backend as K
from keras.backend.tensorflow_backend import ctc_label_dense_to_sparse

epsilon = K.epsilon  # Get the epsilon value from K (assuming it is defined in the backend)

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.squeeze(tf.to_int32(label_length))
    input_length = tf.squeeze(tf.to_int32(input_length))
    sparse_labels = ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    y_pred = tf.keras.backend.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon)

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(sparse_labels, y_pred, input_length, time_major=False), 1)
```

In the corrected code:
- The usage of "ctc_label_dense_to_sparse" directly instead of wrapping it with tf.to_int32 is done, as it is already specified to return int32 by the function signature.
- The epsilon value is obtained from the Keras backend using "K.epsilon" instead of calling it as a function.
- The ctc_loss function is called using tf.nn.ctc_loss instead of ctc.ctc_loss, which could potentially resolve any indexing issues.
