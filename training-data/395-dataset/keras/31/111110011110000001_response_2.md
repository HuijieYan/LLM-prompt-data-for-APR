The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" in the function `__getitem__` of the `TensorShape` class in TensorFlow. This indicates that the code is trying to access an index that is out of range in a list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))`. This is where the error occurs, and it seems that the issue is related to the `label_length` not having the expected shape or length.

The bug occurred because the `label_length` variable may not have been in the expected shape when used in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. The `label_length` was probably expected to be a 1D array or tensor, but it might have been provided in a different shape or size, resulting in the index error when trying to access its elements.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `label_length` variable is correctly shaped as a 1D array or tensor before passing it to the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. This can be achieved by using numpy's `ravel()` function to convert the label_length to a 1D array.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    label_length = np.ravel(label_length)  # Ensure label_length is a 1D array
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```
