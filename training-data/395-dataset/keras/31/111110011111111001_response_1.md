The error is likely occurring in the `ctc_batch_cost` function, specifically within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` call. The error message indicates an issue with indexing a list, which could mean that the shape of the input tensor is not as expected.

The `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function expects `y_true` and `label_length` as inputs. Looking at the function signature, it appears that `label_length` is being used as a tensor of shape `(samples, 1)` and the error message indicates that an index of the shape is being accessed. This indicates that `label_length` is not a scalar value but a tensor, creating the indexing error when trying to access its dimensions.

To fix this, we can modify the way `label_length` is used. The `label_length` tensor should be used directly without squeezing its dimensions. The `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function will handle the necessary transformations.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(tf.contrib.layers.dense_to_sparse(y_true, tf.to_int32(label_length)))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                        inputs=y_pred,
                                        sequence_length=input_length,
                                        ctc_merge_repeated=True), 1)
```

In the corrected function, `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` has been replaced with `tf.contrib.layers.dense_to_sparse` to convert the dense labels to a SparseTensor directly. The `ctc_loss` function has also been modified to use `tf.nn.ctc_loss` as the loss function.
