The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError" occurring in the `tensor_shape.py` file at line 788. This implies that there is an attempt to access an index that is out of range, which suggests that there might be an issue with the dimensions or indexing within the function.

The potential error location within the `ctc_batch_cost` function is in the line:
```python
sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))
```
The error seems to be related to the `label_length` variable.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug might be improper handling of the dimensions of `label_length`, leading to an out of range index access.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the dimensions of `label_length` are handled correctly when they are being used for indexing or processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops.ctc_ops import ctc_label_dense_to_sparse
from tensorflow.contrib.ctc import ctc_loss

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1)
    sparse_labels = ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                   labels=sparse_labels,
                                   sequence_length=input_length), axis=1)
```

In the corrected code, the `tf.to_int32` function is replaced with `tf.squeeze` to handle the dimensions of `label_length` and `input_length` correctly. Additionally, the `epsilon` function is replaced with `tf.keras.backend.epsilon()` for consistency and to ensure compatibility with the Keras backend.
