The error message indicates an "IndexError" related to the dimensions of the tensors being used in the function `ctc_batch_cost` from `keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py`.

The bug is likely to be related to the tensor dimensions within the function, possibly from the `label_length` variable where there might be an issue with the tensor shape and indexing.

The error occurs because the function is trying to access an index that is out of range for the tensor dimension. This could be due to incorrect reshaping or manipulation of tensor dimensions.

To fix this bug, the tensor reshaping or dimension manipulation needs to be reviewed to ensure that all tensor operations have compatible shapes.
Additionally, the tensor dimensions should be checked and validated to avoid index out of range errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1)
    sparse_labels = tf.cast(tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true), tf.int32)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + K.epsilon())

    loss = tf.compat.v1.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                   inputs=y_pred,
                                   sequence_length=input_length,
                                   preprocess_collapse_repeated=False,
                                   ctc_merge_repeated=True,
                                   time_major=True)
    
    loss = tf.expand_dims(loss, axis=1)
    return loss
```
In the corrected code:
- We use `tf.squeeze` to remove dimensions of size 1 from the shape of a tensor.
- We cast the `sparse_labels` to `tf.int32` explicitly.
- We use `tf.compat.v1.nn.ctc_loss` for the CTC loss calculation, providing necessary arguments like `preprocess_collapse_repeated` and `ctc_merge_repeated`.
- Finally, we expand the dimensions of the loss tensor before returning it.
