The error message indicates that the issue arises from the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function within the `ctc_batch_cost` function. It seems to be related to the dimensions of the input data.

The likely reason for the bug is that the shape of the input data is not being handled properly within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. It is failing to retrieve the correct dimensions from the input data, leading to an IndexError.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the shape of the input data is properly handled and that the correct dimensions are retrieved.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples,)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples,)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples, 1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length)
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon)

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(sparse_labels, y_pred, input_length, label_length, logits_time_major=True), axis=1)
```

In the corrected code:
- The shape of the input data is handled correctly using `tf.squeeze` to remove dimensions of size 1, and `tf.sparse.from_dense` to convert the dense `y_true` tensor to a sparse tensor.
- The `log` operation is replaced with `tf.math.log` to take the logarithm element-wise.
- The `ctc_loss` function from TensorFlow's NN module is used to calculate the CTC loss directly. The input arguments are `sparse_labels, y_pred, input_length, label_length`.

These changes should address the issues related to the incorrect handling of input data dimensions and should resolve the bug that caused the IndexError.
