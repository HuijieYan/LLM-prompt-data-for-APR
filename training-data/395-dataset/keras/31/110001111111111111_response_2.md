Based on the error message, the issue seems to be occurring in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function, specifically when trying to access dimension 0 of the input tensor `elems_flat[0].shape`. This is likely due to incorrect indexing or handling of the input tensor's shape.

One possible reason for this error could be that the `label_length` tensor is not being correctly squeezed to remove the unnecessary dimensions. This could lead to issues when trying to access specific dimensions in the subsequent operations.

To fix this bug, the `label_length` tensor should be properly squeezed before being used in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. This would ensure that the shape of the tensor is compatible with the subsequent operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    import tensorflow as tf  # Assuming the required packages are imported here
    from tensorflow.python.ops import ctc_ops as ctc

    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=-1)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=-1)
    sparse_labels = ctc.ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```

By correctly applying the `tf.squeeze` method to `label_length` and `input_length`, we ensure that unnecessary dimensions are removed, and the subsequent operations involving these tensors will be in accordance with the expected shapes.
