The error message indicates that the issue is with accessing the dimension of a tensor. It seems that the error occurs when the function `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` is being called within the `ctc_batch_cost` function. This is potentially causing the function to try to access a dimension that is out of bounds.

The error occurs due to the way the dimensions of the tensor are being accessed within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the dimensions of the tensor are correctly accessed within the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length, epsilon=1e-8):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.
        epsilon: (optional) small value to avoid numerical instability when taking the logarithm

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true)
    input_length = tf.expand_dims(input_length, 1)
    label_length = tf.expand_dims(label_length, 1)

    return tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                          logits=y_pred,
                          label_length=label_length,
                          logit_length=input_length,
                          logits_time_major=False,
                          unique=None)
```

In the corrected code, the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function has been replaced with TensorFlow's built-in `tf.sparse.from_dense` function to create sparse labels. Additionally, the parameters are directly used in the `tf.nn.ctc_loss` function to calculate the CTC loss. These changes should address the issue and provide a solution for the bug.
