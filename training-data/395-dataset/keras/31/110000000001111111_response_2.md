The error is likely occurring in the line `sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))` because the `label_length` tensor has the wrong shape. The shape of `label_length` should be `(2,)` based on the expected variable value and type, but it is currently `(2, 1)`.

The bug is occurring because the `label_length` tensor is being squeezed to remove the extra dimension. However, the `tf.squeeze(label_length)` operation does not modify the original tensor in-place, so it continues to have the original shape `(2, 1)`.

To fix the bug, the `label_length` tensor should be squeezed correctly to have the shape `(2,)` before being used in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops import ctc_ops as ctc

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1)
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + tf.constant(1e-8))

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                       logits=y_pred,
                                       label_length=label_length,
                                       logit_length=input_length,
                                       blank_index=-1), 1)
```

In the corrected function, the `label_length` and `input_length` tensors are squeezed using `tf.squeeze` to remove the extra dimension. The `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function is replaced with `tf.sparse.from_dense` to create a SparseTensor directly from the dense tensor `y_true`. The `ctc_loss` function is also updated to use the correct parameters based on the TensorFlow documentation. Additionally, the `epsilon()` function is replaced with `tf.constant(1e-8)` for numerical stability in the logarithm operation.
