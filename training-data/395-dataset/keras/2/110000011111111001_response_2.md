The error message indicates that the `in_top_k` function is not found in the `keras.backend.numpy_backend` module, which is causing an `AttributeError`. This error is preventing the test function from running successfully.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `in_top_k` function, which is not available in the `keras.backend.numpy_backend` module.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `in_top_k` function is not implemented or available in the `keras.backend.numpy_backend` module.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to check the documentation or source code of the `keras.backend.numpy_backend` module to see if there is an alternative function that can be used in place of `in_top_k`. If no alternative function is available, consider modifying the test function to use a different backend that provides the required functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit as sigmoid

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
