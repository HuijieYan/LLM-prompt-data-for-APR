The error message is indicating that the `keras.backend.numpy_backend` module has no attribute `in_top_k`, which is being called in the test function.

The bug is occurring because the `in_top_k` method is not implemented in the `numpy_backend` module. This method seems to be related to CNTK backend, which is not compatible with the `numpy_backend` module.

To fix this bug, we need to implement the `in_top_k` method in the appropriate backend module (e.g., CNTK backend) where it is missing. Additionally, the test function needs to be modified to use the correct backend or handle the absence of the `in_top_k` method in the `numpy_backend` module.

Here's a corrected `binary_crossentropy` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.backend as K

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = K.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = K.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -K.log(K.sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -K.log(1 - K.sigmoid(output)))
```

The test function should also be modified to use the correct backend or handle the absence of the `in_top_k` method in the `numpy_backend` module.
