The error message shows that the 'numpy_backend' module from 'keras.backend' does not have an attribute called 'in_top_k', which is being used in the test case.

The actual problematic function in the given code is the 'binary_crossentropy' function. This function calculates the binary cross-entropy between the target and the output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'in_top_k' function is not available in the 'numpy_backend' module of Keras, which causes the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the 'in_top_k' function needs to be replaced with a similar function that is available in the 'numpy_backend' module of Keras.

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
```

In the corrected code, I have added the 'sigmoid' function to calculate the sigmoid of the output. The 'np' prefix is used to refer to numpy functions, which is an essential part of making this code work correctly.
