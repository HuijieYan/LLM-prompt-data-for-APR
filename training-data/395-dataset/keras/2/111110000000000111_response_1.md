The error is likely in the `binary_crossentropy` function, specifically in the usage of the `sigmoid` function, which is not defined in the provided code. 

The error message in the GitHub issue is related to a problem with the `K.in_top_k` function in the CNTK backend. However, this issue is unrelated to the provided code.

To fix the `binary_crossentropy` function, you can use the `K.sigmoid` function provided by the Keras backend instead of an undefined `sigmoid` function. Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.backend as K

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
        
    return (target * -K.log(K.sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -K.log(1 - K.sigmoid(output)))
```

This corrected function makes use of the `K.log` and `K.sigmoid` functions from the Keras backend to perform the necessary computations accurately.
