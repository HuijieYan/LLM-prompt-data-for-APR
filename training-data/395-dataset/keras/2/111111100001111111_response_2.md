Based on the error message provided, it seems that the issue is related to the `binary_crossentropy` function and its usage of the `sigmoid` function, which is not properly implemented. The error message suggests a problem with the expected input format, which could be caused by the incorrect usage or implementation of the `sigmoid` function.

The `sigmoid` function is most likely implemented in the `numpy_backend` module, and the `binary_crossentropy` function is trying to use it for calculating the binary cross-entropy. However, the implementation of the `sigmoid` function seems to be missing and causing the error.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to make sure that the `sigmoid` function is properly implemented in the `numpy_backend.py` module.
2. We need to replace the usage of `np.log(sigmoid(output))` with `np.log(output)` in the `binary_crossentropy` function, as the `sigmoid` function should handle the conversion internally.

Here's the corrected code for the `binary_crossentropy` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```

With these changes, the `sigmoid` function is properly implemented, and the `binary_crossentropy` function uses the `sigmoid` function consistently for calculating the binary cross-entropy. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
