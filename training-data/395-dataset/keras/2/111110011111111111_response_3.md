Upon analyzing the error message from the test function, it appears that the issue lies in the `in_top_k` function call for the CNTK backend. The AttributeError is raised because the keras.backend.numpy_backend module does not have the 'in_top_k' attribute.

The potential error location is within the test case where the `in_top_k` function is called for the CNTK backend.

The buggy function does not directly relate to the error message from the test function, but the fix for the buggy function can potentially resolve issues related to the `in_top_k` function call for the CNTK backend.

The reason behind the bug is that the `in_top_k` function is not properly handled or available for the CNTK backend, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the binary_crossentropy function can be updated to handle the CNTK backend effectively. Additionally, the `in_top_k` function for the CNTK backend needs to be addressed separately.

The corrected code for the problematic function `binary_crossentropy` is provided below:

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
```

This corrected code includes the addition of the `sigmoid` function, which is used in the binary_crossentropy function.

For the `in_top_k` issue with the CNTK backend, it would require a separate fix within the Keras implementation to handle the behavior of `in_top_k` for the CNTK backend.
