The issue seems to be occurring within the `binary_crossentropy` function in the provided code. The error message mentions issues with the classification error and the expected MBLayout.

The bug in the `binary_crossentropy` function may be causing the incorrect evaluation of the classification error. This could be due to incorrect calculations within the function, leading to unexpected behavior when evaluating the in_top_k function on a CNTK backend.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculations within the `binary_crossentropy` function are correct and do not lead to unexpected outputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `binary_crossentropy` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def clip(x, min_value, max_value):
    return np.clip(x, min_value, max_value)

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```

This corrected code should address the issues in the original function and prevent unexpected behavior when using the CNTK backend.
