The error message indicates that the module 'keras.backend.numpy_backend' does not have an attribute 'in_top_k', which is being called in the test function. However, the provided code is related to the binary cross-entropy function and does not directly involve 'in_top_k'.

Upon reviewing the function 'binary_crossentropy', it seems that the issue might be related to the use of the 'np' namespace without importing the numpy library. Additionally, the 'sigmoid' function is not implemented within the provided code, which might cause further issues.

To fix the bug in the 'binary_crossentropy' function and modify it according to the used libraries, we need to:
1. Import the numpy library in the numpy_backend file.
2. Implement the sigmoid function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'binary_crossentropy' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))

    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
