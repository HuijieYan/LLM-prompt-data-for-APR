Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the use of the `in_top_k` function from the CNTK backend, which is throwing a runtime error.

Reason behind the bug: It appears that the `binary_crossentropy` function is not correctly handling the calculation of the `output` variable, which is causing issues when used with the CNTK backend.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Rewrite the `binary_crossentropy` function to correctly handle the calculation of the `output` variable.
2. Ensure that the function is compatible with the CNTK backend by testing it with the specific backend.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))

# The corrected function includes the correct implementation of the sigmoid function and the formula for binary crossentropy.
```
