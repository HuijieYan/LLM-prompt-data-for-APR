Potential error location: 
The issue is with the `sigmoid` function call within the `binary_crossentropy` function. The `sigmoid` function is not properly defined or implemented, which is causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `sigmoid` function is being called, but it is not defined in the provided code snippet. This is causing a NameError when the `sigmoid` function is called within the `binary_crossentropy` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `sigmoid` function within the same file or import it from another module if it already exists elsewhere.
2. Ensure that the `sigmoid` function is implemented correctly to return the sigmoid of the input.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
