Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the K.in_top_k function in the CNTK backend, but the provided code doesn't directly seem to be related to that issue.

Reason for the bug: The bug might be occurring due to the usage of unsupported operations or incorrect inputs in the K.in_top_k function in the CNTK backend. However, the provided code for the binary_crossentropy function does not seem to be directly related to the error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The bug seems to be related to the usage of the K.in_top_k function in the CNTK backend, so the fix would involve investigating the input data and operations used in the K.in_top_k function to determine the cause of the error. Additionally, it might be necessary to check for compatibility issues between Keras, CNTK, and the Python environment being used.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(1/(1 + np.exp(-output))) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - 1/(1 + np.exp(-output))))
```
In the corrected code, the sigmoid function has been replaced with the numpy implementation of the sigmoid function. Additionally, the log function usage has been modified to be consistent with the sigmoid function replacement.
