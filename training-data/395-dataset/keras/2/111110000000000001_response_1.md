Potential Error Location: The potential error in the code is with the sigmoid function, which is not defined within the provided code.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the code references a `sigmoid` function that is not defined in the provided code, causing a NameError.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to define the `sigmoid` function or use an existing implementation of the sigmoid function from a library such as NumPy.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
