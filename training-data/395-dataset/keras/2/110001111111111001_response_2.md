The error message is stating that the module 'keras.backend.numpy_backend' has no attribute 'in_top_k'. This means that the 'in_top_k' function is missing from the 'numpy_backend.py' file.

Upon inspecting the provided code, it is clear that the 'in_top_k' function is not present in the given code. This function is being invoked in the test case, causing the test to fail.

To fix this issue, the 'in_top_k' function needs to be implemented in the 'numpy_backend.py' file. Additionally, it seems like the test case and the given function 'binary_crossentropy' are from different modules and are not directly related to the issue described in the error message.

Corrected 'binary_crossentropy' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) + (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```

This corrected function includes the implementation of the sigmoid function and the binary cross-entropy calculation using NumPy operations.
