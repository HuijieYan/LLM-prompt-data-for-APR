The potential error in the provided code is that the `sigmoid` function is not defined within the `numpy_backend.py` file. This is likely the cause of the bug as the `binary_crossentropy` function calls the `sigmoid` function, but it is not implemented.

To fix this bug, the `sigmoid` function needs to be implemented within the `numpy_backend.py` file and then called within the `binary_crossentropy` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `binary_crossentropy` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_2/keras/backend/numpy_backend.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# relative function's signature in this file
def clip(x, min_value, max_value):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```

In the corrected code, the `sigmoid` function has been defined and implemented using numpy methods. This should fix the bug in the `binary_crossentropy` function.
