Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the given code is the use of the `sigmoid` function without importing it or defining it. This will result in a NameError as the `sigmoid` function is not recognized.

Reason behind the Bug:
The bug occurred because the `sigmoid` function is being called, but it is neither defined within the code nor imported from any module. This results in a NameError when the `binary_crossentropy` function is called.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the `sigmoid` function from a module where it is defined.
2. Define the `sigmoid` function within the same file.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
