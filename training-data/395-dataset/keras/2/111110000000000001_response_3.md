Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the code is with the 'sigmoid' function being used without being defined or imported. 

Reason for the Bug:
The 'sigmoid' function is being used without being defined in the given code. It seems that the intention is to use the sigmoid function to transform the output, but it is not defined in the code. 

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to define or import the sigmoid function and use it to transform the output before calculating the binary crossentropy.

```python
# Corrected function
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
