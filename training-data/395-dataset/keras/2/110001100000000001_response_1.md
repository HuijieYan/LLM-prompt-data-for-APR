Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the calculation of the binary cross-entropy loss. The current implementation is using the `sigmoid` function, which is not defined in the code. Additionally, the `output` is being clipped and transformed using the `np.log` function without importing the numpy library.

Reason for the bug:
The `sigmoid` function is not defined in the given code, and the numpy library is not imported to use the `np.clip` and `np.log` functions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the numpy library at the beginning of the file to use the `np.clip` and `np.log` functions.
2. Define the `sigmoid` function using the numpy library's `exp` function to avoid division by zero and overflow issues.

Corrected code:

```python
# import numpy library
import numpy as np

# Define the sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Define the binary cross-entropy function
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
