Potential error location: Within the `binary_crossentropy` function.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the use of the `sigmoid` function. The `sigmoid` function is likely not implemented correctly or is not being called with the correct input in the `binary_crossentropy` function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Use the correct implementation of the `sigmoid` function.
- Ensure that the input to the `sigmoid` function is within the valid range.
- Check for any potential issues related to the backend being used.

Corrected code for the `binary_crossentropy` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
