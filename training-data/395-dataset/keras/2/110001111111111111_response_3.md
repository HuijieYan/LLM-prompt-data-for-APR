The error message indicates that the 'in_top_k' function is not found in the 'keras.backend.numpy_backend' module, leading to an AttributeError. This is likely because the 'numpy_backend' module does not have the 'in_top_k' function defined.

To resolve this issue:
1. It appears that the 'binary_crossentropy' function is not directly related to the test case and is not the cause of the specific error message described. However, fixing that function could prevent potential future errors.
2. The 'binary_crossentropy' function is faulty and needs correction.

Here's the correct code for the 'binary_crossentropy' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def clip(x, min_value, max_value):
    return np.clip(x, min_value, max_value)

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    eps = 1e-7

    if not from_logits:
        output = clip(output, eps, 1 - eps)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))

    return target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) + (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output))
```

This corrected code defines a sigmoid function and uses it within the binary_crossentropy function. Additionally, it removes the undefined 'np' references and properly applies the 'clip' function with the correct variable names and parameters.
