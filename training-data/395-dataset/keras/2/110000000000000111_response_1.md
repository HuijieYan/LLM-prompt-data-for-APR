The issue seems to be with the K.in_top_k function when using the CNTK backend. However, the provided function "binary_crossentropy" seems to be unrelated to the issue described.

For the given function "binary_crossentropy", the issue seems to be with the usage of the "sigmoid" function, which is not defined in the provided code. 

To fix this issue, we can define the sigmoid function and then use it in the binary_crossentropy function.

Here's the corrected code for the binary_crossentropy function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```

In the corrected code, we have defined the sigmoid function and used it within the binary_crossentropy function. This should resolve the issue related to the usage of the "sigmoid" function.
