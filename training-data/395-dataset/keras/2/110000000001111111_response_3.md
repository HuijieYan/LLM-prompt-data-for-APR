Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the 'binary_crossentropy' function because of the use of 'np.log' and 'sigmoid' functions, which may not be compatible with the backend being used (CNTK).

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error message suggests that the CNTK backend is expecting a certain input format ('MBLayout') which is not being provided correctly. This is likely due to the use of numpy functions within the 'binary_crossentropy' function, which may not be compatible with the CNTK backend.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace the numpy functions with their corresponding backend functions from Keras to ensure compatibility with the CNTK backend.
2. Use Keras backend functions for mathematical operations instead of relying on external libraries like numpy.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import keras.backend as K

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = K.clip(output, K.epsilon(), 1 - K.epsilon())
        output = K.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -K.log_sigmoid(output) +
            (1 - target) * -K.log(1 - K.sigmoid(output)))
```

By using the Keras backend functions instead of numpy, we ensure that the binary_crossentropy function is compatible with the CNTK backend and should not produce the error reported in the GitHub issue.
