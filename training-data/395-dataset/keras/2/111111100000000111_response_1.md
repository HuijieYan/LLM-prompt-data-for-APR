The error message indicates that the function `binary_crossentropy` is causing an issue when using the CNTK backend. The error message specifically mentions the `ClassificationError` and the expected input format, which suggests that the issue is related to the format of the input data.

Upon analyzing the buggy function `binary_crossentropy`, it appears that there might be an issue with the use of the `np.log` and `np.clip` functions, which are not defined within the function or imported from numpy.

The reason behind the bug is that the function references `np.log` and `np.clip` without importing numpy or defining these functions within the scope of the function. This leads to an error when the function is called, as the referenced functions are not found.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `numpy` library within the scope of the `numpy_backend` file and use the `np.log` and `np.clip` functions with the correct syntax.

Here is the corrected code for the `binary_crossentropy` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# relative function's signature in this file
def sigmoid(x):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def clip(x, min_value, max_value):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```

By correcting the function and importing `numpy` within the scope of the file, the issue with the undefined `np.log` and `np.clip` functions should be resolved.
