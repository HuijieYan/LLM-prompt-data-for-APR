The error occurs in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class. The issue is with the call to `self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)`. The `compute_gradients` method of the optimizer class only takes two positional arguments, but three were provided. This is consistent with the error message received from the test function.

The reason for this bug is that the `compute_gradients` method in the `MyTfOptimizer` class is not designed to accept the `params` argument directly. However, the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class is passing `params` to `compute_gradients`, resulting in the error.

To fix this bug, the `params` argument needs to be removed from the call to `compute_gradients`. It seems that `params` is not used in the `compute_gradients` method of `MyTfOptimizer`, so it should be safe to remove it. 

Additionally, once the gradients are computed, there are unnecessary operations to update the iterations and apply the gradients. These operations can be simplified.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_apply = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads)
    self.updates.append(opt_apply)
    return self.updates
```
