The error message indicates that the function `compute_gradients()` is receiving one extra argument than expected. This means that the `self.optimizer.compute_gradients()` call inside the `get_updates` method is passing the `params` list as an additional argument when it should be unpacked and passed as separate arguments.

The bug occurs because the `self.optimizer.compute_gradients()` call is not unpacking the `params` list and is passing it as a single argument along with `loss`. Since `compute_gradients()` is defined with variable keyword arguments (`**kwargs`), it expects named parameters rather than a list. 

To fix this bug, the `params` list should be unpacked and passed as separate arguments to `compute_gradients()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, var_list=params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In the corrected code:
- The `var_list` argument is being used to pass the list of parameters to `compute_gradients()` instead of passing it directly as a positional argument. This ensures that each item in the `params` list is unpacked correctly.
- The `compute_gradients()` method now receives the `loss` and `var_list` as the expected two positional arguments.
