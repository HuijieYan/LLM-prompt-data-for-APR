The error message `TypeError: compute_gradients() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given` indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is being called with 3 arguments, but it is defined to only accept 2 arguments.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class. Specifically, the line `grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)` is where the error is occurring.

The bug occurred because the `compute_gradients` method of the optimizer was called with 3 arguments (loss and params) while it was defined to only accept 2 arguments.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `compute_gradients` call to only pass the `loss` argument, assuming that the `params` are already accessible within the optimizer object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class TFOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """
    Wrapper class for native TensorFlow optimizers.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    @interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
            grads, global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```

With this correction, the `compute_gradients` method is only called with the `loss` argument, as it was originally intended.
