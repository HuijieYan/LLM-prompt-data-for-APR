Potential Error Location: 
The error is occurring in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class in the `keras.optimizers` module. The `compute_gradients` method is being called with three positional arguments, but it is defined to take only two arguments.

Reason for the Bug: 
The `compute_gradients` method within the `MyTfOptimizer` class is being called with `loss` and `params` as arguments, indicating that it expects two arguments. However, the definition of `compute_gradients` within the `MyTfOptimizer` class only allows for one positional argument, which causes the TypeError when it receives three arguments.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Modify the `compute_gradients` method within the `MyTfOptimizer` class to accept a variable number of positional arguments, including `loss` and `params`.
2. Alternatively, refactor the `get_updates` method within the `TFOptimizer` class to only pass the required arguments to the `compute_gradients` method.
3. Ensure that the `compute_gradients` method within the `MyTfOptimizer` class conforms to the interface expected by the `TFOptimizer` class.

Corrected Code:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, var_list=params)  # Adjust the call to pass the correct number of arguments
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
