The potential error in the function is the way the updates are being constructed. The code is trying to manually create the list of updates by appending the optimizer operation to the list of updates. However, it seems like it's unnecessary to manually handle the updates in this way and it's prone to errors.

The bug occurred because the code is not correctly handling the updates. Instead of manually creating the list of updates, the code should use the `get_updates` method from the base class `Optimizer` or utilize TensorFlow's `minimize` method.

To fix the bug, the `get_updates` method should be modified to utilize TensorFlow's `minimize` method, which automatically handles the updates.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    return self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)
```

By using `self.optimizer.apply_gradients` directly, we can simplify the code and ensure that the updates are correctly handled by the optimizer.
