The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method of the optimizer is being called with 3 arguments, while it only takes 2 positional arguments.

1. The test case is attempting to create and compile a model using a custom TensorFlow optimizer passed through Keras' `TFOptimizer`. The error occurs during the optimization process.

2. The potential error location is the `compute_gradients` method of the optimizer used in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer`.

3. The bug occurred because the `compute_gradients` method is being called with an additional `params` argument, which is not expected by the method.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `compute_gradients` method of the custom TensorFlow optimizer to only accept the `loss` argument.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer`:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
