The potential error in the code is with the use of the `self.optimizer` attribute. It seems that `self.optimizer` is not defined within the scope of the function, which is causing the bug.

The reason behind the bug is that the `self.optimizer` attribute is expected to be defined within the class that contains the `get_updates` function. However, it is likely that `self.optimizer` is not initialized properly or is not accessible within the function.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to ensure that the `self.optimizer` attribute is properly initialized and accessible within the class that contains the `get_updates` function. This may involve initializing `self.optimizer` in the constructor of the class or passing it as a parameter to the function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params, optimizer):
    grads = optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    updates.append(opt_update)
    return updates
```

In this corrected code, the `self.optimizer` attribute has been replaced with the `optimizer` parameter, which is passed to the function. This ensures that the optimizer is explicitly provided to the function and avoids any issues with scope or initialization.
