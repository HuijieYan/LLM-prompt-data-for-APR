The potential error in the buggy function is that the 'get_updates' method of the 'TFOptimizer' class is not returning the correct updates. The updates should include incrementing the iterations and applying the gradients to the optimizer. However, the method is not constructing the updates list properly.

The bug occurs because the updates are not being constructed correctly. The method should append the operation for incrementing the iterations separately and then append the operation for applying the gradients using the 'self.optimizer.apply_gradients' method. However, the current code combines both operations into a single list, leading to incorrect updates.

To fix the bug, the method should first update the iterations by adding 1 to 'self.iterations' using 'K.update_add' and then apply the gradients to the optimizer using 'self.optimizer.apply_gradients'. The two operations should be appended separately to the 'self.updates' list.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_updates' method:

```python
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
