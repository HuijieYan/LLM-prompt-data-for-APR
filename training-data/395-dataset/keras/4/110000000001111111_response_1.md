The potential error in the provided function is that it is using a deprecated method `legacy_get_updates_support` to decorate the function. This method is no longer supported in the current version of Keras, which could lead to errors.

Another issue is that `compute_gradients` and `apply_gradients` methods might not be called correctly on `self.optimizer`. The provided class `MyTfOptimizer` needs to be verified to ensure it correctly implements the necessary methods for computing and applying gradients.

To fix these issues, the following steps can be taken:
1. Remove the `@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support` decorator as it is no longer supported.
2. Verify that the custom optimizer class `MyTfOptimizer` correctly implements the necessary methods for computing and applying gradients.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, params)
    self.updates = [self.iterations.assign_add(1)]
    self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, params), self.iterations)
    return self.updates
```
