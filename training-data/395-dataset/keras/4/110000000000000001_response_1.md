Potential error: It seems that the function is trying to use the 'self' variable as if it belongs to a class, but it is not defined in the given function.

Reason behind the bug: The function is using the 'self' variable, which indicates that it is meant to be a method within a class. However, it is missing the class definition, so 'self' is not properly initialized.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to define the class and properly initialize the 'self' variable before using it within the function.

Corrected code:

```python
class ClassName:
    @interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
            grads, global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```
In this corrected code, I have defined a class called 'ClassName' and placed the given function within it, allowing the use of the 'self' variable.
