Potential error location: The issue may be with the `self.optimizer.compute_gradients` and `self.optimizer.apply_gradients` methods, as they are not standard TensorFlow optimizer methods.

Reasons behind the bug: The `compute_gradients` and `apply_gradients` methods are not standard methods of the optimizer class in TensorFlow. This code is attempting to use these methods as if they are part of the optimizer class, but in reality, they are specific to certain subclasses of optimizers such as `tf.train.Optimizer`.

Possible approaches to fix the bug: Replace `self.optimizer.compute_gradients` and `self.optimizer.apply_gradients` with the standard TensorFlow optimizer methods for computing and applying gradients.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
