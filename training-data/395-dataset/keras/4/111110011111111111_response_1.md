The error occurs when the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class is called with three arguments, but it is defined to only accept two positional arguments.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class is calling the `compute_gradients` method with `loss` and `params` as arguments, but this method should only take `loss` as an argument when calling the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class.

To fix this bug, the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class should call the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class with only the `loss` argument and not `params`. The corrected code for the `get_updates` method is as follows:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
