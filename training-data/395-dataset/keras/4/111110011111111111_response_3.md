The error occurs in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class. The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is receiving 3 positional arguments instead of the expected 2.

The bug occurs because the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class is defined to take `loss` and `**kwargs` as its parameters, but the `get_updates` method is passing `loss` and `params`. This mismatch in parameter names and types is causing the error.

To fix the bug, the `compute_gradients` method should be modified to accept `loss` and `params` as its arguments, similar to the way they are being passed in the `get_updates` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
class TFOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """
    Wrapper class for native TensorFlow optimizers.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    @interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
            grads_and_vars, global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```

With this correction, the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class will receive `loss` and `params` as its arguments, resolving the error.
