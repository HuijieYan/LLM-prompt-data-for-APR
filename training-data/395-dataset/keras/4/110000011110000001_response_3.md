The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` in the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class, specifically stating that it takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given. This error occurs because the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class only expects the `loss` argument, but the `get_updates` method is passing `loss` and `params` to it.

To fix this bug, you should update the `compute_gradients` method to accept the additional `params` argument, which is being passed to it from the `get_updates` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, var_list=params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

By updating the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class to accept `var_list` as an argument, and by passing `var_list=params` in the `get_updates` method, the bug should be fixed.
