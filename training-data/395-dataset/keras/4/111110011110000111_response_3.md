The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method in the MyTFOptimizer class is being called with three arguments instead of the expected two. This points to the `compute_gradients` method being called with an additional parameter `params` which is not being handled properly in the method.

The `compute_gradients` method in MyTFOptimizer class is defined as:
```python
def compute_gradients(self, loss, **kwargs):
    return super(MyTfOptimizer, self).compute_gradients(loss, **kwargs)
```
It takes `loss` as the first positional argument, and any additional keyword arguments are collected in `**kwargs`. However, in the buggy `get_updates` method of TFOptimizer class, the `compute_gradients` method is called with `loss` and `params`, which causes the TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `get_updates` method in TFOptimizer class to handle the extra `params` argument properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

By removing the `params` argument when calling `compute_gradients` and modifying the method to handle only the `loss`, we ensure that the method is compatible with its definition in the MyTfOptimizer class, resolving the TypeError.
