The potential error in the provided code is that the `get_updates` method does not seem to be defined within a class. Typically, this method should be a part of a class that inherits from the `Optimizer` class in Keras.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_updates` method is not properly defined within a class. It is missing the class definition and is not accessing the `self` parameter.

To fix this bug, the `get_updates` method should be defined within a class that inherits from the `Optimizer` class. It should also properly use the `self` parameter to access the class attributes and methods. 

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class CustomOptimizer(Optimizer):
    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        grads = self.compute_gradients(loss, params)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```
