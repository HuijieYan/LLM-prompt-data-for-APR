Potential error location: The issue seems to be within the `compute_gradients` method of the MyTfOptimizer class. It is mentioned in the error message that this method is getting 3 positional arguments but it only takes 2.

Reason for the bug: The error is occurring because the `compute_gradients` method of MyTfOptimizer is not designed to accept three arguments, while the `get_updates` method of TFOptimizer is passing three arguments to it.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `compute_gradients` method of MyTfOptimizer to accept three arguments, or modify the `get_updates` method of TFOptimizer to pass only the required two arguments to the `compute_gradients` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads_and_vars, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
