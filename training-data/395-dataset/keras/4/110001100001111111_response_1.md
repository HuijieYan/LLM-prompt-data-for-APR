The potential error in the provided function is related to the calculation of gradients using the `self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)` method. The error seems to be occurring because the `self.optimizer` object is of type `MyTfOptimizer` instead of the expected type `TFOptimizer`. This type mismatch is causing the `compute_gradients` method to fail.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to ensure that the `self.optimizer` object is of the correct type (`TFOptimizer`). If the `MyTfOptimizer` class is a custom implementation, consider modifying it to inherit from `TFOptimizer` or provide the necessary methods to make it compatible with the `compute_gradients` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, params), global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In the corrected code, the `tf.GradientTape()` context manager is used to compute the gradients. This approach is more flexible and can accommodate different types of optimizers, including custom ones. Additionally, the `apply_gradients` method is used with the `zip(grads, params)` to apply the computed gradients to the parameters.
