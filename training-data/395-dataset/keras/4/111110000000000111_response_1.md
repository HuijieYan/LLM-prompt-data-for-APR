The potential error in the given function is that the method `compute_gradients` is not a valid method of the `self.optimizer` object. 

The reason for the bug is that the `compute_gradients` method is not a standard method for all optimizers in TensorFlow. It seems like the intention here was to compute the gradients using the optimizer, but a more appropriate way to do this is to use the `tf.GradientTape` for automatic differentiation.

To fix the bug, we can use `tf.GradientTape` to compute the gradients and then apply them to the optimizer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class TFOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """
    Wrapper class for native TensorFlow optimizers.
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # fixed function
    @interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            grads = tape.gradient(loss, params)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
            zip(grads, params), global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```

In the corrected code, we use `tf.GradientTape` to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters. Then, we use the `apply_gradients` method of the optimizer to apply these gradients to the parameters.
