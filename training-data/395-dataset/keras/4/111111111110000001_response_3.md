The error message indicates a "TypeError" in the function `compute_gradients()` within the `TFOptimizer` class. The error message states that `compute_gradients()` takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given.

The potential error location is within the `compute_gradients()` method in the `TFOptimizer` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `compute_gradients()` method in the `TFOptimizer` class is being called with three arguments: `loss`, `params`, and `self`, but the method definition only takes two arguments: `loss` and `params`. This inconsistency causes the `TypeError` when the method is called with an additional `self` argument.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `compute_gradients()` method in the `TFOptimizer` class to accept the `self` parameter.
2. Modify the calls to `compute_gradients()` to only pass `loss` and `params`, not including `self`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class TFOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """
    Wrapper class for native TensorFlow optimizers.
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(self, loss, params)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
            grads, global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```

In the corrected code, the `compute_gradients()` method now accepts `self` as the first argument, and when called, it is passed the `self` parameter explicitly.
