The bug in the provided function `standardize_weights` is that it does not correctly handle the case when `sample_weight` array's shape and dimensions are not as expected when `sample_weight_mode` is set to "temporal". This leads to the function raising ValueError for incorrect shape and dimensions.

The bug in the code is that it is not handling `sample_weight_mode` correctly, leading to incorrect shape and dimension checks for `sample_weight`. Additionally, the function does not handle the case when both `sample_weight` and `class_weight` are provided, and it does not consider all conditions that need to be checked for properly standardizing the weights.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made to the function:
1. Modify the condition `if sample_weight_mode is not None` to check for the correctness of `sample_weight` array's shape and dimension based on the `sample_weight_mode`.
2. Add a check if both `sample_weight` and `class_weight` are provided, and provide appropriate handling for such cases.
3. Adjust the checks for `sample_weight` and `class_weight` so that the weights are standardized correctly based on the input provided.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode == 'temporal':
        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Timestep-wise sample weighting is restricted to outputs that are at least 3D.')
        if sample_weight is not None and sample_weight.ndim != 2:
            raise ValueError('For timestep-wise sample weighting, pass a 2D sample_weight array.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: `class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if sample_weight.ndim > y.ndim:
            raise ValueError('Invalid sample_weight shape for the input shape.')
        if np.any(y.shape[-sample_weight.ndim:] != sample_weight.shape):
            raise ValueError('sample_weight shape is not compatible with the input shape.')
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 2:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for 3+ dimensional targets.')
        if y.shape[1] > 1:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
        elif y.shape[1] == 1:
            y_classes = np.reshape(y, y.shape[0])
        else:
            y_classes = y
        weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] if cls in class_weight else 1.0 for cls in y_classes])
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=np.float32)
        else:
            return np.ones(y.shape, dtype=np.float32)
```
