The issue with the function is that it is not returning the standardized weights as expected. In the provided test cases, the function is expected to return the standardized weights for each input sample.

The problem occurs in the 'else' block at the end of the function. In this part of the code, if 'sample_weight' is None, and the 'class_weight' is neither None nor a dict, the function should return an array of ones. However, in the else block, it currently returns an array of ones with the shape of 'y' when 'sample_weight_mode' is None.

To fix this issue, the function should return an array of ones with the shape of 'y' when both 'sample_weight' and 'class_weight' are None. If 'class_weight' is a dict, it should calculate the weights based on the 'y_classes' and return them.

Here's the corrected function:
