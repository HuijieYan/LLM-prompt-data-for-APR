The error occurs when the function `standardize_weights` is called with input parameters `y` and `class_weight` for the third test of the `test_sample_weights` function in `test_training.py`. This triggers an `IndexError` on line 503 of the function `standardize_weights`, specifically when the condition `if y.shape[1] > 1` is evaluated, which implies that `y` is expected to have a second dimension.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that `y` is a 2D array, but it's actually a 1D array in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle both 1D and 2D arrays. We can consider `y` as a 1D array when it is passed without any second dimension.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    """Performs sample weight validation and standardization.

    Everything gets normalized to a single sample-wise (or timestep-wise)
    weight array.

    # Arguments
        y: Numpy array of model targets to be weighted.
        sample_weight: User-provided `sample_weight` argument.
        class_weight: User-provided `class_weight` argument.
        sample_weight_mode: One of `None` or `"temporal"`.
            `"temporal"` indicated that we expect 2D weight data
            that will be applied to the last 2 dimensions of
            the targets (i.e. we are weighting timesteps, not samples).

    # Returns
        A Numpy array of target weights, one entry per sample to weight.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of invalid user-provided arguments.
