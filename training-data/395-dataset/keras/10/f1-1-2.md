# buggy function docstring

```text
Performs sample weight validation and standardization.

Everything gets normalized to a single sample-wise (or timestep-wise)
weight array.

# Arguments
    y: Numpy array of model targets to be weighted.
    sample_weight: User-provided `sample_weight` argument.
    class_weight: User-provided `class_weight` argument.
    sample_weight_mode: One of `None` or `"temporal"`.
        `"temporal"` indicated that we expect 2D weight data
        that will be applied to the last 2 dimensions of
        the targets (i.e. we are weighting timesteps, not samples).

# Returns
    A Numpy array of target weights, one entry per sample to weight.

# Raises
    ValueError: In case of invalid user-provided arguments.
