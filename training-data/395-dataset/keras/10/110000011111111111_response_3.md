The bug in the provided function occurs because of an incorrect index being used in the conditional statements. The error message indicates an "IndexError: tuple index out of range" which points to the line "if y.shape[1] > 1:". This statement is attempting to access the second dimension of the 'y' variable which only has one dimension, causing an index out of range error.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement "if y.shape[1] > 1:" should be replaced with "if len(y.shape) > 1:". This modification ensures that we are checking the length of the shape tuple instead of directly accessing the second element of the tuple (which doesn't exist in 1D arrays).

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
