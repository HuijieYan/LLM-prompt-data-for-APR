The issue with the code is in the conditional statements for handling `class_weight` and `sample_weight` arrays. The code is not correctly handling the different combinations of these two arrays.

The bug occurs because the function fails to handle the case when both `sample_weight` and `class_weight` are provided, as well as the case when neither is provided. Additionally, the code contains redundant logic.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle all possible combinations of `sample_weight_mode`, `sample_weight`, and `class_weight` and return the appropriate weights based on these inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '
                             'should be None or "temporal". '
                             'Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for '
                             'an input with shape ' +
                             str(y.shape) + '. '
                             'Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of '
                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to '
                             'outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have '
                             'a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None:
            if len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
                raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                                 str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '

                                 'you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
            return sample_weight
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=np.float32)
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None:
            if len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
                raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                                 str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '
                                 'In order to use sample-wise sample weights, '
                                 'you should pass a 1D sample_weight array.')
            return sample_weight
        elif class_weight is not None:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1) if y.shape[1] > 1 else y
            weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes
                                  if cls in class_weight])
            if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
                existing_classes = set(y_classes)
                existing_class_weight = set(class_weight.keys())
                raise ValueError('`class_weight` must contain all classes in the data.'
                                 ' The classes %s exist in the data but not in '
                                 '`class_weight`.' % (existing_classes - existing_class_weight))
            return weights
        else:
