The bug occurs in the `standardize_weights` function in the conditions where both `sample_weight` and `class_weight` are not None. In these conditions, the function should return a warning that `class_weight` will be ignored, but instead, it is returning `sample_weight`.

The bug occurs because the function logic does not handle this specific condition and does not return the intended warning message. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to correctly handle the case where both `sample_weight` and `class_weight` are not None. We should include a warning message and return the weights based on the `class_weight` if it is not None. We should also remove the unnecessary else condition and combine the nested if statements for better readability.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
import keras.backend as K

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('sample_weight_mode should be None or "temporal". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape ' + str(y.shape) + '. Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    elif sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
        raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, you should specify sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile(). If you just mean to use sample-wise weights, make sure your sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: `class_weight` argument will be ignored.')
        if isinstance(class_weight, dict):
            if len(y.shape) > 2:
                raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for 3+ dimensional targets.')
            if y.shape[1] > 1:
                y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
            elif y.shape[1] == 1:
                y_classes = np.reshape(y, y.shape[0])
            else:
                y_classes = y

            weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes if cls in class_weight])

            if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
                existing_classes = set(y_classes)
                existing_class_weight = set(class_weight.keys())
                raise ValueError('`class_weight` must contain all classes in the data. The classes %s exist in the data but not in `class_weight`.' % (existing_classes - existing_class_weight))
            return weights
    if sample_weight_mode is None:
        return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
    else:
        return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=K.floatx())
```
I have restructured the function to handle the scenarios where both `sample_weight` and `class_weight` are not None. Also, I have removed the ambiguous else condition and combined the nested if statements for better readability. This should fix the bug and improve the function's accuracy.
