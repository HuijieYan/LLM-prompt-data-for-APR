The issue with the `standardize_weights` function is that it does not return the expected output and raises various ValueError exceptions based on the input parameters.

The bug arises due to the mismatch in the shape and dimensionality of the input arrays `y` and `sample_weight`. The function checks for different conditions related to the shape and dimension of `y` and `sample_weight`, and if they do not meet the expected criteria, it raises ValueErrors.

To fix the bug, the function should first check for the conditions related to the input arrays and then perform the necessary operations accordingly. In the provided test case, the function is called with `y` and `sample_weight`, and it should return the `sample_weight` array itself because it meets the required conditions.

Below is the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('sample_weight_mode should be None or "temporal". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape ' + str(y.shape) + '. Timestep-wise sample weighting is restricted to 1D input.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 1D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use sample weights, the sample_weight array should be 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: `class_weight` argument will be ignored.')
    elif sample_weight is not None:
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        weights = np.array([class_weight[cls] for cls in y])
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())

# test the corrected function with the provided test case
y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0, 2])
sample_weight = np.array([0.5, 1., 1., 0., 2.])

output = standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=sample_weight)
print(output)  # Output will be the sample_weight array itself
```
