The error message indicates an "IndexError: tuple index out of range" in the file `keras/engine/training_utils.py` at line 503. The test function `test_sample_weights` is calling the `standardize_weights` function with the `class_weight` argument, which seems to be causing the issue.

The potential error is likely in the `standardize_weights` function at the condition: `if y.shape[1] > 1:` which is trying to access the second dimension of `y`, but it assumes that `y` has at least two dimensions, leading to the IndexError when the assumption is not met.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the shape of `y` without properly checking its dimensions, leading to the potential out-of-range tuple index error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the dimensions of `y` are checked properly before trying to access its second dimension.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
import keras.backend as K

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode == 'temporal':
        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape ' +
                             str(y.shape) + '. Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of ' +
                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to outputs that are at least 3D, ' +
                             'i.e. that have a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, ' +
                             'you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    elif sample_weight_mode is None:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, ' +
                             'you should specify sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile(). If you just mean to use ' +
                             'sample-wise weights, make sure your sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: `class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. Expected sample_weight with rank ' +
                             'less than or equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))

        if len(sample_weight.shape) == 1:
            sample_weight = sample_weight[:, np.newaxis]  # Convert to column vector
        if sample_weight.shape[0] != y.shape[0]:
            raise ValueError('The number of samples in sample_weight is not equal to the number of samples in y.')

        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 2:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for 3+ dimensional targets.')

        if len(y.shape) == 1:
            y_classes = y
        else:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)

        weights = np.asarray([class_weight.get(cls, 1.0) for cls in y_classes])
        
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=K.floatx())
```

In this corrected code:
- The handling of `sample_weight` and `class_weight` has been improved to properly validate their shapes and conditions.
- Additional checks have been included to ensure that the dimensions of `y` and weights match appropriately.
