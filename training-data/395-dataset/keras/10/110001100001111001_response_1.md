The bug occurs because the condition checks are not consistent with the input parameters. The function expects `y` to be an array with a shape of at least 3D and expects a sample_weight array with a shape of 2D, or a class_weight dictionary for 1D arrays. However, the condition checks are not consistent nor accurate, leading to the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks to accurately validate the shapes and dimensions of the sample_weight and y arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode should be None or "temporal". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        
        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError(f'Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape {y.shape}. Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have a time dimension.')
        
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError(f'Found a sample_weight array with shape {sample_weight.shape}. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError(f'Found a sample_weight array with shape {sample_weight.shape}. In order to use sample-wise weights, make sure your sample_weight array is 1D.')
    
    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError(f'Found a sample_weight with shape {sample_weight.shape}. Expected sample_weight with rank less than or equal to {len(y.shape)}')
        
        if y.shape[:sample_weight.ndim] != sample_weight.shape:
            raise ValueError(f'Found a sample_weight array with shape {sample_weight.shape} for an input with shape {y.shape}. sample_weight cannot be broadcast.')
        
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 2:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for 3+ dimensional targets.')
        
        if y.shape[0] > 1:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
        elif y.shape[0] == 1:
            y_classes = np.reshape(y, y.shape[1])
        else:
            y_classes = y
        
        weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes if cls in class_weight])
        
        if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
            existing_classes = set(y_classes)
            existing_class_weight = set(class_weight.keys())
            raise ValueError(f'`class_weight` must contain all classes in the data. The classes {existing_classes - existing_class_weight} exist in the data but not in `class_weight`.')
        
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=np.float32)
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=np.float32)
