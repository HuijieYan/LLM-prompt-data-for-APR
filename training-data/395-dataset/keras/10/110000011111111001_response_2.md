The error occurs because the function does not handle the case when class_weight is specified and y.shape has only one dimension. This causes an IndexError when trying to access y.shape[1].

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case when class_weight is specified and y.shape has only one dimension. We can check for the dimensionality of y and handle the class_weight accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    """Performs sample weight validation and standardization.

    Everything gets normalized to a single sample-wise (or timestep-wise)
    weight array.

    # Arguments
        y: Numpy array of model targets to be weighted.
        sample_weight: User-provided `sample_weight` argument.
        class_weight: User-provided `class_weight` argument.
        sample_weight_mode: One of `None` or `"temporal"`.
            `"temporal"` indicated that we expect 2D weight data
            that will be applied to the last 2 dimensions of
            the targets (i.e. we are weighting timesteps, not samples).

    # Returns
        A Numpy array of target weights, one entry per sample to weight.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of invalid user-provided arguments.
