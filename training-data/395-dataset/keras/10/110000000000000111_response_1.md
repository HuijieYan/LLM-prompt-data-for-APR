The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that check the validity of the sample_weight and class_weight arguments. The function currently throws ValueError in various scenarios related to the shape and dimensions of these arguments, but the implementation of these checks is not accurate.

The bug occurs because the conditional statements are not effectively checking the shape and dimensions of the sample_weight and class_weight arguments. Instead, they are throwing errors based on incorrect conditions and assumptions about the input shapes. 

To fix the bug, the conditional statements need to be revised to accurately check the shape and dimensions of the sample_weight and class_weight arguments. Additionally, the error messages should be updated to provide more useful information about why the conditions were not met.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        # Check if sample_weight_mode is valid
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal' and sample_weight_mode != 'spatial':
            raise ValueError('sample_weight_mode should be None, "temporal", or "spatial". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        
        # Check if sample_weight is provided and has valid dimensions
        if sample_weight is not None:
            if sample_weight_mode == 'temporal' and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
                raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
            elif sample_weight_mode == 'spatial' and sample_weight.ndim != len(y.shape):
                raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. Expected sample_weight with rank equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))
    
    else:
        # Check if sample_weight is provided and has valid dimensions for spatial mode
        if sample_weight is not None:
            if sample_weight.ndim != 1:
                raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use sample-wise weights, make sure your sample_weight array is 1D.')
        
        # Check if class_weight is a dictionary and has valid dimensions
        if isinstance(class_weight, dict):
            if len(y.shape) > 2:
                raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for 3+ dimensional targets.')
            
            if len(y.shape) > 1 and y.shape[1] > 1:
                y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
            else:
                y_classes = y
                
            weights = np.array([class_weight.get(cls, 1) for cls in y_classes])
            return weights
        else:
            # Return weights based on the mode (spatial or temporal)
            if sample_weight_mode is None and sample_weight is None:
                return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
            else:
                return np.ones(y.shape, dtype=K.floatx())
