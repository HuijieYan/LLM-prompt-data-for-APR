Potential error location:
The `separable_conv1d` function is trying to call `tf.nn.separable_conv2d`, which is a 2D convolution operation, instead of a 1D convolution operation.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `separable_conv1d` is using the `tf.nn.separable_conv2d` operation, which is meant for 2D convolutions, instead of using a 1D convolution operation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the appropriate 1D convolution operation for the separable convolution in the `separable_conv1d` function.
2. Modify the implementation to use the correct 1D convolution operation that aligns with the function's purpose.
3. Update the function to handle 1D separable convolutions directly without using the 2D operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def separable_conv1d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel, strides=1,
                     padding='valid', data_format=None, dilation_rate=1):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    x, tf_data_format = _preprocess_conv1d_input(x, data_format)
    padding = _preprocess_padding(padding)

    x = tf.expand_dims(x, 1)
    depthwise_kernel = tf.expand_dims(depthwise_kernel, 0)
    pointwise_kernel = tf.expand_dims(pointwise_kernel, 0)

    x = tf.nn.separable_conv1d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel,
                               stride=strides,
                               padding=padding,
                               rate=dilation_rate)

    x = tf.squeeze(x, 1)

    if data_format == 'channels_first' and tf_data_format == 'NHWC':
        x = tf.transpose(x, (0, 2, 1))  # NWC -> NCW

    return x
```
The corrected code modifies the function to use `tf.nn.separable_conv1d` for 1D separable convolutions instead of `tf.nn.separable_conv2d`.
