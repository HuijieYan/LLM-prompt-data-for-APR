The error message indicates that the separable_conv1d function is using incorrect strides. This is causing an InvalidArgumentError related to strides not being of equal length in the row and column dimensions.

The error is likely occurring in the calculation or assignment of the 'strides' variable in the separable_conv1d function.

To fix the bug, the 'strides' variable needs to be properly calculated and assigned. It should be a tuple and the length of the tuple should match the spatial dimensionality of the input tensor. Additionally, if the data_format is 'channels_first', the position at which the stride is applied needs to be adjusted to match the dimensionality of the input.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def separable_conv1d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel, strides=1,
                     padding='valid', data_format=None, dilation_rate=1):
    """1D convolution with separable filters.

    # Arguments
        x: input tensor
        depthwise_kernel: convolution kernel for the depthwise convolution.
        pointwise_kernel: kernel for the 1x1 convolution.
        strides: int or tuple of ints, strides along the spatial dimension. Default is 1.
        padding: string, `"same"` or `"valid"`.
        data_format: string, `"channels_last"` or `"channels_first"`.
        dilation_rate: integer dilation rate.

    # Returns
        Output tensor.

    # Raises
        ValueError: if `data_format` is neither `channels_last` or `channels_first`.
    """
    if data_format is None:
        data_format = image_data_format()
    if data_format not in {'channels_first', 'channels_last'}:
        raise ValueError('Unknown data_format: ' + str(data_format))

    x, tf_data_format = _preprocess_conv1d_input(x, data_format)
    padding = _preprocess_padding(padding)
    
    if tf_data_format == 'NHWC':
        strides = (1,) + (strides,)
    else:
        strides = (1,) + (1,) + (strides,)
        
    x = tf.expand_dims(x, 1) # Adjust spatial dimension start position based on data format
    depthwise_kernel = tf.expand_dims(depthwise_kernel, 0)
    pointwise_kernel = tf.expand_dims(pointwise_kernel, 0)
    dilation_rate = (1,) + dilation_rate

    x = tf.nn.separable_conv2d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel,
                               strides=strides,
                               padding=padding,
                               rate=dilation_rate,
                               data_format=tf_data_format)

    x = tf.squeeze(x, 1) # Squeeze based on spatial dimension start position

    if data_format == 'channels_first' and tf_data_format == 'NHWC':
        x = tf.transpose(x, (0, 2, 1))  # NWC -> NCW

    return x
```

In the corrected function, the strides variable is properly adjusted based on the data_format and spatial dimensionality of the input tensor. It is now a tuple and has the correct length based on the spatial dimensions. Additionally, the position at which the stride is applied has been adjusted to match the dimensionality of the input.
