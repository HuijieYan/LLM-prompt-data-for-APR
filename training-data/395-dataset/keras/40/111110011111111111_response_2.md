The problem occurs in the `compute_output_shape` function of the `RNN` class. The error message indicates that the expected and actual output shapes do not match at index 3: (None, 6) != (None, 3).

The issue arises because when `self.cell.state_size` has a len() greater than 1, the value is incorrectly being assigned to `output_dim` without considering the order of the states. Consequently, the `state_shape` is also being incorrectly calculated based on this incorrect `output_dim` value.

To fix this issue, we need to consider all the elements of `self.cell.state_size` when calculating `output_dim` and `state_shape`.

Below is the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = sum(self.cell.state_size)   # Sum of all elements in state_size
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], s) for s in self.cell.state_size]
        else:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim)]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this change, the `output_dim` now represents the sum of all elements in `self.cell.state_size`, and `state_shape` is calculated based on each element of `self.cell.state_size`. This ensures that the output shape and state shape are calculated correctly, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected output from the test case.
