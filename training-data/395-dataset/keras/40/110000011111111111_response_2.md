The error occurs in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class. It seems that the `state_shape` is not being calculated correctly. The bug occurs because the `state_shape` is being calculated using a placeholder value of `self.states` instead of using the actual state sizes from `self.cell.state_size`.

To fix this bug, the correct state sizes should be used to calculate the `state_shape`. Additionally, it seems that the calculation of the `state_shape` is incomplete and should include the second LSTM cell state size as well.

The corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method is as follows:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], dim) for dim in self.cell.state_size]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
