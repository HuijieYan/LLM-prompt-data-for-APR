The error occurs in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class in the `recurrent.py` file. The issue is with the `state_shape` calculation. It is expecting the last state to have a different shape than what is being calculated, causing the assertion error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the last state shape is being incorrectly calculated by the `compute_output_shape` method.

To fix this bug, the `compute_output_shape` method should be modified to calculate the last state differently based on the number of cells in the stacked RNN. It should also consider whether `return_sequences` and `return_state` are set to `True` or `False`. The shape calculation for the last state should be aligned with the properties of the RNN layer.

Here's the corrected `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
# Corrected compute_output_shape method
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size[i]) for i in range(len(self.cell.state_size))] if isinstance(self.cell.state_size, (list, tuple)) else [(input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size) for _ in range(len(self.cell.cell))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

This corrected method calculates the state shape based on the cell's state size and the number of cells. It also considers whether `return_sequences` and `return_state` are `True` or `False` and aligns the state shape calculation accordingly.

With this correction, the `compute_output_shape` method should now properly calculate the output shape and align with the expectations in the test case.
