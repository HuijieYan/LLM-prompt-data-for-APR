The bug in the `compute_output_shape` function is likely caused by the incorrect calculation of the state_shape. The list of state_shape is being created based on the number of states, but the actual content of the state_shape is not calculated correctly.

The bug occurs because the length of the list of states (self.states) is used to determine the number of tuples in state_shape, but then the tuples in state_shape are filled with the same value rather than using the dims from `self.cell.state_size` for each element of `self.states`.

To fix the bug, the compute_output_shape function should correctly calculate the state_shape based on the actual state sizes in `self.cell.state_size`. The output_dim and state_shape should be calculated based on the actual state sizes of the RNN cell.

Here's the corrected code for the compute_output_shape function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], s) for s in self.cell.state_size]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

By using the actual state sizes in `self.cell.state_size` to populate the `state_shape`, the corrected code ensures that the state_shape is calculated correctly based on the dimensions of each state in the RNN cell. This should resolve the bug and align the output_shape and state_shape with the expected values in the test case.
