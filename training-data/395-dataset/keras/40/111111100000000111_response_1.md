The potential error lies in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class. The error occurs because the `states` method is defined twice with the same name, which is not allowed in Python.

To fix the bug, you need to rename one of the `states` methods to something else.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In this corrected code, the `states` method is used without any changes, but it's important to note that the `states` method should have different names to avoid ambiguity.
