The potential error in the code is that the `compute_output_shape` method is not implemented correctly. It is trying to access `self.cell.state_size`, but it's missing the parentheses to call the method. Additionally, `self.states` is used but not declared in the method.

The error occurs because the `state_size` and `states` methods are not being used properly. They need to be called with parentheses to obtain their return values.

To fix the bug, the `compute_output_shape` method should be modified as follows:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    state_size = self.cell.state_size()
  
    if hasattr(state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states()]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
