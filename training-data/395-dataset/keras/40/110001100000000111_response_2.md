Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the use of `self.states` which is not defined within the function.

Reason for the bug: The variable `self.states` is being used without being defined or initialized within the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. If `self.states` is meant to be a class attribute, it should be defined and initialized in the `__init__` method of the class.
2. If `self.states` is meant to be an argument to the function, it should be included as an input parameter to the `compute_output_shape` method.

Corrected code:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape, states=None): # Include states as an input parameter
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state and states: # Check if states is provided
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in states] # Use the provided states
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
