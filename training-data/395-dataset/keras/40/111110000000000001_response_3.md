The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if the attribute `self.states` exists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, which means that you cannot have two functions with the same name within the same class.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove one of the `states` functions and rename the other one to a different name.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        if isinstance(input_shape, list):
            input_shape = input_shape[0]
    
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size
    
        if self.return_sequences:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    
        if self.return_state:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
            return [output_shape] + state_shape
        else:
            return output_shape
```
