Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `compute_output_shape` function, specifically in the calculation of `state_shape`. The `state_shape` calculation is expecting the length of `self.states` to be used for the loop and the list index, but `self.states` is not being passed as an argument to the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `self.states` variable is not being used as an argument in the `compute_output_shape` function, but it is referenced in the calculation of `state_shape`. As a result, the length of `self.states` is not being used to generate the `state_shape` list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Pass `self.states` as an argument to the `compute_output_shape` function.
2. If `self.states` cannot be used directly, consider an alternative approach for determining the length of `self.states` or manually specifying the length required for `state_shape`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape, states=None):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        if states is None:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        else:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected code:
1. Added an optional 'states' parameter to the `compute_output_shape` function signature.
2. Used the 'states' parameter to determine the length of 'state_shape' if it is provided, otherwise used the length of `self.states`. 
3. Replaced `self.states` with `states` for consistency and clarity.


This should address the issue and provide the expected behavior for the function.
