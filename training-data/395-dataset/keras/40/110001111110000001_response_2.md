The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output shape and the actual output shape of the `compute_output_shape` function when tested with the `test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape` test case.

The potential error location within the `compute_output_shape` function is likely the calculation of the `state_shape` when `self.return_state` is true. The error is occurring because the calculated `state_shape` is not matching the expected output shape based on the test case.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the `state_shape` calculation when the `self.return_state` condition is true. It seems that the calculation is not considering the correct dimensions or not matching the expected output structure.

To fix the bug, the `state_shape` calculation needs to be revised to correctly generate the output shape based on the `self.states` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With the corrected code, the `state_shape` will be calculated based on the correct dimensions and will match the expected output structure, resolving the bug.
