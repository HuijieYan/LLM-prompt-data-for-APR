Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring when computing the state_shape value. It is expected to be a list of tuples, but it is currently determined incorrectly, leading to a mismatch with the expected value.

Reason for the bug: The "state_shape" variable is being assigned an incorrect value. This occurs due to a mismatch in the logic used to determine the state_shape based on the input parameters and the return state states of the RNN layer.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The compute_output_shape() function should be modified to correctly calculate the state_shape based on the return state states of the RNN layer. This can be achieved by iterating through the "self.states" list and creating tuples with the appropriate dimensions.

Corrected code:
```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
