The error is occurring in the `compute_output_shape` function. The bug is caused by using `self.states` without actually initializing or setting it within the class. It seems like the intention was to use the `states` function, but it's mistakenly referred to as a property.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to remove the references to `self.states` and instead use the `states` input argument passed to the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(states)]  # Fix the reference to 'states'
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
