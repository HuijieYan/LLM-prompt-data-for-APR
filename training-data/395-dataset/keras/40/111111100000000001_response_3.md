The potential error in the given code is the use of identical function names for different purposes within the same class: `states`.

The reason for the bug is that in Python, you cannot have two functions with the same name in a single class. This is because when the class is defined, only the last function with the same name will be stored, overwriting any previous functions with the same name.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to rename the functions to have distinct names. For example, we can rename the first `states` function to `get_states` and the second `states` function to `set_states`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.get_states()]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
