The error occurs in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class, as indicated by the test case and the error message. The expected output shape includes a mismatch between the expected and actual output shapes, specifically at index 3 where the expected shape is `(None, 3)` and the actual shape is `(None, 6)`.

The bug in the `compute_output_shape` method is because it incorrectly handles the return state shape calculation when `return_sequences` is True and `return_state` is also True. This leads to a discrepancy between the expected and actual output shapes.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the calculation of the output shape and the state shape when both `return_sequences` and `return_state` are True.

Here's the corrected `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        if isinstance(self.cell.state_size, list):
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], s) for s in self.cell.state_size]
        else:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size)]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected method, the code now correctly handles the return state shape calculation when both `return_sequences` and `return_state` are True. This should resolve the discrepancy in the output shapes and fix the bug.
