The error occurs when the `output_shape` does not match the `expected_output_shape`. Specifically, the dimensions of the states are not matching.

The bug is likely occurring in the `compute_output_shape` function where the dimensions of the states are being computed.

The bug occurs because the computation of the state dimension is incorrect. The issue seems to be in the following section of code:
```python
if self.return_state:
    state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]
    return [output_shape] + state_shape
```
The `self.states` variable here is unclear, and it's possibly not a list, which results in computing the dimensions incorrectly for the states.

One possible approach to fixing the bug would be to ensure that `self.states` is being used correctly and that it has the appropriate dimensions for computation. Additionally, the computation of state dimensions should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In this corrected code, we have fixed the `state_shape` computation section by iterating over the length of the state dimensions (`len(self.cell.state_size)`) to ensure correct state dimensions are computed. Additionally, the loop variable `_` is used to indicate that the loop is not dependent on `self.states`, which may not exist or have appropriate dimensions.
