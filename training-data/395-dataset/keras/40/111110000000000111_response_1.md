The function `compute_output_shape` in the given code has a bug where it tries to access the `state_shape` using `self.states` which is not defined anywhere in the code. It seems like the intention was to access the states defined in the RNN cell, but it's not done correctly.

The bug occurs because the code assumes `self.states` exists, but it's not defined anywhere in the provided code. It should have been `self.cell.states` instead, as the states are defined within the RNN cell.

To fix the bug, the function should access the states through the RNN cell, and it should also initialize the `state_shape` as an empty list if `self.return_state` is false.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
