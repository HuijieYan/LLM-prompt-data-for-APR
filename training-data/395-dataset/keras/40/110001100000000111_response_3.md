Potential Errors:
1. The function is trying to access the `state_size` attribute of `self.cell`, which may not exist or may not be an iterable as expected.
2. The function is trying to access `self.states` without any prior declaration or definition.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The use of `self.cell.state_size` without proper error handling can lead to AttributeError if the attribute does not exist.
2. Accessing `self.states` without any prior definition can lead to NameError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.cell.state_size` exists before trying to access its length.
2. Define `self.states` before using it as list comprehension can lead to a NameError if it's not defined.

Corrected Code:
```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell, 'state_size') and hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        if hasattr(self, 'states'):  # Check if self.states is defined
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]
        else:
            state_shape = []  # Handle the case when self.states is not defined
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
