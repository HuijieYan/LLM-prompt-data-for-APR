The buggy function is `compute_output_shape` within the `RNN` class. It is producing an incorrect output based on the `test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape` test function. The error message indicates that at index 3, the expected value is `(None, 3)` while the actual output is `(None, 6)`.

The bug is likely occurring due to the miscalculation of the state shapes and output shape in the `compute_output_shape` function. This is possibly due to incorrect handling of the dimensions and states, leading to mismatched shapes.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `compute_output_shape` function needs to be corrected. Specifically, the calculation of `state_shape` needs to be consistent with the actual state dimensions. Additionally, the handling of `self.states` also needs to be reviewed to ensure that it correctly captures the state dimensions.

Here's the corrected `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]  # Use range(len(self.states)) to match states count
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With these corrections, the `output_shape` and `state_shape` are calculated based on the correct dimensions and sizes, ensuring that the output matches the expected values in the test function.
