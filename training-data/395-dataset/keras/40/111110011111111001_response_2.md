The error is raised because the computed `output_shape` does not match the expected `expected_output_shape`. Specifically, the last two elements in `expected_output_shape` are `(None, 3)` and `(None, 3)`, whereas the last two elements in `output_shape` are `(None, 6)` and `(None, 6)`.

The potential error in the function is the calculation of the `state_shape` list, where it does not align with the expected output. This discrepancy is caused by the `states` attribute being incorrectly accessed and used within the `compute_output_shape` method.

To fix the bug, the `compute_output_shape` function needs to correctly calculate the `state_shape` based on the `states` attribute of the RNN layer.

The corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method is as follows:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In this corrected code, the `state_shape` is calculated based on the length of `self.states` rather than the length of `self.states` itself. Additionally, `range(len(self.states))` is used to ensure that the correct shape is generated for the state.
