The test is for the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class in the `recurrent.py` file. The method is expected to compute the output shape based on the input shape and the settings of the RNN layer.

From the error message, it can be seen that the expected output shape is `[(None, 5, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 3), (None, 3)]` but the actual output shape is `[(None, 5, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6)]`. The discrepancy is at index 3 where the expected shape is `(None, 3)` but the actual shape is `(None, 6)`.

The potential error in the `compute_output_shape` method might be due to the incorrect computation of `state_shape` based on the state size and the settings of the RNN layer.

The bug occurs because the `state_shape` is not being calculated correctly. The problem is in the line where state_shape is being generated based on the length of self.states, which is not the correct way to calculate state_shape.

To fix the bug, the `state_shape` should be calculated based on the actual state sizes obtained from `self.cell.state_size`.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], s) for s in self.cell.state_size]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this correction, the `state_shape` is calculated based on the actual state sizes obtained from `self.cell.state_size`. This should address the issue and make the `compute_output_shape` method behave as expected.
