The error occurs because there are two methods with the same name `states` defined in the `RNN` class. This leads to the class overriding the first `states` method with the second `states` method, causing the unexpected behavior in the function.

To fix this issue, it's necessary to remove the first `states` method as it is redundant and causes ambiguity in the function calls.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
