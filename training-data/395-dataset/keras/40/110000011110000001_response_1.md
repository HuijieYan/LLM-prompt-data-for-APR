The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output shape and the actual output shape. Specifically, at index 3, the expected shape is (None, 3) while the actual shape is (None, 6). This suggests that the bug is likely related to the calculation of the output shape in the `compute_output_shape` function.

The bug likely occurs because the function is not correctly handling the state shapes when `self.return_state` is True. The function is returning the state shape as (input_shape[0], output_dim) for each state instead of returning the correct output.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly handle the return of the state shape when `self.return_state` is True.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.cell.state_size]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this correction, the `compute_output_shape` function should now correctly handle the return of the state shapes and the error should be resolved.
