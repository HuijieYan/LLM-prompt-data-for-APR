The error occurs because the `state_shape` is not correctly computed. Instead of creating a list of tuples with the shape `(None, 6)` four times, it creates a list with shapes `(None, 6)`, `(None, 6)`, `(None, 3)`, and `(None, 3)`.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect calculation of the `state_shape` list, which should have the same shape as `output_shape` if `self.return_state` is `True`.

To fix this bug, the computation of `state_shape` should be modified to create a list of tuples with the same shape as `output_shape`. This can be achieved by iterating over the length of `self.states` and appending tuples with shape `(input_shape[0], output_dim)` to the `state_shape` list.

Here's the corrected `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this correction, the `state_shape` list will have the same shape as `output_shape`, and the test case should now pass without errors.
