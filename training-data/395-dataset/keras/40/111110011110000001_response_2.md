The test case is attempting to verify the output shape of a stacked RNN using the `compute_output_shape` method. The expected output shape is provided, but the actual output shape is different, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error location within the `compute_output_shape` method is the computation of the `state_shape` when `self.return_state` is true.

The bug occurs because the dimensions of the `state_shape` are not being calculated correctly. The size of the states does not match the expected size provided in the `expected_output_shape`, causing the assertion error.

To fix this bug, the `state_shape` should be calculated correctly based on the dimensions of the states, and it should match the expected shape.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = []
        for state in self.cell.state_size:
            state_shape.append((input_shape[0], state))
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected code, the `state_shape` is calculated based on the dimensions of the states, and it is appended to the return value when `self.return_state` is true. This ensures that the output shape matches the expected shape and resolves the bug.
