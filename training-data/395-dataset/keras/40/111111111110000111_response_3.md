Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the `compute_output_shape` function of the `RNN` class. The error message from the test case indicates that the output shapes do not match as expected, specifically at index 3.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely due to a mismatch in the output shape calculation logic within the `compute_output_shape` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `state_shape` is being calculated correctly and if it is compatible with the expected output shapes.
2. Ensure that the dimensions and shapes of the outputs are correctly handled when returning the computed output shapes.
3. Verify that the conditions for `return_sequences` and `return_state` flags are appropriately considered while computing the output shape.

Corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

Changes made:
1. The `for _ in self.states` has been changed to `for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))` to correctly iterate over the state sizes.
2. The calculation of `state_shape` now ensures that the correct shapes are returned based on the number of states and their output dimensions.
