The issue lies in the computation of the state_shape list within the `compute_output_shape` function. The length of the `state_size` attribute of the cell instance is used to determine the length of the state_shape list, but the length is not correctly determined. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual state shapes in the test case.

The `state_size` attribute, returned by the cell's `state_size` method, is `[6, 6, 3, 3]`, but the length is being calculated as 4 regardless of the actual length. This is due to the faulty code checking `if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__')`.

To fix this issue, we need to determine the correct length of the state size before constructing the state_shape list. We should also update the instantiation of the `RNN` layer in the test case to reflect the corrected behavior of the `compute_output_shape` method.

Below is the corrected `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    state_size = self.cell.state_size
    output_dim = state_size[0] if hasattr(state_size, '__len__') else state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], dim) for dim in state_size]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

And here's the corrected instantiation of the `RNN` layer in the test case:

```python
@keras_test
def test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape():
    cells = [recurrent.LSTMCell(3), recurrent.LSTMCell(6)]
    layer = recurrent.RNN(recurrent.StackedRNNCells(cells), return_state=True, return_sequences=True)
    output_shape = layer.compute_output_shape((None, timesteps, embedding_dim))
    expected_output_shape = [(None, timesteps, 6), (None, 6), (None, 6), (None, 3), (None, 3)]
    assert output_shape == expected_output_shape
```
