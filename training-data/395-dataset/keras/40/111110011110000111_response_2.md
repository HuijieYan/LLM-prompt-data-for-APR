The error message shows that the expected output shape does not match the actual output shape. The specific difference occurs at index 3, where the expected shape is (None, 3) but the actual shape is (None, 6).

The buggy function is `compute_output_shape` in the `RNN` class. The issue is likely related to the calculation of the output shapes based on the input parameters and the properties of the RNN cell.

The bug occurs because the implementation of `compute_output_shape` does not properly account for the return state and whether `cell.state_size` is a single value or a list.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `compute_output_shape` method to accurately calculate the output shapes based on the input parameters and the properties of the RNN cell. 

Here's the corrected `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]  # First entry
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], unit) for unit in self.cell.state_size]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected method, we properly handle the case when `cell.state_size` is a list and calculate the state shape based on this information. Additionally, when calculating `state_shape`, we iterate through each unit in `cell.state_size` to create the corresponding state shape.

These modifications should address the bug and ensure that the `compute_output_shape` method accurately computes the output shapes based on the RNN cell properties and the input parameters.
