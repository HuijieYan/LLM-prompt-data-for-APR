Potential error location: In the `compute_output_shape` function, the `state_shape` variable is incorrectly initialized as `state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]`. However, `self.states` is not being passed as an argument to the function, and its intended usage is unclear in this context.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `state_shape` variable is incorrectly assigned based on `self.states`, which is not defined anywhere in the function or its arguments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can modify the `state_shape` to be based on a predefined number of states rather than relying on `self.states`. Additionally, we should ensure that the received input parameters are handled correctly.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]
    
    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size
    
    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    
    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
