The error message indicates that the expected output shape is not matching the actual output shape. Specifically, at index 3, the dimensions are different, which is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location in the function is likely related to the computation of the output shape when `self.return_state` is `True` and the final `else` condition where `output_shape` is returned.

The bug is happening because the function is not properly handling the case when `self.return_state` is `True`. The function is not returning the state shape correctly, causing the mismatch in the output shapes.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly compute and return the state shape when `self.return_state` is `True`, ensuring that it aligns with the expected output shape.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In this corrected function, the state shape is properly computed using the length of `self.cell.state_size` and returned along with the output shape. This should address the mismatch in the output shape and resolve the error.
