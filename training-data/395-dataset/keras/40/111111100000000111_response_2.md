The problem with the given code is that the functions `states` and `states` with one argument are overlapping and Python does not support function overloading.

The potential error location is in the definition of the `states` function.

The bug occurred because the function `states` is defined twice with different signatures, which is not allowed in Python. 

To fix this bug, the first `states` function needs to be renamed to something else to avoid overlapping function names.

Corrected code:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
