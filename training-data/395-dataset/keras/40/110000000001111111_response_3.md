The issue in the provided function lies in the calculation of state_shape. The function is not considering the length of self.states to determine the length of state_shape.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that the length of self.states will always be the same as the length of self.cell.state_size, which may not be the case. This assumption leads to the incorrect calculation of state_shape.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the calculation of state_shape to ensure that it reflects the length of self.states accurately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this correction, the state_shape will accurately reflect the length of self.states, and the function will return the expected output for the given test case.
