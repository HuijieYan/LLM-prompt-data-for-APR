The issue occurs when the function `compute_output_shape` is trying to calculate the state shape. The calculation is incorrect because it doesn't consider the actual state sizes and only uses a predefined value of `output_dim`. This leads to the incorrect assertion in the test case for `RNN` layer's `compute_output_shape` method.

To fix this issue, the state shape should be calculated based on the actual state sizes of the RNN cell, considering both the input shape and the return state. Additionally, in the `compute_output_shape` method, the condition for checking `self.states` should be considered to compute the state_shape.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    state_sizes = self.cell.state_size if isinstance(self.cell.state_size, (list, tuple)) else [self.cell.state_size]

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], state_sizes[0])
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], state_sizes[0])

    state_shape = [(input_shape[0], size) for size in state_sizes]

    if self.return_state:
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

This corrected code accounts for the multiple state sizes, as well as the condition for checking if `self.return_state` is true.

With this correction, the test case for `compute_output_shape` should pass without any assertion errors.
