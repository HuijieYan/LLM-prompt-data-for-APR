1. The buggy function `compute_output_shape` is supposed to calculate the output shape of the RNN layer based on the input shape and other properties of the RNN. The function has conditional logic to handle different cases, including returning the output shape and state shape when `return_state` is True.

2. The error seems to be related to the calculation of `state_shape` and `output_shape` based on the input parameters and properties of the RNN.

3. The bug occurs because the `state_shape` is not being calculated correctly based on the `states` attribute of the RNN. The `states` attribute is defined as a method in the RNN class, therefore the incorrect access to `self.states` is likely the cause of the bug.

4. To fix the bug, the `states` method should be renamed or its functionality should be changed to not conflict with the `states` attribute used in the `compute_output_shape` method.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected code, `self.states` is replaced with `range(len(self.states))` to create a list of `state_shape` with the appropriate dimensions based on the number of states in the RNN.
