Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the np.squeeze function, which is squashing the size-1 batch dimension when it should not be doing so.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: When the input data has a shape of (1, num_features), the np.squeeze function is incorrectly removing the size-1 batch dimension, resulting in a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of using np.squeeze to remove the size-1 batch dimension, we can directly return the predictions without squeezing the array. This will ensure that the shape of the output matches the input data.

Corrected code:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples, )`
            Predictions.
    """
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
