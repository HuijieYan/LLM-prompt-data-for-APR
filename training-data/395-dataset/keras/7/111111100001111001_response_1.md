The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect usage of the `filter_sk_params` method. The method is being called as `Sequential.predict` instead of `self.predict`. This means that the `filter_sk_params` method is not being appropriately used to filter the parameters. 

To fix this, we need to call `self.filter_sk_params` instead of `Sequential.predict`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_7/keras/wrappers/scikit_learn.py

class KerasRegressor(BaseWrapper):
    """
    Implementation of the scikit-learn regressor API for Keras.
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)
        return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

By calling `self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)`, the method is correctly being used and the issue should be resolved.
