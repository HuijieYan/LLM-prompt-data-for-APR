The error message in the given test case indicates that the shape of the prediction result is incorrect. It is expected to be `(1,)` but it is returned as an empty tuple `()`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the prediction result is squeezed: `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`

The bug occurs because the `np.squeeze` function removes single-dimensional entries from the shape of the array, which leads to an empty tuple `()` when the input shape is `(1, num_features)`.

To fix this bug, the `np.squeeze` function should be removed and the `predict` method should return the prediction result without squeezing.

Here's the corrected version of the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

With this fix, the predicted result will be returned without being squeezed, and the shape will be maintained as expected, which resolves the bug related to squashing the size-1 batch dimension.
