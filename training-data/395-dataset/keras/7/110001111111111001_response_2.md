The error occurs in the `predict` method of the KerasRegressor class. The function is trying to access the `filter_sk_params` method with the signature `filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)`, which is not correct as `filter_sk_params` is not an attribute of the KerasRegressor class. This seems to be the root cause of the error in the test function.

To fix the bug, the `filter_sk_params` function should be called directly, without using `self` as it is not an instance method.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)  # fix: calling filter_sk_params directly
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

By directly calling the `filter_sk_params` function without using `self`, the bug will be fixed and the test function should pass without any assertion errors.
