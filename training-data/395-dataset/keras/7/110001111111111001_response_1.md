The error message indicates that the shape of the predicted values (preds) is not matching the expected shape. The expected shape is (1,) because num_test=1, but the actual shape is empty. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
```

The bug occurred because the `filter_sk_params` method is not being used correctly. The `filter_sk_params` method is intended to filter out non-sequential parameters, but it is being applied directly to the `Sequential.predict` method instead of to the function `predict` of the KerasRegressor class.

To fix the bug, the `filter_sk_params` method should be applied to the `predict` method of the KerasRegressor class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)  # Apply filter_sk_params to the predict method of the KerasRegressor
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
