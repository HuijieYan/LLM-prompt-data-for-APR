The error is occurring because the `predict` method is returning an empty tuple instead of an array with the shape `(num_test,)`.

The issue seems to be with the `np.squeeze` function in the `predict` method, which is causing the shape of the output to become an empty tuple.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `predict` method to handle the output correctly and ensure that it has the shape `(num_test,)` as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs).ravel()
```

By using the `ravel` method, we ensure that the output has the correct shape `(num_test,)`. The `np.squeeze` function is not needed in this case. This should resolve the issue and make the test case pass successfully.
