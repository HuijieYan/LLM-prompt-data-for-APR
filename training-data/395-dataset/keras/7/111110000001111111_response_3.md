The bug occurs because the `np.squeeze` function in the `predict` method is squashing the size-1 batch dimension. This means that if `predict` is called on input with shape (1, num_features), then the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. This causes issues with downstream operations that expect an array.

To fix this bug, the return statement should be modified to ensure that the output is always a 1-dimensional array with 1 element, even if the input batch size is 1.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    predictions = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if len(predictions.shape) == 1:
        return predictions.reshape(1, -1)  # Ensure a 2D array with one row
    else:
        return predictions
```

By reshaping the predictions to ensure a 2D array with one row (if the input batch size is 1), we can ensure that the output of the `predict` method always follows the expected shape and does not cause downstream errors.
