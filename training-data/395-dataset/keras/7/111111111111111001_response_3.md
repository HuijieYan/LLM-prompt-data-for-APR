The issue seems to be with the `predict` function in the `KerasRegressor` class. The error message indicates that the shape of the predictions (`preds`) is empty, which is unexpected. This is likely due to the line where `kwargs` is assigned a value using the `filter_sk_params` function. 

The problem likely arises from the line:
```python
kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
```

The `Sequential.predict` function should actually be replaced with `self.model.predict` as `Sequential.predict` is not a valid reference to the `predict` method of the `Sequential` model. This results in an AttributeError and results in preds being empty.

To fix the bug, the code within the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class should be modified as follows:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.model.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
