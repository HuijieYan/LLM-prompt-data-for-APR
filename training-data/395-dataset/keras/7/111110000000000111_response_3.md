Potential Error Location: The `np.squeeze` function call in the `predict` method is likely causing the issue by squashing the size-1 batch dimension in the output.

Reasons Behind Bug Occurrence: When `predict()` is called on input with shape (1, num_features), the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element because of the `np.squeeze` function call in the `predict` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: Remove the `np.squeeze` function call, as it is unnecessary and causing the issue. The output should not be squashed if the input has a size-1 batch dimension.

Corrected Code:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
