Potential error location: The problematic line of code is the following:
```python
kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
```

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The `filter_sk_params` method is not a standard method for filtering the `kwargs` dictionary, causing the function to fail.
2. There is no need to filter the `kwargs` dictionary in this context.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary filtering of the `kwargs` dictionary.
2. Simply pass the `kwargs` dictionary to the `predict` method without any filtering.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
