The bug occurs in the `predict` function of the class `KerasRegressor` within the `keras.wrappers.scikit_learn` module. The issue is that when `predict` is called on input with shape (1, num_features), the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

The reason for this bug is that `np.squeeze` is being used in the `predict` function, which removes single-dimensional entries from the shape of the array. This results in the output becoming a 0-dimensional array instead of preserving the batch dimension when the input shape is (1, num_features).

To fix this bug, the use of `np.squeeze` should be removed, and the shape of the output should be preserved, specifically when the input batch size is 1.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

With the above change, the `predict` function will preserve the shape of the output, ensuring that the output is a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input batch size is 1.
