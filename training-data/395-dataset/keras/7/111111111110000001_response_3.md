The bug in the provided code is likely caused by the `filter_sk_params` method not being implemented correctly, which leads to an incorrect shape of the predictions.

Potential error location: 
The line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` is likely causing the issue because it is not applying the filter correctly to the kwargs.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `filter_sk_params` method is designed to manipulate the kwargs dictionary based on certain criteria. However, it seems that the implementation of `filter_sk_params` is not correctly modifying the kwargs in a way that aligns with the expectations of the `predict` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the implementation of the `filter_sk_params` method to ensure that it correctly filters and modifies the kwargs as expected by the `predict` method.
2. Ensure that the modified kwargs result in the correct behavior and output of the `model.predict` call.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    if kwargs is not None:
        # Apply the filter to kwargs
        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    else:
        kwargs = {}
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
