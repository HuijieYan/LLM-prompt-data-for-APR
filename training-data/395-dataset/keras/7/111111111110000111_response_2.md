The error message indicates that when the `predict` method is called on input with shape `(1, num_features)`, the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

It appears that the bug is in the predict method implementation. The problem occurs when it tries to squeeze the output using `np.squeeze`, removing the singleton dimension instead of keeping it. This leads to the shape of the output array being a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `np.squeeze` function preserves dimensions when the input array has one element. We can achieve this by specifying the `axis` parameter as None in the `np.squeeze` function. This will ensure that the dimensions of the array are preserved.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs), axis=None)
```
