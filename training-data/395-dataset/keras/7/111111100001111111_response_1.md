Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` where the `filter_sk_params` method is being called with an incorrect parameter, `Sequential.predict`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `filter_sk_params` method is being called with an incorrect parameter, `Sequential.predict`. It seems that the intention was to filter the parameters for the `predict` method of the `Sequential` class, but the syntax is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The correct syntax for calling the `filter_sk_params` method with the `predict` method of the `Sequential` class should be `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)`. This will ensure that the parameters are correctly filtered for the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

With this correction, the `filter_sk_params` method will correctly filter the parameters for the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class.
