The error occurs in the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. The error message suggests that when the `predict` method is called with input of shape (1, num_features), the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

The issue lies in the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`, which is squashing the output when the input has a size-1 batch dimension.

To fix this issue, the `predict` method should return an output with a consistent shape, ensuring that the batch dimension is preserved even when it's of size 1.

Here's the corrected version of the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if preds.ndim == 1:
        return preds  # No need to squeeze
    else:
        return np.squeeze(preds)
```
