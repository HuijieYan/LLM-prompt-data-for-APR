The error message indicates that the shape of the `preds` array is empty, causing the assertion to fail. This is likely due to an issue in the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class.

The issue in the `predict` method lies in the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`. It seems that the `np.squeeze` function is causing the shape of the array to become empty.

The potential reason for this bug is that the `np.squeeze` function is removing a single-dimensional entry from the shape of the array. This might result in an empty shape if the array is only one-dimensional.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `predict` method to handle the shape correctly. We can remove the `np.squeeze` function and return the predictions directly from `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
