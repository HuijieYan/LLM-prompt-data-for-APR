The issue arises from the predict function's inappropriate reshaping of the output when the input has a size-1 batch dimension. The predict function incorrectly flattens the output into a 0-dimensional array instead of returning a 1-dimensional array with one element.

The bug likely occurs due to the np.squeeze call in the predict function that is intended to remove size-1 dimensions from the output. However, in the case of a size-1 batch dimension, this leads to incorrect flattening of the prediction array.

To fix the bug, the np.squeeze call should be modified or removed, and the check for size-1 dimensions should be handled differently.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasRegressor
from sklearn.base import BaseWrapper

# Relative function's signature in this file
def filter_sk_params(self, fn, override=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Relative function's signature in this file
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Class declaration containing the corrected function
class KerasRegressor(BaseWrapper):
    """
    Implementation of the scikit-learn regressor API for Keras.
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # Corrected function
    def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
        # Arguments

        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.model.predict, kwargs)
        return np.asarray(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
