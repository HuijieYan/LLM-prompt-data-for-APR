The error occurs when the predict() method is called on input with shape (1, num_features), and the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. This results in the shape mismatch error when trying to perform further operations with the prediction.

The potential error in the buggy function is at the line:
```python
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
The np.squeeze() function is being used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of the input. However, when the input is (1, num_features), np.squeeze() removes the single-dimensional entry, resulting in a 0-dimensional array instead of the intended 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

To fix the bug, the use of np.squeeze() needs to be revised to handle the correct reshaping of the prediction output to ensure that it matches the expected shape.

Here's the corrected code for the predict() method:

```python
# Corrected function
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    predictions = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if predictions.shape == (1, 1):
        return predictions.flatten()
    else:
        return predictions
```

In the corrected code, after obtaining the predictions from the model, a check is performed to see if the shape of the predictions is (1, 1). If so, the predictions are flattened to ensure a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. Otherwise, the predictions are returned as they are. This approach ensures that the shape of the predictions matches the expected format.
