The problem is likely in the predict function of the given code. The error message from the test function indicates that the shape of the predictions is not as expected when using the predict function.

The potential error location within the code is the line where the predictions are returned: `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`. This line might not be returning the predictions in the correct shape.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the prediction shape correctly, resulting in an incorrect shape of the predictions. This is indicated by the error message from the test function, which expects the predictions to have shape (1,) but instead gets a shape of ().

To fix the bug, the predict function should ensure that the predictions are returned in the correct shape. This can be achieved by modifying the return statement and handling the prediction shape correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the predict function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if preds.shape[1] == 1:
        return np.squeeze(preds)
    else:
        return preds
```

In this corrected code, after getting the predictions from the model, it checks the shape of the predictions. If the shape has only one dimension, it squeezes the predictions. Otherwise, it returns the predictions as they are. This modification ensures that the predictions are returned in the correct shape, addressing the bug identified in the original code.
