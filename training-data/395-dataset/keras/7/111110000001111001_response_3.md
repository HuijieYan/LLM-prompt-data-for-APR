The bug in the function seems to be related to the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)`. It appears that the intention is to filter the keyword arguments based on the signature of the `Sequential.predict` method, but the implementation is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the `Sequential.predict` method is being used as a function reference without an instantiated object of the `Sequential` class. This leads to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `predict` method of the `self.model` instance, instead of trying to reference the method from the class directly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
