The issue here is that the predict function of the KerasRegressor class inappropriately squashes the size-1 batch dimension, resulting in a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

The potential error location is the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))` which squeezes out the size-1 batch dimension.

The bug occurs because the np.squeeze() function is used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. When a size-1 batch dimension is present, np.squeeze() removes it, resulting in a 0-dimensional array.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the predict function to return an array with the expected shape.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    return preds
```
