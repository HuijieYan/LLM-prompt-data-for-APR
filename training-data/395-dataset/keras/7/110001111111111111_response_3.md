The `predict` function is currently squashing the size-1 batch dimension when called on input with shape `(1, num_features)`. This is causing the output to be a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

The issue is occurring in the `predict` function when `np.squeeze` is used to remove the size-1 batch dimension, resulting in an incorrect output shape.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `predict` function to return the predictions with the correct shape, including the size-1 batch dimension.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_outputs)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
