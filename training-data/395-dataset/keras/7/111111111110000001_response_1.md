The error message is indicating a failure in the assertion that the shape of the predicted value 'preds' is equal to (1,). The bug seems to be in the predict method of the KerasRegressor class, where the shape of 'preds' is not being properly handled.

The potential error in the predict method is that the line 'kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)' is causing the issue. This line is likely intended to filter and pass appropriate keyword arguments to the 'model.predict' method, but it seems to be missing an instance of 'self'. As a result, 'Sequential.predict' is being used directly without the necessary context.

To fix the bug, the 'filter_sk_params' method should be called using 'self' as the instance, and the result should be used as the filtered keyword arguments.

Corrected code:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    filtered_kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **filtered_kwargs))
```
