The bug seems to be occurring in the `predict()` method of a class `KerasRegressor` which takes an input `x` and keyword arguments `kwargs`. The issue seems to be related to the shape of the predictions being returned.

The `predict()` method currently uses `np.squeeze` to remove axes of length 1, however, this behavior is not suitable for the specific use case highlighted in the test case. Since the `predict()` method of the `KerasRegressor` is returning an output with an incorrect shape, the assertion in the test case fails.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `predict()` method to return an output with the desired shape, based on the input's shape. Instead of using `np.squeeze`, we need to ensure that the shape of the output is adjusted as per the input and in the case where the output shape is `(1,)`, it should be returned as a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

Below is the corrected code for the `predict()` method:

```python
# Corrected predict() method
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
