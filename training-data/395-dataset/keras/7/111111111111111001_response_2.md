The error is occurring because the function `predict` should return a 1D array of predictions, but it is currently returning an empty tuple.

The issue in the code is with the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`. The `np.squeeze` function may be causing the output to become an empty tuple when the input has the correct shape.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `np.squeeze` part and directly return the predictions from `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
