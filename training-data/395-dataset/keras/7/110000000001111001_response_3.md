The bug in the given function is that it is trying to access the `Sequential.predict` method directly, which is causing an error. 

To fix this, we need to remove the `Sequential.predict` and just pass the kwargs directly to `self.model.predict` method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
