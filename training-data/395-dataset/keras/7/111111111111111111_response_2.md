The bug is likely occurring in the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. The returned value of `np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))` is expected to have the shape `(n_samples,)` but is instead returning a 0-dimensional array for shape `(1,)`. This is causing the assertion error in the test case `assert_regression_predict_shape_correct`.

One possible reason for this bug is that the `np.squeeze` function is squashing the size-1 batch dimension when it should be preserving it. This could be due to incorrect use of `np.squeeze` or incorrect assumptions about the shape of the input `x`.

To fix this bug, the `np.squeeze` function should be replaced with a different method to ensure that the size-1 batch dimension is preserved. One way to do this is to use indexing to access the first element of the array, effectively removing the size-1 batch dimension.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)[:,0]  # Access the first element to remove size-1 batch dimension
```

With this correction, the `np.squeeze` function has been replaced with indexing to access the first element of the output array, which will ensure that the size-1 batch dimension is preserved.
