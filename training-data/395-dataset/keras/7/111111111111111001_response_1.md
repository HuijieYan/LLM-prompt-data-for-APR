The error message from the test function suggests that the shape of the predictions (`preds`) is an empty tuple, which is causing the assertion error. This implies that the prediction function is not returning the expected shape.

The potential error location within the function is the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`, where the prediction is being returned. 

The bug occurs because the `kwargs` is not being used properly to handle the `batch_size` argument. In the buggy code, the `kwargs` dictionary is being re-assigned the filtered arguments, but this will not override the initial `batch_size` value. 

To fix the bug, the `batch_size` value in `kwargs` should be replaced with the value passed as an argument to the `predict` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    if 'batch_size' in kwargs:
        batch_size = kwargs.pop('batch_size')
    else:
        batch_size = 32  # Default batch size
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, batch_size=batch_size, **kwargs))
``` 

In the corrected code, the `pop` method is used to retrieve the `batch_size` value from `kwargs` if present, and it is then used as an argument when calling `self.model.predict`. If it's not present, a default `batch_size` of 32 is used. This ensures that the `batch_size` value is properly handled and the predictions have the correct shape.
