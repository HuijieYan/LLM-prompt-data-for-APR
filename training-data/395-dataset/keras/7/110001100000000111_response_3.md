The issue is related to the `predict` method in the `KerasRegressor` class from `keras.wrappers.scikit_learn` module. The bug causes the output to be a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input shape is (1, num_features).

The potential error location is within the `predict` method, particularly in the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`.

The bug occurs because the `np.squeeze` function is removing the singleton dimension (i.e., the batch dimension) from the output, resulting in a 0-dimensional array instead of the expected 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `predict` method to ensure that the singleton dimension is retained in the output array.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if preds.shape[1] == 1:
        preds = np.squeeze(preds, axis=1)
    return preds
```

In the corrected code, we first obtain the predictions from `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`. Then, we check if the shape of the predictions array has a singleton dimension. If it does, we use `np.squeeze` to remove the singleton dimension only along axis 1, ensuring that the singleton dimension of the predictions is retained. This modification will fix the bug and ensure that the output has the correct shape.
