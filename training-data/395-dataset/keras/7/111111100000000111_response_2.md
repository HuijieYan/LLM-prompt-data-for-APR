The issue seems to be with the predict() method of the KerasRegressor class. When called with input of shape (1, num_features), the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. This leads to a TypeError when using the sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error method.

The potential error location within the predict() method is in the line:

```
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

The bug occurs because np.squeeze() is removing the size-1 batch dimension, causing the output to be a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

One way to fix the bug is to add a check for the shape of the input before applying np.squeeze(). If the input has a shape of (1, num_features), then np.squeeze() should not be applied.

Here's the corrected code for the predict() method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)

    # Check the shape of the input
    if x.shape[0] == 1:
        return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    else:
        return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

This modification ensures that the size-1 batch dimension is not squashed in the case where the input has a shape of (1, num_features).
