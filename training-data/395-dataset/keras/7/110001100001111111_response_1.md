The bug occurs in the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. The bug causes the method to return a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when `predict()` is called on input with shape (1, num_features).

Upon analysis, it is clear that the bug occurs in the following line:
```python
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `np.squeeze()` is being called to remove size-1 dimensions from the input array `x`. As a result, if the input shape is (1, num_features), `np.squeeze()` removes the size-1 batch dimension and returns a 0-dimensional array.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `predict` method to correctly handle the size-1 batch dimension and ensure that it returns a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input has shape (1, num_features).

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    predictions = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if isinstance(predictions, np.ndarray) and predictions.ndim == 2 and predictions.shape[0] == 1:
        # If the predictions have shape (1, n_features), return a 1-dimensional array with 1 element
        return predictions.flatten()
    else:
        return predictions
```

With this modification, the `predict` method checks if the shape of the predictions is (1, n_features) and if so, it flattens the array to return a 1-dimensional array with 1 element, ensuring that the correct output shape is returned.
