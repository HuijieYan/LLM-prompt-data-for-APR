The bug is occurring in the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. The code is trying to call `self.filter_sk_params` with the sequential model's `predict` method, but it is not properly referring to it. Additionally, the code is using `np.squeeze` without importing the `numpy` package.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `predict` method to properly refer to the Sequential model's `predict` method and import the `numpy` package for using `np.squeeze`.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
import numpy as np

class KerasRegressor(BaseWrapper):
    """
    Implementation of the scikit-learn regressor API for Keras.
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        filtered_kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.model.predict, kwargs)
        return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **filtered_kwargs))
```

In this corrected code, we first import `numpy` as `np`. Then, we fix the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` by changing it to `filtered_kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.model.predict, kwargs)` to properly refer to the `predict` method of the Sequential model.

These changes should fix the bug and the function should work as expected.
