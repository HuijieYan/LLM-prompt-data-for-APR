The bug occurs in the predict function of the KerasRegressor class. It occurs because the np.squeeze function is used, which removes axes that have only one element. This results in the array shape being squashed when it should not be.

To fix the bug, the np.squeeze function should be removed and the return statement should be updated to return the model's predictions without squashing the array shape.

Here's the corrected code for the predict function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
        return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
