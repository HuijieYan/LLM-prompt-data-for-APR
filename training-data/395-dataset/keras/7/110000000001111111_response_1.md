The bug in the provided predict() function is likely due to the np.squeeze() function call, which is squashing size-1 batch dimension. This is causing the output to be a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. The predict() function is not handling single samples correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the np.squeeze() function call and also extract kwargs before applying Sequential.predict to ensure that the correct prediction output is returned.

Below is the corrected code for the predict() function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

By removing the np.squeeze() function, the predict() function will correctly handle single samples, and the output will have the shape `(1,)`, as expected.
