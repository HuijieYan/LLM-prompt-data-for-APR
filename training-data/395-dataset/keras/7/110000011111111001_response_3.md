The error message indicates that the shape of the predictions (preds) is not matching the expected shape. It is expected to have a shape of (1,) but it is currently empty. This indicates that the `predict` method is not returning the correct shape or values.

The issue in the code lies in the usage of `np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`. The `np.squeeze` function is used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array, but in this case, it seems to be removing all dimensions, resulting in an empty array.

The issue may be occurring because the `predict` method is not returning an array with the expected shape. Potential approaches to resolve this issue include:
1. Removing the `np.squeeze` function and directly returning the result of `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`.
2. Ensure that the `predict` method of the model returns an array with the correct shape.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
