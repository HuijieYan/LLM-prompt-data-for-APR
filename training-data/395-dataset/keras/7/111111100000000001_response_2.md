The potential error in the provided code is that the `filter_sk_params` function is being called incorrectly. The `filter_sk_params` function is being called with `Sequential.predict` as the first argument, which is incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the `filter_sk_params` function expects the first argument to be a function within the class, not the `Sequential.predict` function.

To fix the bug, the `filter_sk_params` function should be called with the `fn` argument pointing to the specific function within the class that needs to be filtered.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_7/keras/wrappers/scikit_learn.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def filter_sk_params(self, fn, override=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the corrected function

    def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
