The potential error location within the problematic function is the `np.squeeze()` function call. This call is causing the output to be a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element, as observed in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `np.squeeze()` function is removing the size-1 batch dimension from the prediction output. This is causing the output to lose its intended shape, leading to the error.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the `np.squeeze()` call and directly return the output of `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
