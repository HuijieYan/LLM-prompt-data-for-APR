The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`. The bug occurs because the `np.squeeze` function is squashing the size-1 batch dimension.

The `np.squeeze` function is used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. In this case, it is removing the single-dimensional entry which results in the shape becoming `()` instead of `(1,)`.

To fix this bug, we can remove the `np.squeeze` function and directly return the prediction from the model. This will preserve the shape of the output and solve the issue of the shape becoming `()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
