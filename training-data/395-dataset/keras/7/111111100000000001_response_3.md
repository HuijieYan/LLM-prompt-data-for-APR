The potential error in the provided code is the improper usage of the filter_sk_params() function. The filter_sk_params() function is being called with parameters "Sequential.predict" and "kwargs", which is incorrect.

The bug occurred because the filter_sk_params() function expects a function and a list of parameters to filter, but in the provided code, it is being called with "Sequential.predict" which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the filter_sk_params() function should be called with the "predict" function and the "kwargs" parameter, as that is the intended usage.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
