The bug is caused by the `predict` method returning a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when called on input with shape `(1, num_features)`.

The bug is located in the `predict` method, specifically in the line where it returns the predictions. The bug occurs because `np.squeeze` is used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array, but this causes an issue when the input has shape `(1, num_features)` as it results in a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `predict` method to handle the case where the input has shape `(1, num_features)` by reshaping the predictions to have a shape of `(1,)` instead of using `np.squeeze`.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    predictions = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    return predictions.reshape(-1) if predictions.shape[0] == 1 else predictions
```

With this modification, the bug should be fixed and the `predict` method should now correctly return a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when called on input with shape `(1, num_features)`.
