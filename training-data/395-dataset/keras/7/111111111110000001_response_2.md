1. The test case `test_regression_predict_shape_correct_num_test_1` is attempting to assert that the shape of the predictions `preds` made by the `KerasRegressor` model matches the shape `(num_test,)`. However, it is failing because the shape of `preds` is not equal to `(1,)`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `filter_sk_params` function call. It seems that the `filter_sk_params` function is not properly filtering the parameters passed to `Sequential.predict`.

3. The bug is occurring because the `filter_sk_params` function is not correctly handling the parameters passed to `Sequential.predict`, leading to an incorrect prediction shape and causing the test case to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `filter_sk_params` function correctly filters the parameters and passes them to `Sequential.predict` without altering their values.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    if kwargs is not None and 'batch_size' in kwargs:
        kwargs = {'batch_size': kwargs['batch_size']}
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the `filter_sk_params` call and explicitly filtered the `batch_size` parameter from the `kwargs` dictionary. This should ensure that only the relevant parameters are passed to `Sequential.predict` without altering their values.
