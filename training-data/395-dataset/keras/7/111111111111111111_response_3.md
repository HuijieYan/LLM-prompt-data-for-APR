The bug is likely located in the predict function of the KerasRegressor class. The error message indicates that the shape of the predictions is incorrect when the predict function is called with input of shape (1, num_features).

This bug occurs because the predict function attempts to squeeze the output of self.model.predict(x, **kwargs), which results in removing the singleton dimension, leading to an empty shape when the input has shape (1, num_features).

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to avoid squeezing the output when it has a singleton dimension.

The corrected code for the predict function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if preds.shape[0] == 1:
        preds = np.squeeze(preds, axis=0)
    return preds
```
