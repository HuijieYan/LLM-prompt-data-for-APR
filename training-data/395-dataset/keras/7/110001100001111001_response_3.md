Potential Error:
The line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` is causing the error because `Sequential.predict` is being used without proper reference to the `Sequential` class.

Reason for the Bug:
The `filter_sk_params` function is being called with the `Sequential.predict` method as an argument, but it should be called with the `predict` method of the current class (`self.predict`).

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Change `Sequential.predict` to `self.predict` in the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)  # corrected line
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
