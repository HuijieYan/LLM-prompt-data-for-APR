Based on the given input parameter values and types, and the expected variable values and types, it seems that the TensorBoard `set_model` method is not functioning as expected. The issue might be arising from the section of code where histograms, gradients, and images are being processed for visualization in TensorBoard.

The error message "AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'summary'" suggests that the module 'tensorflow' does not have the attribute 'summary'. This might be due to a version mismatch or incorrect usage of the 'tensorflow' module.

To fix this issue, the following approach can be suggested:
1. Check the compatibility between the TensorFlow version and the Keras version being used. It's important to ensure that the versions of TensorFlow and Keras are compatible with each other.
2. Review the usage of the 'tf.summary' functions within the method. Make sure that the correct API and function calls are being made for the intended functionality.
3. Ensure that the TensorFlow version being used has support for the functionalities being used within the 'TensorBoard' class. Certain functionalities might have been deprecated or changed in newer versions of TensorFlow, leading to issues.
4. Verify that the necessary TensorFlow libraries are imported at the beginning of the file, and that the required functionalities are accessible within the current scope.

Here's the corrected function code based on the given input and expected variable values:

```python
def set_model(self, model):
    self.model = model
    self.sess = K.get_session()
    if self.histogram_freq > 0 and self.merged is None:
        for layer in self.model.layers:
            for weight in layer.weights:
                mapped_weight_name = weight.name.replace(':', '_')
                tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram(mapped_weight_name, weight)
                if self.write_grads:
                    grads = K.gradients(model.total_loss, weight)
                    for grad in grads:
                        if isinstance(grad, tf.IndexedSlices):
                            grad_values = grad.values
                        else:
                            grad_values = grad
                        tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram('{}_grad'.format(mapped_weight_name), grad_values)
                if self.write_images:
                    w_img = tf.transpose(weight)
                    w_img = tf.reshape(w_img, [1, -1])
                    tf.compat.v1.summary.image(mapped_weight_name, w_img)

        if hasattr(layer, 'output'):
            tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram('{}_out'.format(layer.name), layer.output)

    self.merged = tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all()

    self.writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter(self.log_dir)
    if self.write_graph:
        self.writer.add_graph(self.sess.graph)

    if self.embeddings_freq:
        embeddings_layer_names = self.embeddings_layer_names
        if not embeddings_layer_names:
            embeddings_layer_names = [layer.name for layer in self.model.layers if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Embedding)]
        embeddings = {layer.name: layer.weights[0] for layer in self.model.layers if layer.name in embeddings_layer_names}
        saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(list(embeddings.values()))
        embeddings_metadata = {}

        for layer_name, tensor in embeddings.items():
            embedding = config.embeddings.add()
            embedding.tensor_name = tensor.name
            if layer_name in embeddings_metadata:
                embedding.metadata_path = embeddings_metadata[layer_name]

        self.saver = saver
        projector.visualize_embeddings(self.writer, config)
```

This corrected code uses `tf.compat.v1.summary` and `tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter` to ensure compatibility with the TensorFlow version being used. It also addresses some of the potential issues observed in the original code.
