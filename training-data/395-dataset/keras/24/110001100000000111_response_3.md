The potential error in the given code is that the indentation of the function `is_indexed_slices` is incorrect. It is currently indented inside the `set_model` method, which is not the intended structure.

The reason for the bug is the misplacement of the `is_indexed_slices` function. It should be at the same level of indentation as the `set_model` method as it is a separate helper function.

To fix this bug, the `is_indexed_slices` function should be unindented to be at the same level as the `set_model` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_24/keras/callbacks.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def is_indexed_slices(grad):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def set_model(self, model):
    self.model = model
    if K.backend() == 'tensorflow':
        self.sess = K.get_session()
    if self.histogram_freq and self.merged is None:
        for layer in self.model.layers:
            for weight in layer.weights:
                mapped_weight_name = weight.name.replace(':', '_')
                tf.summary.histogram(mapped_weight_name, weight)
                if self.write_grads:
                    grads = model.optimizer.get_gradients(model.total_loss, weight)

                    grads = [
                        grad.values if is_indexed_slices(grad) else grad
                        for grad in grads]
                    tf.summary.histogram('{}_grad'.format(mapped_weight_name), grads)
                if self.write_images:
                    w_img = tf.squeeze(weight)
                    shape = K.int_shape(w_img)
                    if len(shape) == 2:  # dense layer kernel case
                        if shape[0] > shape[1]:
                            w_img = tf.transpose(w_img)
                            shape = K.int_shape(w_img)
                        w_img = tf.reshape(w_img, [1, shape[0], shape[1], 1])
                    # ... (omitted some code for brevity) ...
    self.merged = tf.summary.merge_all()

    if self.write_graph:
        self.writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(self.log_dir, self.sess.graph)
    else:
        self.writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(self.log_dir)

    # ... (omitted the remainder of the function as it is not relevant to the fix)
