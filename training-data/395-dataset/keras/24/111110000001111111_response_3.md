The error occurs in the set_model function of the TensorBoard class, where it is expected to set the model and perform some operations related to TensorBoard. The major issue in the function is that it lacks proper TensorFlow operations related to histograms and visualizations.

The bug is primarily due to the incorrect usage of TensorFlow operations and graph management. The function should handle histogram visualization and graph visualization more carefully. Additionally, there is a lack of proper conditional checks for the write_grads and write_images flags.

To fix the bug:
1. Understand the requirements for histogram, graph, and image visualizations in TensorBoard.
2. Ensure that TensorFlow operations for histograms and visualizations are used correctly.
3. Include conditional checks for the write_grads and write_images flags to control the visualization process effectively.

The corrected code for the set_model function is provided below:

```python
def set_model(self, model):
    self.model = model
    if K.backend() == 'tensorflow':
        self.sess = K.get_session()
    if self.histogram_freq and self.merged is None:
        for layer in self.model.layers:
            for weight in layer.weights:
                mapped_weight_name = weight.name.replace(':', '_')
                tf.summary.histogram(mapped_weight_name, weight)
                if self.write_grads:
                    grads = K.gradients(model.total_loss, weight)[0]
                    tf.summary.histogram('{}_grad'.format(mapped_weight_name), grads)
                if self.write_images:
                    w_img = tf.reshape(weight, [-1, weight.shape.as_list()[-1], 1, 1])
                    tf.summary.image(mapped_weight_name, w_img)

            if hasattr(layer, 'output'):
                tf.summary.histogram('{}_out'.format(layer.name), layer.output)

    self.merged = tf.summary.merge_all()

    if self.write_graph:
        self.writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(self.log_dir, self.sess.graph)
    else:
        self.writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(self.log_dir)

    if self.embeddings_freq:
        embeddings_layer_names = self.embeddings_layer_names

        if not embeddings_layer_names:
            embeddings_layer_names = [layer.name for layer in self.model.layers if isinstance(layer, Embedding)]

        embeddings = {layer.name: layer.weights
                      for layer in self.model.layers
                      if layer.name in embeddings_layer_names}

        self.saver = tf.train.Saver(list(embeddings.values()))

        embeddings_metadata = {}
        if isinstance(self.embeddings_metadata, str):
            embeddings_metadata = {layer.name: self.embeddings_metadata
                                   for layer in embeddings_layer_names}

        config = projector.ProjectorConfig()
        self.embeddings_ckpt_path = os.path.join(self.log_dir, 'keras_embedding.ckpt')

        for layer_name, tensor in embeddings.items():
            embedding = config.embeddings.add()
            embedding.tensor_name = tensor.name
            if layer_name in embeddings_metadata:
                embedding.metadata_path = embeddings_metadata[layer_name]

        projector.visualize_embeddings(self.writer, config)
```

In the corrected code:
- The TensorFlow operations for histograms, gradients, and images have been used according to their intended functionality.
- Conditional checks and proper tensor reshaping have been included for write_grads and write_images flags.
- Proper usage of K.gradients instead of model.optimizer.get_gradients for gradients computation.

These corrections should address the issues and ensure that the TensorBoard visualization functions operate as expected.
