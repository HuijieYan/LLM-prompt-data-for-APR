The error message in the test function indicates that the location where the files are being saved is incorrect when the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable is not set to `~/.keras`. This suggests that the `cache_dir` parameter in the `get_file` function is not being handled properly when the value is `None`.

The potential error location within the function is the handling of the `cache_dir` parameter and the default condition when it is `None`.

A possible reason for the bug is that the `cache_dir` parameter defaulting to `~/.keras` is not consistent with the environment variable `KERAS_HOME`. When `KERAS_HOME` is set, the files should be saved in the specified directory rather than the default `~/.keras`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_file` function to check for the existence of the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable and use it as the default `cache_dir` if it is set. If `KERAS_HOME` is not set, then the function should fall back to using `~/.keras`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it's not already in the cache.
    
    ... [function documentation continues]

    # Returns
        Path to the downloaded file
    """  # noqa
    
    keras_home = os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME')
    if keras_home and cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = keras_home
    elif cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
    
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    # (rest of the function code)
```

In this corrected function, we check if the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable is set and use it as the default value for `cache_dir`. If `KERAS_HOME` is not set, we default to using `~/.keras`. This change ensures that the files are saved in the correct directory based on the environment variable `KERAS_HOME`.
