The error message indicates that the test fails because the assert statement comparing the `data_keras_home` with the directory path stored in `K._config_path` fails.

The potential error location within the `get_file` function is likely in the block where the `cache_dir` is being set as the default value. This default value behavior is likely causing the inconsistency when `KERAS_HOME` is set to a directory other than `~/.keras`.

The reason behind the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `KERAS_HOME` is set to a different location than the default `~/.keras`. This results in the models and datasets being stored in `~/.keras` even when `KERAS_HOME` is set.

To fix the bug, the `cache_dir` should be set to the value of `KERAS_HOME` if it exists, and to the default `~/.keras` if not.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser(os.environ['KERAS_HOME']), '.keras')
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
    
    # remaining code for the function...
```

By setting `cache_dir` to the value of `KERAS_HOME` if it exists or to the default `~/.keras` if not, this should ensure that the models, datasets, and config file are all stored in the same folder when `KERAS_HOME` is specified.
