The bug in the provided code occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the conditional statements and the download process inside the `get_file` function. The code does not correctly handle the `untar` and `extract` parameters, and it uses variables that are not defined or casted appropriately.

The major issue seems to be the conditional logic associated with the `download` variable. At different points in the code, the function sets `download` to `False` and `True` without a clear and consistent path. Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the `untar` and `extract` parameters for files that need to be extracted or decompressed.

To fix this bug, the developer should ensure that the conditional logic for the `download` variable is consistent and consider refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability. Additionally, the function should appropriately handle the `untar` and `extract` parameters to determine if the file needs to be decompressed or extracted.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
import os
from urllib import error as urlerror
from urllib import request as urlreq
from urllib.error import URLError, HTTPError
import tarfile
import zipfile


def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
    if md5_hash is not None and file_hash is None:
        file_hash = md5_hash
        hash_algorithm = 'md5'
    datadir_base = os.path.expanduser(cache_dir)
    if not os.access(datadir_base, os.W_OK):
        datadir_base = os.path.join('/tmp', '.keras')
    datadir = os.path.join(datadir_base, cache_subdir)
    os.makedirs(datadir, exist_ok=True)

    if untar:
        untar_fpath = os.path.join(datadir, fname)
        fpath = untar_fpath + '.tar.gz'
    else:
        fpath = os.path.join(datadir, fname)

    if os.path.exists(fpath) and file_hash is not None:
        if not validate_file(fpath, file_hash, algorithm=hash_algorithm):
            print('A local file was found, but it seems to be incomplete or outdated because the ' + hash_algorithm +
                  ' file hash does not match the original value of ' +
                  file_hash + ' so we will re-download the data.')
            download = True
    else:
        download = True

    if download:
        print('Downloading data from', origin)

        try:
            urlreq.urlretrieve(origin, fpath)
        except (HTTPError, URLError) as e:
            raise Exception('URL fetch failure on {} : {} -- {}'.format(origin, e.errno if hasattr(e, 'errno') else e.code,
                                                                       e.reason if hasattr(e, 'reason') else e.msg))

    if untar:
        if not os.path.exists(untar_fpath):
            with tarfile.open(fpath, 'r:gz') as tar:
                tar.extractall(path=datadir)
        return untar_fpath

    if extract:
        if archive_format == 'tar':
            with tarfile.open(fpath, 'r') as tar:
                tar.extractall(path=datadir)
        elif archive_format == 'zip':
            with zipfile.ZipFile(fpath, 'r') as zip_ref:
                zip_ref.extractall(datadir)
    
    return fpath
```

In the corrected code, the inconsistent conditional statements for the `download` variable are removed, and the logic for handling the extraction process is adjusted based on the `untar` and `extract` parameters. Additionally, the download process is simplified to use `urlreq.urlretrieve` for downloading the file.
