The potential error location within the problematic function is the default value for the `cache_dir` parameter. When `cache_dir` is not provided, the function sets it to `None` and then later assigns it to `~/.keras`. This is inconsistent with the Keras backend when `KERAS_HOME` is not `~/.keras`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the default value for `cache_dir` does not take into account different settings for `KERAS_HOME`, resulting in models and datasets being saved in the default location, even when `KERAS_HOME` is set to a different directory.

To fix the bug, the default value for `cache_dir` should be updated to consider the value of `KERAS_HOME`. If `KERAS_HOME` is not set, then the default location should be `~/.keras`. If `KERAS_HOME` is set, then the cache directory should be located within `KERAS_HOME`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.environ['KERAS_HOME']
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

By setting the `cache_dir` based on the value of `KERAS_HOME` environment variable, the function will be consistent with the Keras backend and models/datasets will be saved in the correct location based on the environment settings.
