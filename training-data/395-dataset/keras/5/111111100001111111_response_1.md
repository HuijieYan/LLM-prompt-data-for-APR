The bug is likely located in the default value of the `cache_dir` parameter in the `get_file` function. The default value is set to `None`, but it should be set to `'~/.keras'` to align with the behavior of the Keras backend when `KERAS_HOME` is not set explicitly.

The bug is occurring because the `cache_dir` is not being properly set in cases where the default value is used.

To fix the bug, the default value for `cache_dir` should be set to `os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')` to ensure that the cache directory aligns with the Keras backend.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file` function:
```python
def get_file(
        fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None,
        cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto',
        extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.

    By default the file at the url `origin` is downloaded to the
    cache_dir `~/.keras`, placed in the cache_subdir `datasets`,
    and given the filename `fname`. The final location of a file
    `example.txt` would therefore be `~/.keras/datasets/example.txt`.

    ... (other function documentation)

    """

    # (remaining function code)
```

By setting the default value of `cache_dir` correctly, the function should behave consistently with the Keras backend even when `KERAS_HOME` is not explicitly set to `~/.keras`.
