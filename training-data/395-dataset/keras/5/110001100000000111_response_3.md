The error in the code seems to be related to the default value of the `cache_dir` parameter in the `get_file()` function. It's mentioned that when `KERAS_HOME` is not set to `~/.keras`, the models and datasets will still be in `~/.keras` because the default value of `cache_dir` is not taking into account the `KERAS_HOME` location. 

The bug fix should involve updating the default value of `cache_dir` to use the `KERAS_HOME` location if it is set, rather than defaulting to `~/.keras` every time.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable is set, and if it is, use that as the base directory for the cache instead of `~/.keras`. If it's not set, then fallback to using `~/.keras`. 

Here is the corrected code for the `get_file()` function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME', os.path.expanduser('~/.keras')))
    if md5_hash is not None and file_hash is None:
        file_hash = md5_hash
        hash_algorithm = 'md5'
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This corrected code takes into account the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable when setting the `cache_dir`, using its value if it is set, or falling back to `~/.keras` if not.
