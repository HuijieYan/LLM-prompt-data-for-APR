The potential error location within the problematic function is the default value assignment for the `cache_dir` parameter. The function defaults to `~/.keras` if `cache_dir` is not specified, which causes inconsistency with the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable.

The bug is occurring because the function does not consider the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable when setting the default cache directory. This results in models and datasets being stored in `~/.keras` instead of in the folder specified by `KERAS_HOME`.

To fix the bug, the function should take the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable into account when setting the default cache directory. If `KERAS_HOME` is set, the function should use it as the default cache directory. Otherwise, it should default to `~/.keras`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.
    ... (function documentation remains the same)

    # Returns
        Path to the downloaded file
    """  # noqa

    keras_home = os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME')
    if keras_home is not None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(keras_home, cache_subdir)
    else:
        if cache_dir is None:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

    return fpath
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable is set. If it is set, we use it to construct the default cache directory. If not, we fall back to the original logic of using `~/.keras` as the default cache directory. This change ensures that the function is consistent with the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable and stores models and datasets in the appropriate location.
