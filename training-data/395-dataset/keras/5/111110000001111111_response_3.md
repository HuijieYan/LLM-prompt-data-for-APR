The bug is likely located in the default setting of the cache directory. It seems that if the cache_dir is not provided, the function improperly defaults to `~/.keras` instead of the provided `KERAS_HOME`. This results in inconsistent behavior when `KERAS_HOME` is not at the default location.

To fix this bug, the function should default to the value of `KERAS_HOME` if it is set, and only default to `~/.keras` if `KERAS_HOME` is not set.

Potential approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the environment variable `KERAS_HOME` is set.
2. If it is set, use the value of `KERAS_HOME` as the cache directory.
3. If `KERAS_HOME` is not set, then use `~/.keras` as the default cache directory.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it is not already in the cache."""

    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME', os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras'))

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By checking for the environment variable `KERAS_HOME`, the function will now properly default to the value of `KERAS_HOME` if it is set, ensuring consistent behavior irrespective of the location of the `KERAS_HOME` directory.
