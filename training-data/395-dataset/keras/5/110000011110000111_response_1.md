The error message indicates that there is inconsistency between the default cache directory and the KERAS_HOME directory when KERAS_HOME is not set to ~/.keras.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the assignment of the cache_dir variable. When cache_dir is None, it defaults to ~/.keras, which leads to the inconsistency when KERAS_HOME is not set to that location.

The bug occurred because the function was not handling the case where KERAS_HOME is set to a directory other than ~/.keras. This led to the default cache directory being different from KERAS_HOME, causing the inconsistency.

To fix the bug, we need to update the get_file() function to use the KERAS_HOME directory as the default cache directory when it is set, and fall back to ~/.keras only when KERAS_HOME is not set.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.

    By default the file at the url `origin` is downloaded to the
    cache_dir `~/.keras`, placed in the cache_subdir `datasets`,
    and given the filename `fname`. The final location of a file
    `example.txt` would therefore be `~/.keras/datasets/example.txt`.

    ...

    # Returns
        Path to the downloaded file
    """  # noqa
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.environ['KERAS_HOME']
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

With this change, the function will first check if KERAS_HOME is set and use that as the cache directory. If not, it will default to ~/.keras as before. This ensures that the default cache directory is consistent with KERAS_HOME and resolves the inconsistency issue.
