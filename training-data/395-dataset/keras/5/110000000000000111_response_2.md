The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the cache_dir variable. It is set to the default value of `os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')` if it is None, which may cause inconsistency with the KERAS_HOME environment variable.

The bug occurs because the cache_dir is set to the default value of ~/.keras, regardless of the KERAS_HOME environment variable. This leads to models and datasets being stored in ~/.keras even when KERAS_HOME is set to a different location.

To fix the bug, we need to update the initialization of cache_dir to take the KERAS_HOME environment variable into account. If the environment variable is set, then cache_dir should be set to that location, otherwise, it should fall back to the default value of ~/.keras. Additionally, existing unit tests need to be updated to accommodate the changes in the cache_dir location.

The corrected code for the problematic function will be as follows:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.
    
    ... (rest of the documentation remains the same)

    # Returns
        Path to the downloaded file
    """  # noqa

    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME', os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras'))

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
By updating the initialization of cache_dir to consider the KERAS_HOME environment variable, we ensure that the function respects the environment variable and stores the files in the correct location.
