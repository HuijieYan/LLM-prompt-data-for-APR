Error location:
The issue with the buggy function arises from the default value of the `cache_dir` parameter. The default directory is set to `~/.keras`, which causes inconsistencies when a custom path is defined using the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function `get_file` does not handle the case where a custom path is defined using the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable. This results in the files being saved to the default directory `~/.keras` even when a custom path is specified.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function `get_file` should check for the existence of the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable and use it as the default directory if it is defined. If `KERAS_HOME` is not defined, then the function should default to `~/.keras`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.

    By default, the file at the URL `origin` is downloaded to the cache_dir `~/.keras`, placed in the cache_subdir `datasets`, and given the filename `fname`. The final location of a file `example.txt` would therefore be `~/.keras/datasets/example.txt`.

    Files in tar, tar.gz, tar.bz, and zip formats can also be extracted. Passing a hash will verify the file after download. The command line programs `shasum` and `sha256sum` can compute the hash.
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...

    """
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.path.expanduser(os.environ['KERAS_HOME'])
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
    # Rest of the code remains the same...
    # ...
```

The changes made include checking for the existence of the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable and using it as the default directory if it is defined. If `KERAS_HOME` is not defined, then the function defaults to `~/.keras`. These changes ensure that the function is consistent with the Keras backend even when a custom path is defined using the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable.
