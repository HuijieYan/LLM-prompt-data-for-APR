The error message indicates that the assertion for the variable `data_keras_home` fails. The reason for this is that the default `cache_dir` for the `get_file` function is not consistent with the `KERAS_HOME` location when it is set to a value other than `~/.keras`.

The bug occurs because the `cache_dir` is hardcoded to `~/.keras` when `cache_dir` is not provided. This causes the files to be saved in `~/.keras` regardless of the `KERAS_HOME` location.

To fix the bug, the `cache_dir` should default to `KERAS_HOME` when it is set, and default to `~/.keras` only when `KERAS_HOME` is not set.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.environ['KERAS_HOME']
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

By updating the `cache_dir` based on the presence of `KERAS_HOME`, the bug is resolved. This change ensures that the files are saved in the correct location based on the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable.

After making this change, the unit test `test_data_utils` should pass without any assertion errors, and the default location for the cache directory will align with the `KERAS_HOME` setting.
