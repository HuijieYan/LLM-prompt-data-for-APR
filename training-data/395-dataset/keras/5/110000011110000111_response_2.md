The test case is trying to download a file from a URL, extract it, and validate it. The error occurs when the test case tries to assert the location of the file with the KERAS_HOME directory. The actual location and the expected location do not match, causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the function is the default value for the cache_dir parameter. When not provided, the cache_dir is set to `~/.keras`, which may not be consistent with the KERAS_HOME directory set by the test case.

The bug occurs because the default value for cache_dir is set to `~/.keras`, but the KERAS_HOME directory is set to a different location in the test case. This inconsistency leads to files and directories being created in different locations than expected, causing the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the default cache_dir should be consistent with the KERAS_HOME directory. This can be achieved by setting the default cache_dir to the KERAS_HOME directory if it is provided, and falling back to `~/.keras` only if KERAS_HOME is not set.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.
    
    ... (rest of the docstring)
    """
    keras_home = os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME', os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras'))
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = keras_home
    if md5_hash is not None and file_hash is None:
        file_hash = md5_hash
        hash_algorithm = 'md5'
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected code, the cache_dir is set to the KERAS_HOME directory if it is provided, and falls back to `~/.keras` only if KERAS_HOME is not set. This change ensures that the cache directory is consistent with the KERAS_HOME directory, fixing the inconsistency observed in the test case.
