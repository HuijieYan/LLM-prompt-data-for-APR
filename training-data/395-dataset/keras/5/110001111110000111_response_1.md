The error message indicates that the expected directory for storing the cache is '/Users/jerry/.keras' but the actual directory is '/private/var/folders/ng/72llsm517x12c2p18htksyjc0000gn/T/pytest-of-jerry/pytest-1422/popen-gw0/test_data_utils0/.keras'. This indicates that the function 'get_file()' is not properly handling the cache directory when the 'KERAS_HOME' is not set to the default directory.

The potential error location within the function 'get_file()' is the handling of the cache directory when the 'cache_dir' parameter is not provided and 'KERAS_HOME' is set to a custom directory.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is using the default cache directory ('~/.keras') when 'cache_dir' is not provided, regardless of the value of 'KERAS_HOME'. This results in conflicting directories for config files and cached data.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if 'KERAS_HOME' is set and use it as the base directory for the cache if available. If 'cache_dir' is not provided and 'KERAS_HOME' is not set, then the function can default to using the default cache directory ('~/.keras').

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.

    By default the file at the url `origin` is downloaded to the
    cache_dir `~/.keras`, placed in the cache_subdir `datasets`,
    and given the filename `fname`. The final location of a file
    `example.txt` would therefore be `~/.keras/datasets/example.txt`.

    Files in tar, tar.gz, tar.bz, and zip formats can also be extracted.
    Passing a hash will verify the file after download. The command line
    programs `shasum` and `sha256sum` can compute the hash.

    # Arguments
    ... (same as original)

    # Returns
    ... (same as original)
    """  # noqa
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.path.expanduser(os.environ['KERAS_HOME'])
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making the above changes, the function will now correctly handle the cache directory based on the value of 'KERAS_HOME' or default to the standard cache directory when 'cache_dir' is not provided.
