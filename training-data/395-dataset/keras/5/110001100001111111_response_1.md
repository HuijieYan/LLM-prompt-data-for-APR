The issue here is that the default cache directory is always set to `~/.keras`, which may not be the desired behavior for all users. The bug occurs when `KERAS_HOME` is set to a different location, but the cache directory remains as `~/.keras`.

To fix this bug, the `cache_dir` parameter needs to be passed down to the `get_file` function and be used as the base directory for the cache.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the `get_file` function to use the provided `cache_dir` as the base directory for the cache instead of always defaulting to `~/.keras`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.
    
    By default the file at the url `origin` is downloaded to the
    cache_dir, placed in the cache_subdir `datasets`,
    and given the filename `fname`. The final location of a file
    `example.txt` would therefore be `cache_dir/datasets/example.txt`.
    
    ... (other function comments remain unchanged) ...
    
    # Returns
        Path to the downloaded file
    """  # noqa
    
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
        
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected function allows for the `cache_dir` to be specified, and if it is `None`, the default behavior of using `~/.keras` will still apply.

By using the `cache_dir` parameter and allowing it to be specified by the user, the function becomes more flexible and can accommodate different cache directory configurations.
