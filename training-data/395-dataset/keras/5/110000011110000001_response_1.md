The test_data_utils test function is designed to test the get_file function by simulating interactions with files and archives. The error message indicates that there is an assertion error related to the location of the Keras configuration path. The error occurred because the actual and expected paths did not match.

The potential error in the problematic function (get_file) is likely related to the handling of the cache_dir and datadir_base paths. These paths are used to construct the final path for the downloaded file.

The bug occurred because the datadir_base was incorrectly constructed, leading to an incorrect Keras configuration path.

To fix the bug, the cache_dir and datadir_base paths should be handled correctly to ensure that the final path for the downloaded file is accurate.

The corrected code for the problematic function get_file is as follows:

```python
import os
import tarfile
import zipfile
from urllib.request import urlretrieve
from urllib.error import URLError, HTTPError

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
    if md5_hash is not None and file_hash is None:
        file_hash = md5_hash
        hash_algorithm = 'md5'
    datadir_base = cache_dir
    if not os.access(datadir_base, os.W_OK):
        datadir_base = os.path.join('/tmp', '.keras')
    datadir = os.path.join(datadir_base, cache_subdir)
    if not os.path.exists(datadir):
        os.makedirs(datadir)

    if untar:
        untar_fpath = os.path.join(datadir, fname)
        fpath = untar_fpath + '.tar.gz'
    else:
        fpath = os.path.join(datadir, fname)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # (Remaining code for the function)
    # ...

    return fpath
```

In the corrected code, the datadir_base is assigned directly to cache_dir without calling os.path.expanduser. This ensures that the Keras cache directory is set correctly. Additionally, the construction of datadir and fpath remains the same as in the original function.
