Potential error location: 

The potential error location is in the block of code that handles the case when ssh_config is false. In this case, the arglist is being assigned an empty list, but the subsequent if condition checks for job.jar() not being present, which can lead to a HadoopJarJobError being raised. Additionally, there is an error message and another HadoopJarJobError being raised if the job jar does not exist.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when ssh_config is false properly. It should check for job.jar() first before raising an error if it does not exist.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 

We can fix the bug by checking for job.jar() existence before raising an error, and reorganizing the logic inside the if-else blocks to properly handle the cases when ssh_config is true or false.

Corrected code:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner or job jar does not exist")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                   '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                        '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
        
    else:
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")
        arglist = []
    
    # Remaining code stays the same
```
