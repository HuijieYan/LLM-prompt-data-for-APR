Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function is that the `arglist` variable is being used without being initialized. It is being initialized only in the `else` block, which is making it inaccessible within the `if ssh_config` block.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `arglist` variable is not initialized before being used in the `if ssh_config` block. This leads to an error when trying to append to `arglist` within this block.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `arglist` variable should be initialized before the `if ssh_config` block. Additionally, the specific checks for `job.jar()` and `os.path.exists(job.jar())` should be outside of the `else` block to ensure they are always executed.

Corrected Code:
```python
def run_job(self, job):
    arglist = []  # Initialize arglist here
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar():
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist += ['ssh', '-i', key_file, '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null', '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
    else:
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
