1. The test case is attempting to check for a `HadoopJarJobError` when the `run` method is called. This error is expected to occur when the `job.jar()` returns `None` while trying to get its absolute path in the `run_job` method of the `HadoopJarJobTask`. 

2. The potential error location within the `run_job` method is identified as the line where `os.path.abspath(job.jar())` is called. This line is attempting to get the absolute path of the `job.jar()` which may be causing the `TypeError` due to `job.jar()` returning `None`.

3. The bug is occurring because the `job.jar()` method is returning `None`, and when the `os.path.abspath` function is called with `None` as an argument, it raises a `TypeError` because it expects a string, bytes, or an os.PathLike object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `job.jar()` returns a valid path before attempting to get its absolute path using `os.path.abspath`. This may involve handling cases where `job.jar()` may be `None` and appropriately raising an error or handling the scenario.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `run_job` method with the bug fix:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar():
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                   '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                        '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
    else:
        arglist = []
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s", job.jar())
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
``` 

In the corrected code, we removed the usage of `os.path.abspath(job.jar())` and directly handled the scenario where `job.jar()` is `None`. We also updated the error message to clearly indicate the issue when the job jar is not found.
