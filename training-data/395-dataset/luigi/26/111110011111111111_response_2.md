The error message indicates that the function `os.path.abspath(job.jar())` is raising a `TypeError` because it is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected string, bytes, or `os.PathLike` object.

The potential error location within the function is in the `else` block where `arglist` is initialized. If `job.jar()` is `None` or the path to the jar file does not exist, it logs an error and raises a `HadoopJarJobError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not correctly handle the case where `job.jar()` returns `None` or when the path to the jar file does not exist.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the case where `job.jar()` is `None` or the path to the jar file does not exist, and to raise a `HadoopJarJobError` in these situations.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_job` function:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        # ... (omitted code)
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar():
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                   '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                        '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
    else:
        arglist = []
        if job.jar() is None or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            jar_path = job.jar() if job.jar() else "unknown"
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", jar_path, os.path.abspath(jar_path))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")
        # ... (omitted code)

    # ... (omitted code)
``` 

In the corrected code, the `else` block is modified to handle the case where `job.jar()` is `None` or the path to the jar file does not exist. It logs an error with the jar path and raises a `HadoopJarJobError` in these situations.
