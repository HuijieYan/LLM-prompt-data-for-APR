Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the assignment of `arglist` variable when `ssh_config` is empty. The code does not handle this case properly and may result in the `arglist` being empty, which will cause an error further down the code when trying to append elements to it.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case when `ssh_config` is empty, leading to `arglist` not being initialized properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can initialize `arglist` at the beginning of the function and then handle the cases where `ssh_config` is empty and when it is not. This will ensure `arglist` is always initialized, and we can then append elements to it as needed.

Corrected code:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    arglist = []  # Initialize arglist

    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar():
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                   '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                        '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
    else:
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, we initialize `arglist` at the beginning of the function, and then handle the cases where `ssh_config` is not empty and when it is empty. This ensures `arglist` is always initialized and can be appended to as needed.
