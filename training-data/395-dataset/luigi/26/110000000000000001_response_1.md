Potential error location: 
One potential error is that the `arglist` variable is defined within the if-else block and is being used after the block, potentially causing a NameError if the `ssh_config` is not defined.

Reasons for the bug:
The `arglist` variable is being defined conditionally within the if-else block, and it is used later outside the block. If the condition is not met, the `arglist` will not be defined, causing an error when it is used later in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to define the `arglist` variable outside the if-else block and then modify its values within the conditional blocks. This will ensure that the `arglist` variable is always defined and can be used throughout the function.

Corrected code:
```python
# corrected function
import os
import luigi.contrib.hdfs
import luigi.contrib.hadoop

def run_job(self, job):
    arglist = []  # Define arglist outside the if-else block

    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar():
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                   '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                        '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
    else:
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
