The buggy function `parse` handles parsing by first calling `json.loads` and then `ast.literal_eval` as a fallback. The issue occurs when the input parameter `x` is a string representing a list i.e. `'[1, 2, 3]'` as a TupleParameter. In this case, the `json.loads` will not work as it expects the parentheses to be present to represent a tuple. Therefore, it will raise a TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable.

To fix this issue:
1. We can handle this case by checking if the input string starts and ends with square brackets, which would indicate that it represents a list, and then we can directly convert it to a tuple.
2. If the input string does not represent a list, we can continue using the existing implementation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    
    # Add a check to see if the input string represents a list, then return a tuple
    if x.startswith('[') and x.endswith(']'):
        return tuple(ast.literal_eval(x))
    else:
        try:
            # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
            return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
        except ValueError:
            return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
 ```
