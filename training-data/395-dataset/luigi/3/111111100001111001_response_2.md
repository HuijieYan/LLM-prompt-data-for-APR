The bug in the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class arises from the fact that it is trying to interpret a JSON string as a tuple. If the JSON string cannot be parsed, it falls back to using `ast.literal_eval`, but it doesn't handle the case where the input is a regular tuple as a string.

To fix this bug, the function should attempt to parse the input as JSON and if that fails, it should check if the input is already a tuple and then parse it using `ast.literal_eval`.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Try parsing input as JSON
        return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        try:
            # Try parsing input as a tuple using ast.literal_eval
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
            # If parsing using ast.literal_eval also fails, raise an error
            raise
```

With this fix, the method first tries to parse the input as JSON, and if that fails, it tries to evaluate it using `ast.literal_eval`. If that also fails, it will raise an error.
