The error occurs when using a TupleParameter in a dynamic dependency in Python 3.6.5. The error message indicates that a 'TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable' is being raised, which suggests that there is an issue with trying to convert an 'int' object to a tuple.

The issue is occurring in the `parse` function in the Python file "/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_3/luigi/parameter.py". The problematic part of the code is trying to handle the parsing of the input `x`. It first tries to parse `x` using `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)`, and if that fails, it tries to parse `x` using `literal_eval(x)`.

The `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable` is being caused by the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` as it's trying to convert each element in the `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` result into a tuple, which is not necessary and leads to the error.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to change the parsing logic in the `parse` function to handle the conversion of the input `x` into a tuple more gracefully, without forcing each element to be a tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import ast
import json

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Attempt to parse `x` using json.loads
        result = json.loads(x)
        # Check if the result is a tuple
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            return result
        else:
            # If it's not a tuple, raise a TypeError
            raise TypeError("Expected a tuple, but received: {}".format(result))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        # If json.loads fails, try using ast.literal_eval
        try:
            # Attempt to parse `x` using ast.literal_eval
            result = ast.literal_eval(x)
            if isinstance(result, tuple):
                return result
            else:
                # If it's not a tuple, raise a TypeError
                raise TypeError("Expected a tuple, but received: {}".format(result))
        except Exception as e:
            # If both parsing methods fail, raise the error
            raise e
```

This corrected code first tries to parse `x` using `json.loads` and then `ast.literal_eval` and returns the result if it's a tuple. If parsing fails in both cases, it raises the original error.
