Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class in the `luigi` library.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `parse` method is attempting to iterate over the input `x`, assuming it is a tuple, but the `x` input is not a tuple. This is evident from the error message "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable".

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the input `x` before attempting to iterate over it as a tuple.
2. If `x` is a string representing a tuple, attempt to parse it as a tuple using `ast.literal_eval`.
3. If parsing as a tuple using `ast.literal_eval` fails, handle the error appropriately.

```python
# Corrected `parse` method

import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Check if `x` is a string
        if isinstance(x, str):
            # Attempt to parse the string as a tuple using ast.literal_eval
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
        else:
            # If it's not a string, raise a ValueError
            raise ValueError("Input is not a string")
    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
        # If ast.literal_eval fails, handle the error appropriately
        raise ValueError("Unable to parse the input as a tuple")
