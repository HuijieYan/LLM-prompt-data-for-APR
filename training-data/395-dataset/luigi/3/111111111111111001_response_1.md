The test case `testSerialize` tries to create a tuple `(1, 2, 3)` and then serializes and parses it using the `luigi.TupleParameter().serialize` and `luigi.TupleParameter().parse` functions respectively. The error occurs in the `luigi.TupleParameter().parse` function due to a TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable.

The potential error location within the `parse` function is the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))`, specifically the `tuple(x)` part. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parse` function is trying to iterate over the variable `x` as if it's a collection, but `x` is a string and cannot be directly iterated over.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the input `x` is a string representing a tuple. We can use `ast.literal_eval` to safely evaluate the string representation of a tuple.

The corrected code for the `parse` function is as follows:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
        return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except ValueError:
        try:
            return ast.literal_eval(x)  # Safely evaluate the string representation of a tuple
        except ValueError:
            raise ValueError("Unable to parse the input as a tuple")
```

With this correction, the `parse` function should now handle both normal tuple inputs and string representations of tuples.
