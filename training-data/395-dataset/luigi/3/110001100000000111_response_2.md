The error is occurring within the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class. The method attempts to parse a tuple from the input string, first using `json.loads` and then falling back to `ast.literal_eval` if `json.loads` raises a `ValueError`.

The error message `"TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable"` indicates that somewhere in the code, an integer is being used as an iterable, which is not allowed. This is likely happening during the parsing process, where a non-iterable object is being treated as an iterable.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `parse` method to handle the case where the input is a JSON string that represents a tuple, as well as the case where the input is a string literal that represents a tuple.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import json
import ast
from collections import OrderedDict

class TupleParameter:
    def parse(self, x):
        """
        Parse an individual value from the input.

        :param str x: the value to parse.
        :return: the parsed value.
        """
        try:
            # Attempt to parse using json.loads
            parsed_value = json.loads(x)
            if isinstance(parsed_value, tuple):
                # Ensure that the parsed value is a tuple
                return parsed_value
            else:
                raise ValueError("Value is not a valid tuple")
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            try:
                # If json.loads fails, try using ast.literal_eval
                parsed_value = ast.literal_eval(x)
                if isinstance(parsed_value, tuple):
                    # Ensure that the parsed value is a tuple
                    return parsed_value
                else:
                    raise ValueError("Value is not a valid tuple")
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                raise ValueError("Could not parse the input as a tuple")
```

In the corrected code, we use `json.loads` to attempt to parse the input string as a JSON object. If that fails, we fall back to `ast.literal_eval` to parse the input string as a Python literal. We then validate that the parsed value is indeed a tuple before returning it. If the input cannot be parsed as a tuple, a `ValueError` is raised.
