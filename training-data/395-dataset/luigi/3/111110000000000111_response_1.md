The error occurs when the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class is trying to convert the input value into a tuple, and it encounters an `int` object, which is not iterable.

The potential error location is the line where the method is trying to parse the input into a tuple of tuples using `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `json.loads` is creating an integer object instead of a tuple, causing the TypeError when trying to iterate over it.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `parse` method to handle the conversion of input properly. We can first check if the input is a JSON string so that we can use `json.loads` to parse it directly into a tuple of tuples. If it's not a valid JSON representation, we can use `ast.literal_eval` to safely parse the input into a tuple of tuples.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import json
import ast
import luigi.parameter

class TupleParameter(luigi.parameter.ListParameter):
    # ... other code ...

    def parse(self, x):
        try:
            # Check if the input is a valid JSON string
            return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x))
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError, ValueError):
            # If not, fall back to ast.literal_eval
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
```
