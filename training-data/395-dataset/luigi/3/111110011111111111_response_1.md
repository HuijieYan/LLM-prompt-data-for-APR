The error is occurring in the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class. The `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable` is being raised when calling `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))`.

The reason for the bug is that the `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` is returning a list of integers, and the `tuple()` function is then being called on each integer separately, causing the 'int' object is not iterable error.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `parse` method to handle both the list and string representations of tuples correctly. We can achieve this by checking the type of the object returned by `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` and converting it accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        loaded_value = json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)
        if isinstance(loaded_value, list):
            return tuple(tuple(sub_x) for sub_x in loaded_value)
        else:
            raise ValueError  # raising a ValueError to handle non-list objects
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```

With this corrected code, the `parse` method will now correctly handle both list and string representations of tuples, resulting in the avoidance of the 'int' object is not iterable error.
