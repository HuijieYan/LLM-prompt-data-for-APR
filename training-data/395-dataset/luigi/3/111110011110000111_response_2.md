The error message indicates a TypeError at line 1116 of the `luigi/parameter.py` file, particularly within the `parse` function. The error occurs when trying to create a tuple using a generator expression, but encountering an 'int' object that is not iterable.

The potential error in the code is within the `parse` function, specifically in the line:

```python
return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
```

This line attempts to create a tuple using a generator expression, but it seems to be expecting the input `x` to be a nested iterable. This approach is incorrect and is causing the TypeError.

The bug occurs because the code wrongly assumes that the JSON returned from `json.loads(x)` would always be nested iterables when in fact, it might not be.

To fix the bug, we should handle this scenario by checking the type of the loaded JSON object before attempting to create a tuple from it.

Here's the corrected code for the `TupleParameter.parse` function:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    try:
        loaded = json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)
        if isinstance(loaded, (tuple, list)) and all(isinstance(item, (tuple, list)) for item in loaded):
            # The loaded object fits the expected structure, so we can safely return a tuple
            return tuple(loaded)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid value structure")
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```

This updated code checks the type of the loaded JSON object and its nested structure. If the structure is as expected, it is converted to a tuple. Otherwise, a ValueError is raised to indicate an invalid value structure.
