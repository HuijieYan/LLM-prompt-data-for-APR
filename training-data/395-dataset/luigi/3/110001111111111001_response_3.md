Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` inside the `parse` function.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" is occurring because the `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` is returning an integer, and the subsequent `tuple(x) for x in ...` part is trying to iterate over it as if it were a collection.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
It seems that the input `x` is expected to be a JSON-formatted string, which will be deserialized to a tuple. If `x` is a JSON-like string, it should be deserialized using `json.loads(x)`. If it's not, it should be evaluated using `ast.literal_eval(x)`. Additionally, considering the error message, handling the condition when a non-iterable object is returned from `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` is necessary to prevent the TypeError.

Corrected Code:
```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Try deserializing x as JSON
        return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        try:
            # Try using ast.literal_eval if JSON deserialization fails
            return literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
            # Handle the error if both methods fail
            raise e
```
