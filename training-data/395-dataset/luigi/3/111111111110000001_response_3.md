The test function `testSerialize` in the `parameter_test.py` file is calling the `luigi.TupleParameter()` method to parse and serialize a tuple. The error message shows that the function is throwing a `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` line. This is trying to convert each individual element in the `x` JSON object into a tuple, which is causing the 'int' object not iterable error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the provided code is trying to convert individual elements into tuples, which is unnecessary as the outer structure itself is a tuple.

To fix this bug, we can remove the unnecessary tuple conversion and directly return the parsed value as a tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import json
from ast import literal_eval

# class declaration containing the correct function
class TupleParameter(ListParameter):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def parse(self, x):
        """
        Parse an individual value from the input.

        :param str x: the value to parse.
        :return: the parsed value.
        """
        try:
            return json.loads(x)
        except ValueError:
            return literal_eval(x)
```
With this correction, the function will now parse the input value `x` as a tuple using the `json.loads(x)` method. If that fails, it will fall back to using `literal_eval(x)` to parse the input string as a tuple. This approach removes the unnecessary tuple conversion and directly returns the parsed value as a tuple, resolving the TypeError.
