From the error message, it is clear that the issue is occurring in the `parse` method of the `luigi.TupleParameter` class. The error `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable` is being raised at line 1116 of `luigi/parameter.py`. This suggests that there might be an issue with iterating over an integer object.

The reason for this bug is that the buggy `parse` method is expecting the input `x` to be a JSON string that represents a tuple of tuples. However, it is possible that `x` is not always a valid JSON string, and when it is not, it falls back to `ast.literal_eval(x)`. The bug occurs when `x` is actually an integer, as it cannot be iterated over with the current implementation.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to handle the case where `x` might be an integer and not a JSON string. For example, we can use a conditional check to first test if `x` is a JSON string. If it is not, then we can simply return `x` as a tuple.

The corrected code for the `parse` method of `luigi.TupleParameter` is as follows:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    if isinstance(x, str) and x.startswith('[') and x.endswith(']'):
        try:
            # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
            return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
        except ValueError:
            return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
    else:
        return (x,)
```
