The issue is caused by the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class. The function is trying to parse a tuple from a JSON string, but when the input is not a valid JSON string, it falls back to using `ast.literal_eval` to parse the string. 

However, the approach of using `json.loads` followed by `ast.literal_eval` is causing the error because `ast.literal_eval` expects a string that represents a valid Python expression, and `'[1, 2, 3]'` is not a valid Python expression to represent a tuple.

To fix this issue, we need to directly handle the parsing of the input string to a tuple without relying on `ast.literal_eval`. We can achieve this using `eval`, which can handle the string representation of tuples correctly.

Here's the corrected `parse` function for the `TupleParameter` class:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    try:
        return tuple(tuple(y) for y in eval(x))
    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Could not parse input: {x}") from e
```

In this updated code, we use `eval(x)` to evaluate the input string directly as a Python expression, which will correctly parse the tuple from the input string. We also catch both `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions and re-raise them as `ValueError` with a meaningful error message.

With this correction, the `parse` function should be able to handle the input correctly and avoid the `TypeError` that was previously occurring.
