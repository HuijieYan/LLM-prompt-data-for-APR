The test case is trying to validate whether the `serialize` and `parse` functions of `TupleParameter` work correctly. However, the `parse` function is causing a `TypeError` because it is trying to iterate over an integer object.

The potential error location is in the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class at line 1116 of the `luigi/parameter.py` file.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parse` function is assuming that the input `x` is a tuple, but in the test case, `x` is a string representation of a list `[1, 2, 3]`. When the `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` is executed, it returns a list which is an iterable, and the list comprehension `tuple(x) for x in ...` is trying to iterate over an integer.

To fix this bug, we can directly convert the string representation of a list to a tuple using `ast.literal_eval`. This approach will handle both the case of a JSON-formatted string and a plain tuple-formatted string.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    try:
        return tuple(ast.literal_eval(x))
    except (SyntaxError, ValueError):
        return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
```

With this correction, the `parse` function should be able to handle both JSON-formatted and plain tuple-formatted strings correctly.
