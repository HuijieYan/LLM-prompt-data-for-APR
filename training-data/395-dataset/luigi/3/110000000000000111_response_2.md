1. The test case provided is related to passing a `TupleParameter` in a dynamic dependency, which results in a `TypeError` in Python 3.6.5.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `parse` method, specifically the following line of code:
```python
return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
```

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to iterate over an integer value inside the `tuple` comprehension, which is causing the `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the potential TypeError by using a `try-except` block for `TypeError` in addition to `ValueError`. We should also import the required modules `json` and `ast` for proper parsing.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
        return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):  # Handle both ValueError and TypeError
        try:
            return literal_eval(x)
        except:
            raise  # If this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```

By handling both `ValueError` and `TypeError` and using the `ast.literal_eval`, we can ensure that the function will be able to parse the input properly and handle any unexpected errors.
