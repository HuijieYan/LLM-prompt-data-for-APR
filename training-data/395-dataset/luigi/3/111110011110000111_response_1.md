The test case `testSerialize` doesn't have a direct relationship with the error message. The error occurs while trying to parse a tuple using the `luigi.TupleParameter().parse()` method.

The error occurs because the `parse` method is attempting to convert an integer into a tuple. This is due to the fact that `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` is encountering an integer and trying to iterate over it when it's expecting an iterable.

To fix this, we should check if the input `x` is a string representing a tuple and if not, then we should attempt to use `literal_eval(x)`. If the `literal_eval` raises an error, it should be allowed to propagate.

Below is the corrected code for the `parse` method within the `TupleParameter` class:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    try:
        # Attempt to parse the input string as JSON
        return tuple(tuple(entry) for entry in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        try:
            # Attempt to parse the input string using literal_eval
            return literal_eval(x)
        except ValueError:
            # If literal_eval also fails, let the exception propagate
            raise
```

With this correction, the method first tries to parse the input string as JSON, and if that fails with either a `ValueError` or a `TypeError`, it then tries to use `literal_eval`. If both methods fail, the original exception is allowed to propagate.

This fix should handle various cases of input strings representing tuples.
