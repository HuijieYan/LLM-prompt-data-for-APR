Potential error location: The error seems to occur when trying to convert the input `x` to a tuple using `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)`.

Reason for the bug: The input `x` is a string representing a list, but the current implementation attempts to convert it directly to a tuple, which results in a 'TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable' due to the wrong data type.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. First, check if the input `x` is a valid JSON string using a try-except block.
2. If it is a valid JSON string, use `json.loads(x)` to convert it to a list, and then convert the list to a tuple.
3. If it is not a valid JSON string, use `ast.literal_eval(x)` to convert it to a list and then to a tuple.
4. Handle exceptions appropriately and allow errors to be raised if the conversion fails.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import json
import ast

# this is the corrected function
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Check if x is a valid JSON string
        json_value = json.loads(x)
        # Convert the JSON value to a tuple
        return tuple(json_value)
    except ValueError:
        # If x is not a valid JSON string, use ast.literal_eval
        return tuple(ast.literal_eval(x))
```
By using the corrected function, we can handle both JSON strings and regular strings, correctly converting them to tuples as needed.
