The error occurs in the `TupleParameter` class, particularly in the `parse` method. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to iterating over an integer object.

After analyzing the `parse` method and the test case, the issue seems to be with the conversion of the input value `x` into a tuple of tuples. The current approach converts the input value using `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` and then tries to convert the result into a tuple of tuples. However, this may produce a `TypeError` if the input is not in the expected format.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `parse` method to handle both cases (regular string and JSON string) and utilize the `ast.literal_eval` function to safely evaluate the input string.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import ast
import json
import luigi
from collections import OrderedDict

# class declaration containing the buggy function
# ... omitted code ...

# this is the corrected function
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```

By using `ast.literal_eval` as a fallback if `json.loads` fails, we can handle both JSON strings and regular tuple strings, thereby addressing the TypeError issue.
