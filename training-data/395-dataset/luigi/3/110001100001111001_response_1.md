The bug in the provided function is that it tries to parse a string as a tuple of tuples using both `json.loads` and `ast.literal_eval` without handling the case where the input is a simple list instead of a tuple. This causes a ValueError when trying to parse a simple list with `json.loads`.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where the input is a simple list directly with `ast.literal_eval`. We can also remove the unnecessary loop and the reference to `_FrozenOrderedDict`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Try parsing as a tuple of tuples
        return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x))
    except ValueError:
        try:
            # Try parsing as a simple list
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
        except ValueError as e:
            # If both methods fail, raise the original error
            raise e
```

With this corrected code, the function will try to parse the input as a tuple of tuples using `json.loads`, and if that fails, it will try to parse it as a simple list using `ast.literal_eval`. If both methods fail, the original error will be raised.
