The test case provided is attempting to use a TupleParameter in a dynamic dependency in Luigi, but it results in a TypeError in Python 3.6.5.

Upon analyzing the error message, it seems that the error occurs in the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class. Specifically, the line that attempts to convert the input `x` into a tuple is causing the issue.

The root cause of the bug is that the `parse` method is assuming that the input `x` will always be a valid JSON string representing a tuple, but in the test case provided, the input `x` is actually a tuple of integers.

To fix the bug, the `parse` method needs to be modified to handle both cases â€“ when `x` is a valid JSON string representing a tuple and when `x` is a tuple of integers.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import json
from ast import literal_eval
from collections import OrderedDict as _FrozenOrderedDict

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    # The goal is to handle both JSON strings representing tuples and tuples of integers.
    try:
        # Attempt to parse the input as a JSON string.
        return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        try:
            # If parsing as JSON fails, attempt to parse the input using ast.literal_eval.
            return literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
            # If parsing using ast.literal_eval also fails, then raise a ValueError.
            raise ValueError("Failed to parse the input")
```

This corrected code first tries to parse the input `x` as a JSON string using `json.loads`. If that fails, it then tries to parse the input using `ast.literal_eval`. If both methods fail, it raises a `ValueError`. This should handle the different scenarios where the input `x` can be a JSON string or a tuple of integers.
