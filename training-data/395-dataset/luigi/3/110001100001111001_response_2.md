Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function occurs when trying to parse the input value `x` as a tuple of tuples using the `json.loads` method. Since the input `x` is in the form of a list of integers as a string (`'[1, 2, 3]'`), it will result in a `ValueError` when attempting to parse it using `json.loads`.

Reason behind the bug: The function is trying to parse the input `x` as a tuple of tuples using `json.loads`, which is designed to parse valid JSON strings. However, the input `x` is not in the form of a valid JSON string that represents a tuple of tuples, leading to the `ValueError`.

Approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can first check whether the input `x` is a valid JSON string, and if not, then attempt to parse it using `ast.literal_eval` which can handle the non-JSON tuple string format.

Corrected code:
```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except ValueError:
        return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```
In the corrected code, we have added an import statement for the `ast` module and modified the exception handling to first attempt parsing the input using `json.loads`, and if it fails, then fall back to using `ast.literal_eval` for non-JSON tuple string format.
