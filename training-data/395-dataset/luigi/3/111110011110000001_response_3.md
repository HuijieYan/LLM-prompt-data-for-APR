The error occurs when trying to serialize and then deserialize a tuple using the `TupleParameter` class. The error is a `TypeError` stating that an 'int' object is not iterable. This means that the `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` call is returning an integer instead of the expected list of tuples.

The potential error location is primarily in the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class where the `json.loads` method is used to load the input string and convert it into a tuple.

The reason behind the bug is that the input string is being passed directly to `json.loads`, which is not handling tuple structures correctly. Additionally, the code currently does not handle the case where the input is a tuple string (as opposed to a JSON string).

To fix this bug, we can modify the `parse` function by first checking if the input string starts with "(" and ends with ")", which would indicate that it's a tuple string. If it is, we can use `ast.literal_eval` to parse the string. If not, we can proceed with the existing approach of using `json.loads`. This ensures that both tuple strings and JSON strings are correctly handled.

Here is the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import json
import ast

class TupleParameter(ListParameter):
    # other methods...

    def parse(self, x):
        """
        Parse an individual value from the input.

        :param str x: the value to parse.
        :return: the parsed value.
        """
        # Check if the input is a tuple string or a JSON string
        if x.startswith('(') and x.endswith(')'):
            return literal_eval(x)
        else:
            # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
            return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
```

With this fix, the `parse` function now correctly handles both tuple strings and JSON strings, avoiding the `TypeError` encountered during serialization and deserialization.
