Based on the error message, the issue is occurring in the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class. The error message indicates that a 'int' object is not iterable, which suggests that the code is trying to iterate over an integer, causing a TypeError.

The issue is likely arising from the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` within the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class. It seems that the code is incorrectly trying to iterate over the individual elements of the loaded JSON object and convert them into tuples, leading to the 'int' object not iterable error.

To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle the parsing of the input, specifically when converting the JSON string into a tuple of tuples.

Here is the corrected function for the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    try:
        # Attempt to load the input using json.loads
        return json.loads(x)
    except ValueError:
        try:
            # If ValueError occurs, attempt to parse using ast.literal_eval
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
            raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
```

In the corrected code, the `parse` method first attempts to load the input using `json.loads`. If that fails with a `ValueError`, it then attempts to parse the input using `ast.literal_eval`. If both parsing methods fail, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message. This approach ensures that the parsing is handled correctly, and any errors during parsing are appropriately caught and handled.
