The error occurs when trying to parse a TupleParameter in a dynamic dependency in Python 3.6.5. The error message indicates a TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable. This suggests an issue with the parsing of the tuple parameter.

The potential error location is within the parse function, specifically in the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))`. This line attempts to convert the input x into a tuple, but the error suggests that x is a single integer value rather than an iterable sequence.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the current code attempts to parse the input x into a tuple unconditionally. If x is not in the expected format, it will result in a TypeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the TypeError explicitly when trying to convert the input x into a tuple. If a TypeError is encountered, it should fall back to using ast.literal_eval to parse the input x.

Here's the corrected code for the parse function:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Attempt to parse using json.loads
        parsed_value = json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)
        return tuple(parsed_value)  # If successful, convert to tuple
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        try:
            # If json.loads fails, try using ast.literal_eval
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
            # If ast.literal_eval also fails, raise an error
            raise ValueError("Unable to parse input")
```
