The provided function `parse` expects a string `x` as input and tries to parse it into a tuple of tuples. The bug occurs when a string representing a list is passed as input, resulting in a TypeError. The function is attempting to parse the string using `json.loads(x)`, expecting it to return a list that can be converted into a tuple. However, when the input is a string representing a list, it's not directly parsable by `json.loads`, resulting in an error.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the input string represents a list; if so, it should process it accordingly. The corrected function should use `ast.literal_eval` to parse the string directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # If input is a string representing a list
        if x.startswith('[') and x.endswith(']'):
            # Parse the list string using ast.literal_eval and convert it to a tuple
            return tuple(ast.literal_eval(x))
        else:
            # Parse the input using json.loads assuming it's a valid JSON
            return tuple(tuple(elem) for elem in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
        # If this causes an error, let that error be raised
        raise
```

This corrected function first checks if the input `x` represents a list using `startswith` and `endswith`. If it does, it uses `ast.literal_eval` to parse the list string. If not, it uses `json.loads` as before to handle other valid JSON representations. If either method fails, the error is propagated by raising it.
