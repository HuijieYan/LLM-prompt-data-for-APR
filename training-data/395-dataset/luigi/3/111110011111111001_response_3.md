The error is occurring inside the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` because the variable `x` is being treated as an iterable (like a tuple) when it is actually a string.

The bug is happening because the original function tries to convert the input `x` into a tuple of tuples by using a generator expression that iterates over the elements of `x`, assuming that `x` is already a list of tuples. However, the input `x` is actually a string representation of a list, and it needs to be converted to a proper Python data structure before being treated as an iterable.

To fix this bug, the `parse` function needs to handle the case where `x` is a string. It should first deserialize the string into a proper Python data structure before attempting to create a tuple of tuples.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Deserialize the string `x` into a proper Python data structure
        parsed_value = json.loads(x)

        # Check if the parsed_value is a list and each element is a tuple
        if isinstance(parsed_value, list) and all(isinstance(item, tuple) for item in parsed_value):
            return tuple(parsed_value)
        else:
            # If not a list of tuples, raise a ValueError
            raise ValueError("Input is not a list of tuples")
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        try:
            # If the input is not a valid JSON string, try to evaluate it as a literal
            return literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
            # If this causes an error, let that error be raised.
            raise ValueError("Unable to parse the input")
```

With this fix, the function first tries to deserialize the input `x` as JSON and check if the result is a list of tuples. If that fails, it falls back to evaluating `x` as a literal to retrieve the input data.
