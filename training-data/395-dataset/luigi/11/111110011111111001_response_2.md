The test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` adds several tasks to the scheduler using `add_task` and `add_task_batcher` methods, and then it calls the `get_work` method. The expected result is that the response should have a certain format and certain content.

The error occurs in the assertion `self.assertEqual({'a': ['1', '3', '4']}, response['task_params'])`. The actual value of `response['task_params']` is `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`, which leads to the assertion failure.

The potential error location within the `get_work` function is the logic that constructs the `response['task_params']`. It seems like the logic is not correctly filtering out the tasks that are not ready and creating the batch parameters.

The bug occurs because the `get_work` function is not correctly identifying the tasks that are not ready and therefore includes them in the batch parameters. This leads to incorrect values being returned in the response.

To fix the bug, the logic for identifying which tasks to include in the batch parameters needs to be revised. Tasks that are not ready should be excluded from the batch parameters, and only the ready tasks should be included.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` method:

```python
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code)

    # existing code...

    for task in tasks:
        if task.status == PENDING and in_workers:
            upstream_status = self._upstream_status(task.id, upstream_table)
            if upstream_status != UPSTREAM_DISABLED:
                locally_pending_tasks += 1
                if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                    n_unique_pending += 1

        if task.status == PENDING and in_workers:
            all_deps_ready = all(dep in ['DONE', 'RUNNING'] for dep in task.deps)
            if all_deps_ready:  # Only add ready tasks to batch parameters
                if task.family == best_task.family and len(batched_tasks) < max_batch_size and task.is_batchable() and all(
                        task.params.get(name) == value for name, value in unbatched_params.items()):
                    for name, params in batched_params.items():
                        params.append(task.params.get(name))
                    batched_tasks.append(task)

    # existing code...
```

In the corrected code, an additional check for `all_deps_ready` is added to only include tasks where all dependencies are in a ready state. This ensures that only the ready tasks are added to the batch parameters, which aligns with the expected behavior of the `get_work` method based on the test case.
