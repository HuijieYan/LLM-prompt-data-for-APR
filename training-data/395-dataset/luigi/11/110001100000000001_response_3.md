The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `(best_task and batched_params and task.family == best_task.family and len(batched_tasks) < max_batch_size and task.is_batchable() and all(task.params.get(name) == value for name, value in unbatched_params.items()))`. This condition is likely causing issues due to incorrect logic.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect or conflicting logic in the conditions that decide which task to select.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic for selecting the best task and handling batched tasks. It might also be necessary to ensure that the `is_batchable()` method and the handling of batched parameters is functioning correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: remove any expired nodes

    # Algo: iterate over all nodes, find the highest priority node with no dependencies and available resources.

    # Resource checking both at currently available resources and at which resources would
    # be available if all running tasks died and we rescheduled all workers greedily.

    # TODO: remove tasks that can't be done, figure out if the worker has absolutely
    # nothing it can wait for
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    # Return remaining tasks that have no FAILED descendants
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    batched_params, unbatched_params, batched_tasks, max_batch_size = None, None, [], 1
    best_task = None
    if current_tasks is not None:
        ct_set = set(current_tasks)
        for task in sorted(self.get_running_tasks(), key=lambda task: self._rank(task)):
            if task.worker_running == worker_id and task.id not in ct_set:
                best_task = task
                break  # Select the first task found

    if current_tasks is not None:
        # Batch running tasks that weren't claimed since the last get_work go back in the pool
        self._reset_orphaned_batch_running_tasks(worker_id)

    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []
    # Remaining code unchanged
    ...
```
This corrected code includes modification of the section that handles the selection of the best task, as well as proper break statements to ensure only one task is selected based on the given conditions.
