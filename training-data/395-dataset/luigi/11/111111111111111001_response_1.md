The error occurs in the response comparison within the `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` test case. The error message shows that the expected `task_params` dictionary does not match the actual response.

The potential error location in the code seems to be the process that calculates `batched_params` and `batched_tasks` when iterating through the tasks. The `batched_params` are getting updated incorrectly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual response.

The buggy function is attempting to batch certain tasks together based on their parameters, but it is generating incorrect `batched_params`. Additionally, it might be missing some tasks that should be batched together. This is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual `task_params`.

To fix the bug, the logic for batched parameters needs to be reviewed and corrected. The code should ensure that all eligible tasks that meet the batching criteria are properly included and handled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import hashlib
import itertools
import time
import six
import collections
from luigi.task import Task

# ... (other code)

# this is the corrected function
