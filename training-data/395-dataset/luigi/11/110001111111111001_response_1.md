The test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` is adding tasks with dependencies and testing the response from the `get_work` function. The test is expecting the response to have a specific set of task parameters, but the actual response differs.

The potential error in the `get_work` function seems to be related to the handling of batched tasks and their parameters. When comparing the expected task parameters with the actual task parameters, there is a discrepancy in the values.

The bug appears to stem from the way batched parameters are being handled within the function. It seems that the function is not correctly aggregating the batched parameters when selecting tasks, leading to incorrect responses.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the logic around batched task selection and parameter aggregation in the `get_work` function. Specifically, ensure that the batched parameters are correctly combined and included in the response when batched tasks are selected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    # ... (omitted code)

    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    
    # ... (omitted code)

    # Loop through tasks to find the best task
    for task in tasks:
        # ... (omitted code)

        if (best_task and batched_params and 
            task.family == best_task.family and 
            len(batched_tasks) < max_batch_size and 
            task.is_batchable() and all(
            task.params.get(name) == value for name, value in unbatched_params.items())):

            # Combine batched parameters
            combined_params = best_task.params.copy()
            combined_params.update(batched_params)
            
            # Set the response with batched task details
            reply['task_id'] = None
            reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
            reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
            reply['task_params'] = combined_params
            reply['batch_id'] = batch_id
            reply['batch_task_ids'] = [task.id for task in batched_tasks]

            break
        # ... (omitted code)

    return reply
```

In the corrected code, the batched parameters are correctly combined and included in the response when batched tasks are selected, ensuring that the response matches the expected parameters in the test case.
