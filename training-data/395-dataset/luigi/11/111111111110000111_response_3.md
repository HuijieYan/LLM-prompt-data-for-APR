The error message from the test function indicates that the task_params returned by the `get_work` function does not match the expected value. The expected value is `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}` but the actual returned value is `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`.

The potential error in the `get_work` function is likely to be in the section where it checks for tasks that are pending, running, and how it manipulates the `reply` dictionary.

The buggy code appears to add all the params to the response, including the ones that are not yet ready or failed. This leads to the response containing more params than expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that populates the `reply` dictionary. Specifically, we need to filter out the tasks that are not yet ready or failed before adding their parameters to the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    pending_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
    pending_ready_tasks = []

    # Filter out the tasks that are not yet ready or have failed
    for task in pending_tasks:
        if task.status == PENDING and (assistant and getattr(task, 'runnable', bool(task.workers)) or worker_id in task.workers):
            upstream_status = self._upstream_status(task.id, {})
            if upstream_status != UPSTREAM_DISABLED:
                pending_ready_tasks.append(task)
    
    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': len(pending_ready_tasks),
             'running_tasks': [],
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': len(set(pending_ready_tasks))}

    if pending_ready_tasks:
        best_task = pending_ready_tasks[0]  # Get the task with highest priority

        # Create the response only with parameters of pending and ready tasks
        if len(pending_ready_tasks) > 1:
            params = {name: [task.params[name] for task in pending_ready_tasks] for name in pending_ready_tasks[0].params}
            reply['task_params'] = params
        else:
            reply['task_params'] = pending_ready_tasks[0].params

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['batch_id'] = None

    return reply
```

In this corrected code, we filter out the tasks that are not yet ready or have failed, and then construct the response based only on the parameters of these pending and ready tasks. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected result.
