The potential error in the function is mainly due to the improper handling of the input parameters and their manipulation within the function. The use of various condition checks and loops to manipulate the tasks and resources introduces complexity and potential for errors or unintended behavior.

To fix the bug in the function, it is important to simplify the logic and ensure proper handling of the input parameters and tasks. This can be achieved by breaking down the complex loops and conditions into simpler, more readable statements. Additionally, handling of resources and tasks should be streamlined to avoid redundant or conflicting checks.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()
    
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    relevant_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
    tasks = list(relevant_tasks)
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank, reverse=True)

    running_tasks = []
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    n_unique_pending = 0

    for task in tasks:
        if task.status == PENDING and (assistant or worker_id in task.workers):
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    return reply
```
