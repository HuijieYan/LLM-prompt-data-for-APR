The test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` adds tasks to the scheduler and then calls the `get_work` function to get the next task to be performed by the worker. The error message indicates that the actual response is `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}`, but the expected response is `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`. This suggests that the `get_work` function is not selecting the correct set of tasks for the worker.

The potential error location within the `get_work` function is in the section where it is processing the tasks and selecting the best task to assign to the worker.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug might be due to incorrect selection of tasks based on their dependencies and resources. It seems that the current implementation is not properly considering the dependencies and resource availability while selecting the best task for the worker.

To fix the bug, the selection logic of the best task for the worker needs to be updated to consider task dependencies and resource availability. This would involve proper filtering of tasks based on their status, dependencies, and resource requirements.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    # Return remaining tasks that have no FAILED descendants
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    relevant_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
    relevant_tasks = [task for task in relevant_tasks if self._schedulable(task)]

    best_task = None
    for task in relevant_tasks:
        if self._has_resources(task.resources, self._used_resources()) and task.status == PENDING:
            # Check if the task can be scheduled
            if all(dep.status == DONE for dep in task.deps):
                best_task = task
                break

    reply = {'task_id': None, 'task_family': None, 'task_params': None}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker_id
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

In the corrected function, tasks are properly filtered based on their status, dependencies, and resource requirements. The function selects the best task that meets all the criteria and returns it as the response.
