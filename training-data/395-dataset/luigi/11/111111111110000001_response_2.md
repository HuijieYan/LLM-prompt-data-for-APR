It seems that the test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` is failing due to an assertion error. The error message indicates that the expected task parameters are `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}`, but the actual task parameters are `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`.

Upon analyzing the `get_work` function, it appears that the logic for filtering out the tasks that are not ready or pending might be incorrect. This could lead to incorrect task parameters being returned.

The possible cause of this bug could be the logic that selects the relevant tasks for batch processing. It seems that the logic for selecting only certain pending tasks is flawed and may need to be re-evaluated.

To fix the issue, we should review and revise the logic that filters out pending tasks and identifies the tasks that are eligible for batch processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` method:
```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    # logic for filtering out expired nodes
    
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()
    
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    # Return remaining tasks that have no FAILED descendants
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])
    
    relevant_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
    # apply logic to filter out tasks that are not ready
    tasks = [task for task in relevant_tasks if self._schedulable(task)]
    
    # other logic remains the same ...

    return reply
```

In the corrected code, the main change is in the filtering logic for relevant tasks. We filter the pending tasks based on their readiness using the `_schedulable` method, and then continue with the rest of the logic as before.
