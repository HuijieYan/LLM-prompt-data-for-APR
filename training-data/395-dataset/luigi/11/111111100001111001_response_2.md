The potential error in the function is that it updates the worker and then tries to assign tasks to it, but the worker is not re-initialized after updating it.

The function seems to be trying to assign tasks to a worker, and then also includes some batch processing logic. The presence of multiple if conditions and nested logic makes it hard to trace the flow of the function.

The correction can be done by reinitializing the worker before assigning tasks. The existing worker assignment logic can be refactored to make it easier to follow and troubleshoot in the future. The redundant checks and initializations should be identified and removed.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker

    # Re-initialize the worker
    worker = self._state.get_worker(worker_id)

    # Get remaining tasks that have no FAILED descendants
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    batched_params, unbatched_params, batched_tasks, max_batch_size = None, None, [], 1
    best_task = None

    if current_tasks is not None:
        ct_set = set(current_tasks)
        for task in sorted(self._state.get_running_tasks(), key=self._rank):
            if task.worker_running == worker_id and task.id not in ct_set:
                best_task = task

    if current_tasks is not None:
        # batch running tasks that weren't claimed since the last get_work go back in the pool
        self._reset_orphaned_batch_running_tasks(worker_id)

    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    running_tasks = []
    upstream_table = {}
    greedy_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
    n_unique_pending = 0

    if worker.is_trivial_worker(self._state):
        relevant_tasks = worker.get_pending_tasks(self._state)
        used_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
        greedy_workers = dict()  # If there's no resources, then they can grab any task
    else:
        relevant_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
        used_resources = self._used_resources()
        activity_limit = time.time() - self._config.worker_disconnect_delay
        active_workers = self._state.get_active_workers(last_get_work_gt=activity_limit)
        greedy_workers = dict((worker.id, worker.info.get('workers', 1)) for worker in active_workers)
    tasks = list(relevant_tasks)
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank, reverse=True)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
