Error:
The RPC method `get_work` has multiple errors. There's a missing import for the `collections` module, and several calls to undefined constant variables such as `RUNNING`, `PENDING`, and `UPSTREAM_DISABLED`, causing NameError. Additionally, there's an attempt to call an undefined method `is_trivial_worker`.

Reasons:
The error occurs because of missing imports and referencing undefined variables and methods.

Approach to Fix:
1. Import the `collections` module.
2. Define the constants `RUNNING`, `PENDING`, and `UPSTREAM_DISABLED`.
3. Define the method `is_trivial_worker` either in the current class or import it from another module.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
import collections
import hashlib
import itertools
import time

# Define the constants
RUNNING = "running"
PENDING = "pending"
UPSTREAM_DISABLED = "upstream_disabled"

# Define the method is_trivial_worker if it's not already defined in the class

# Corrected get_work function
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)

    # Resource checking looks both at currently available resources and at which resources would
    # be available if all running tasks died and we rescheduled all workers greedily. We do both
    # checks in order to prevent a worker with many low-priority tasks from starving other
    # workers with higher priority tasks that share the same resources.
