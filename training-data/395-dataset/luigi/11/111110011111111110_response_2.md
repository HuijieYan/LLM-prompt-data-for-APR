    # TODO: remove any expired nodes

    # Algo: iterate over all nodes, find the highest priority node with no dependencies and available resources.

    # Resource checking looks at both currently available resources and at which resources would be available if all running tasks died and we rescheduled all workers greedily. We do both checks in order to prevent a worker with many low-priority tasks from starving other workers with higher priority tasks that share the same resources.

    # TODO: remove tasks that can't be done, figure out if the worker has absolutely nothing it can wait for

    # This important line is to prune the expired tasks or nodes
