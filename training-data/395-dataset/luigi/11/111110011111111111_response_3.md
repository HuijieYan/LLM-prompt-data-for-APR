The error occurs in the function `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` where an assertion error is raised for the `response['task_params']`. The expected value is `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}` but the actual value is `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the `batched_params` are being constructed and returned. It seems that the batched_params are not being constructed correctly.

The bug occurs because the `batch_string` is not being correctly constructed and the `batched_params` are not being populated as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the batched_params are correctly constructed and that the `batch_string` is being concatenated appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Scheduler(object):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    @rpc_method(allow_null=False)
    def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
        # ... existing code ...

        batched_params, unbatched_params, batched_tasks, max_batch_size = None, None, [], 1
        best_task = None
        if current_tasks is not None:
            ct_set = set(current_tasks)
            for task in sorted(self._state.get_running_tasks(), key=self._rank):
                if task.worker_running == worker_id and task.id not in ct_set:
                    best_task = task
        
        # ... existing code ...
                    
        if len(batched_tasks) > 1:
            combined_params = best_task.params.copy()
            combined_params.update(batched_params)
            
            # construct batch_string
            batch_string = '|'.join(task.id for task in batched_tasks)
            batch_id = hashlib.md5(batch_string.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
            
            for task in batched_tasks:
                self._state.set_batch_running(task, batch_id, worker_id)
            
            reply['task_id'] = None
            reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
            reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
            reply['task_params'] = combined_params
            reply['batch_id'] = batch_id
            reply['batch_task_ids'] = [task.id for task in batched_tasks]
        elif best_task:
            # ... existing code ...
            reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
            reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
            reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
            reply['task_params'] = best_task.params
        
        return reply
```

By making these corrections, the `batched_params` and `batch_string` construction should now yield the expected values, and the assertion error in the test case should be resolved.
