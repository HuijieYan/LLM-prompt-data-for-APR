The error occurs in the `_dict_arg` method. The error message indicates a difference in the lists due to the formatting of the dictionary values in the `command` list. The values in the dictionary are getting enclosed in double-quotes, resulting in discrepancies.

The bug occurs because when constructing `command`, the values of the dictionary are being enclosed in double-quotes, which leads to a mismatch in the comparison.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the values from the dictionary are added directly to the `command` list without any additional formatting or unnecessary characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        command.extend([name, *[f'{prop}={val}' for prop, val in value.items()]])
    return command
```

In the corrected code, the `command` list is directly extended with the formatted `name=value` pairs from the dictionary without any extra quotes or formatting. This will ensure that the values are added correctly and the comparison with the expected list will pass without errors.
