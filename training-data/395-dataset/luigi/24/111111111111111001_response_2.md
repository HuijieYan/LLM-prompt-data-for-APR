The issue in the `_dict_arg` method is that it adds unnecessary double quotes around the property-value pairs when creating the command list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that unnecessary double quotes are being added around the property-value pairs, causing a mismatch in the expected and actual values when the test cases are run.

To fix the bug, remove the unnecessary double quotes added while formatting the property-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this modification, the unnecessary double quotes issue is resolved, and the function should now return the expected command lists for the given input parameters.
