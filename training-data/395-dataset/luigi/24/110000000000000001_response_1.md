Potential Error location: The error is likely in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` as it is trying to concatenate name and the formatted string, but it should be adding them as separate elements in the list.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to concatenate the name and the formatted string using the `+=` operator, which leads to the incorrect formation of the command list.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to append the `name` and the formatted string as separate elements to the `command` list instead of concatenating them together.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Changed the variable name to "val" to avoid conflict
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))  # Appended name and formatted string separately
    return command
```
