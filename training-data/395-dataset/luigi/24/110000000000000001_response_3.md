Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the line "command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]" where the values are being added to the command list.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is intended to create a command list based on the dictionary items passed in as the 'value' parameter.
2. The bug occurs because the formatting of the command list is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use string formatting to create the command elements correctly.
2. Adjust the logic to populate the command list with the correct elements.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f'{name}="{prop}={val}"')
    return command
```
