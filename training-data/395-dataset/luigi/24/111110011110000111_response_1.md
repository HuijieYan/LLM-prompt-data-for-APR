The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected list of arguments and the actual list of arguments passed to `proc`. The difference is due to the `conf` argument being represented differently in the two lists.

Upon analysis, it appears that the `_dict_arg` function is responsible for formatting the `conf` argument incorrectly. The function currently wraps the value of `prop` in double quotes, which causes the discrepancy in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should be modified to handle the `conf` argument correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `SparkSubmitTask` class:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # Corrected _dict_arg function
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, value in value.items():
                # Handle 'conf' argument differently
                if name == "--conf":
                    command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]
                else:
                    command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
        return command
```

This modification ensures that the `conf` argument is formatted correctly without unnecessary quotes around the value part. After making this change, the test cases should pass without any discrepancies.
