Potential error location: The problem seems to be with the usage of the 'value' variable for both the input argument and the loop variable within the function.

Reasons behind the bug:
The 'value' variable is used both as an input argument and as the loop variable within the function. This can cause confusion and incorrect behavior when iterating over the dictionary items.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Rename the loop variable to something different from the input argument 'value' to avoid confusion and potential conflicts.
2. Use a different approach to construct the command list, such as using list comprehension for a more concise and clear implementation.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # renaming loop variable from 'value' to 'val'
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{}={}"'.format(key, val))
    return command
```
