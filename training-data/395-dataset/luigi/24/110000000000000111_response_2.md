Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is attempting to concatenate a list with a string, which will result in a TypeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The code is trying to create a list by concatenating a list with a string, which is not valid in Python.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can use the `append()` method to add elements to the `command` list one by one.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
