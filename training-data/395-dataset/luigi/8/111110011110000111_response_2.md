1. The test case is checking if the `S3CopyToTable.does_table_exist` function is correctly executing a SQL query. It is mocking the cursor and checking if the query is being called with the expected SQL statement.

2. The potential error location is within the `does_table_exist` function, where the SQL query is being constructed.

3. The error occurred because the SQL queries in the `does_table_exist` function are not handling case insensitivity for table names. Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive, but the queries in the function compare case sensitive table names.

4. To fix the bug, the %s string parameters in the SQL queries need to be surrounded with the `lower()` function, which will enforce case insensitivity for comparison.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
``` 

In the corrected function, the `lower()` function has been added to the table names in the SQL queries to enforce case insensitivity. This should fix the bug related to case-insensitive comparison of table names in Redshift.
