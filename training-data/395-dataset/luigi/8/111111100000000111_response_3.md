The potential error location in the problematic function is in the query string generation for checking if the table exists. The bug occurs because the table names are case insensitive in Redshift, but the comparisons in the query are case sensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to update the query to compare case insensitively and surround the %s string parameters with lower().

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
