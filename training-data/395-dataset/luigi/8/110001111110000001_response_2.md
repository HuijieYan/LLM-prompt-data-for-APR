The error occurs in the `test_s3_copy_to_table` function where it is asserting that the `mock_cursor.execute` was called with the correct arguments. It is expecting the SQL query to be "select 1 as table_exists from information_schema.tables where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1", and the arguments to be ('dummy_schema', 'dummy_table'). However, the actual call is "select 1 as table_exists from information_schema.tables where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1", ('dummy_schema', 'dummy_table').

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `does_table_exist` method. The bug is occurring in the formulation of the SQL query within the `does_table_exist` method. Depending on whether the table name has a schema prefix or not, the method constructs different SQL queries. However, the construction of the SQL query with placeholders and the actual arguments passed to `cursor.execute` do not align.

To fix the bug, the SQL query and the arguments passed to `cursor.execute` need to be adjusted based on the presence of a schema prefix in the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected version, the SQL query is formulated with placeholders for table schema and table name and then accordingly, the `cursor.execute` is called with the correct arguments based on the presence of a schema prefix in the table name.
