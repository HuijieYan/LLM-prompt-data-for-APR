Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the query construction and execution part of the code.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the PostgreSQL query is not correctly formatted and may not be executed properly.

Approach to fixing the bug: We need to fix the query construction and execution part of the code to ensure the correct PostgreSQL query is executed based on whether the table has a schema or not.

Corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            query = "select 1 as table_exists from information_schema.tables where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1"
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table.split('.')[0], self.table.split('.')[1]))
        else:
            query = "select 1 as table_exists from pg_table_def where tablename = %s limit 1"
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))

        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
In the corrected code, we have used parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and properly executed the constructed query based on the presence of a schema in the table name.
