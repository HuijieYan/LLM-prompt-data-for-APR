The potential error in the problematic function is that the SQL query is using the `lower` function for the table schema and table name comparison, but it should not. This is causing the incorrect query to be executed, which may lead to the function not detecting the existence of the table.

The bug occurred because the original function improperly used the `lower` function in the query when checking the table existence. This likely arose from a misunderstanding of the SQL syntax or the structure of the database.

To fix the bug, the `lower` function should be removed from the query so that the comparison is done directly with the table schema and name.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
