The bug might be in the query construction and execution part of the code. It seems that the table name is not being properly split when constructing the query for the "INFORMATION_SCHEMA" lookup.

The reason for the bug might be that the original code was splitting the table name only when the table contained a '.', which is not the case when querying the `information_schema` in Redshift.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the splitting logic and query construction to be correct for both scenarios (when the table contains a '.' and when it doesn't).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        schema, table = self.table.split('.')
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        schema, table = "public", self.table

    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, (schema, table))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

This corrected code includes a check for both cases: when the table name contains a '.' and when it doesn't. It correctly splits the schema and table name, constructs the query, and then executes it, thus fixing the bug.
