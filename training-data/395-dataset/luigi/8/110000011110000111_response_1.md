1. The test case is trying to verify the behavior of the `does_table_exist` function, but it is failing because the SQL query being called in the function doesn't match the expected query.

2. The potential error location is within the `does_table_exist` function where the query is being constructed and executed.

3. The bug is occurring because the SQL queries in the `does_table_exist` function are case sensitive, whereas Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive. This causes the test case to fail when comparing the expected query with the actual query executed.

4. To fix the bug, the %s string parameters in the SQL queries should be surrounded with the `lower()` function to make the comparisons case insensitive. This will ensure that the queries match the case insensitivity behavior of Redshift schema and table names.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With the corrected code, the SQL queries now use the `lower()` function to make the comparisons case insensitive, addressing the bug identified in the issue description.
