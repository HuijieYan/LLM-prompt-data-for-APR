The error message indicates that the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` function is not being executed as expected. The expected query is case insensitive, but the actual query is case sensitive.

The potential error location within the `does_table_exist` function is the construction of the SQL query.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the table names in Redshift are case insensitive, but the comparison in the SQL query is case sensitive. This results in the query not working as expected.

To fix the bug, the %s string parameters in the SQL query need to be surrounded with the `lower()` function to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
``` 

By making the comparison case insensitive using the `lower()` function, the bug in the `does_table_exist` function should be fixed.
