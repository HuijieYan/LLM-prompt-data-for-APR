Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the query construction part of the code, as there are issues with the SQL query syntax.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect construction of the SQL query. The query doesn't seem to be using the correct syntax for checking the existence of a table in Redshift.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The correct SQL query should be used to check the existence of a table in Redshift. Additionally, it seems that the code is using the 'pg_table_def' table for the case where the table name does not contain a schema, which is incorrect. The correct table to query in Redshift for this purpose is 'information_schema.tables'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
