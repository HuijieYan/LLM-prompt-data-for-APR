The error message is indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual SQL query when the `execute` method is called on the `mock_cursor` object. The expected query is using `lower(%s)` to match the schema and table name, while the actual query is using just `%s`.

The potential error location within the `does_table_exist` method is the construction of the SQL query. When '.' is present in the table name, it constructs one type of query, and for all other cases, it constructs a different type of query.

The reason for the bug is that when constructing the query, the code is not handling the case where the table name is not schema-qualified correctly.

To fix the bug, the code should modify the handling of the table name based on whether it is schema-qualified or not. If it is schema-qualified, use a query with `table_schema = lower(%s)` and `table_name = lower(%s)`; otherwise, use a query with just `tablename = lower(%s)`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            schema, table = self.table.split('.')
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
