The bug is likely in the query construction part of the code. When `.` is present in the table name, the schema and table names are formatted differently in the query.

The issue is that the query construction seems to be using `lower()` when there's a period in the table name, but the mock runtime does not reflect this implementation.

To fix the bug, it is important to check the representation of dots in table names and construct the query accordingly. Additionally, the mock should be configured to mimic this behavior.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            schema, table = self.table.split('.')
            schema = schema.lower()
            table = table.lower()
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
