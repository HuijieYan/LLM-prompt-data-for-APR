The potential error in the does_table_exist function is in the construction of the query variable. When the table name includes a schema, the query should include placeholders (%s) for both the schema and table name. However, the current code uses the lower function to transform the placeholders, which is not necessary.

To fix this bug, we should remove the lower function and adjust the query string accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the does_table_exist function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
