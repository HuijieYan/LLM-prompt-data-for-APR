The error occurs because the `mock_cursor.execute` method is called with different arguments than expected. The expected SQL query in `S3CopyToTable.does_table_exist` is not formed correctly, leading to the inconsistency between the expected and actual calls.

The bug in the `does_table_exist` function lies in the construction of the SQL query based on whether the table name contains a schema or not. The current implementation checks for '.' in the table name to determine if it contains a schema, but it fails to construct the query accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of constructing the SQL query based on whether the table name contains a schema or not. The fix requires updating the conditional block that sets the `query` variable based on the presence of a schema in the table name. In addition, we need to adjust the execute statement to handle the parameters correctly for both scenarios.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, we first split the table name into schema and table name components if it contains a schema. Then, we construct the SQL query and execute it accordingly to correctly check for the existence of the table in the database.
