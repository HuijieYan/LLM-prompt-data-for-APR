Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the SQL queries where the table and schema names are being compared. The bug is likely due to the case sensitivity of the comparison.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the SQL queries in the function does_table_exist are performing case-sensitive comparisons for table and schema names. This can lead to incorrect results when checking for table existence in Redshift, as the schema and table names are case-insensitive.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the SQL queries to perform case-insensitive comparisons for table and schema names.
2. Surround the %s string parameters with lower() to make them case-insensitive.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
