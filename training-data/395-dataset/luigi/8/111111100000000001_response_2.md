Potential error locations: 
- The query being used depends on whether the table name includes a schema name or not, but the function does not handle this properly.

Reasons behind the bug:
- The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the table name contains a schema name.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Check if the table name contains a schema name, and based on that, use different queries to check for the existence of the table.

Corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        schema_name, table_name = self.table.split('.')
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        table_name = self.table
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema_name, table_name))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (table_name,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
