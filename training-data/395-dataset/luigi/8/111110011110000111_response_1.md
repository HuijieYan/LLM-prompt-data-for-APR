The error occurs because the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method is comparing case sensitive table names instead of performing case insensitive comparisons.

The bug is occurring when comparing the table names using the `=` operator in the SQL query.

To fix the bug, we need to update the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method to use case insensitive comparisons by surrounding the `%s` string parameters with the `lower()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With the above correction, the SQL query will now perform case insensitive comparisons for table names, thus fixing the bug.
