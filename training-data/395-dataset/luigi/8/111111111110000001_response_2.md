The error is occurring when the test is trying to assert that the `execute` method of the cursor is being called with specific parameters. However, the `execute` method is being called with different parameters than expected, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location in the function `does_table_exist` where the query is being formulated based on the presence of a '.' in the table name. The query should be constructed correctly based on this condition.

The bug occurs because the 'if' condition for constructing the query based on the presence of '.' in the table name is not being applied correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function `does_table_exist` to construct the query correctly based on the condition of the table name containing '.' or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
