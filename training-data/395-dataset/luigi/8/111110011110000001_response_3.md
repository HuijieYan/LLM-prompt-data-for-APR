The test case `test_s3_copy_to_table` is checking whether the `execute` method of the cursor is called with specific arguments. This method is expected to execute the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class.

The error message reveals that the expected call to `execute` with particular arguments does not match the actual call. The arguments in the error message show that it is looking for a query with placeholders for the table schema and table name, but the actual query does not contain these placeholders.

The bug is likely occurring in the `does_table_exist` function, specifically in the construction of the `query` string. The function is choosing between two different queries based on whether the table name includes a schema (signaled by a period '.' in the table name). However, it does not properly format the query string with placeholders.

To fix the bug, the `does_table_exist` function should construct the query string correctly with placeholders for table schema and table name, and then pass the values to the `execute` method as arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the `execute` method is called with the `query` and the corresponding placeholders filled with the relevant table schema and table name. This change ensures that the correct query is constructed based on the table name and that the `execute` method is correctly called with the necessary arguments.
