The issue in the code is that the SQL query formation inside the `does_table_exist` method is incorrect. The query formed in the `if` condition is checking the table existence in the `information_schema.tables` using lower-case `table_schema` and `table_name`. However, in the case of dotted table name `"dummy_schema.dummy_table"`, the query should use the actual schema and table name without converting them to lowercase.

To fix this issue, the `if...else` condition should be modified to correctly form the SQL query based on the presence of the schema in the table name. Then, the execute statement and the `assert_called_with` statement in the test case should be updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
```

This updated code forms the correct query based on the presence of the schema in the table name.

Considering the corrected function, the test case should work without any errors.
