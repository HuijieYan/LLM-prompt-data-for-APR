The bug in the provided code is that the query being constructed for checking the existence of a table does not use case-insensitive comparison for table names. 

The reason behind the bug is that the Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive. However, the current queries in the `does_table_exist` function compare the table names in a case-sensitive manner. This can lead to incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table.

To fix this bug, the %s string parameters in the query need to be surrounded with the `lower()` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With this fix, the queries in the `does_table_exist` function will now perform case-insensitive comparisons for table names, ensuring that the table existence check works correctly.
