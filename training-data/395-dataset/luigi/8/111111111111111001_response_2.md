The problem is that the conditional statement in the `does_table_exist` function is constructed incorrectly. When the `.` is present in the table name, it should execute one type of query, and if it's not present, it should execute another type of query. However, the code currently does the opposite of what should be done.

To fix this, the conditional statements must be reversed so that the correct queries are executed based on the presence of `.` in the table name.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' not in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With this correction, the conditional logic is aligned to the condition where the correct queries should be executed based on the presence of `.` in the table name.
