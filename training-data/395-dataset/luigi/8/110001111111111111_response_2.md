The issue seems to be that the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` function is not using a case-insensitive comparison for the table names. It is using the `lower()` function in the expected test case, but not in the actual function.

To fix this bug, the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` function should use the `lower()` function to make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With this correction, the SQL query now uses the `lower()` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This should address the bug and pass the provided test case.
