The issue in the provided function `does_table_exist` is that it is not handling case sensitivity for table names in Redshift. The current query is comparing the table name without converting it to lowercase, which may lead to incorrect results. The bug can be fixed by surrounding the `%s` string parameters with `lower()` to ensure case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, the `query` string should be updated to account for case insensitivity by using the `lower()` function around the table schema and table name comparisons.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
