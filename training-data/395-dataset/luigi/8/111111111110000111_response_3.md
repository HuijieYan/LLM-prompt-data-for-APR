The error occurs in the `test_s3_copy_to_table` test function. The error message indicates that the `mock_cursor.execute.assert_called_with` assertion failed because the expected SQL query does not match the actual query.

The bug is located in the `does_table_exist` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The SQL query in this method is not handling the table names in a case-insensitive manner, while Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the SQL query to apply the `lower()` function to the table names when comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the `lower()` function is applied to the table names to ensure a case-insensitive comparison in the SQL query. This fix addresses the bug by handling the table names in a case-insensitive manner, as required by Redshift.
