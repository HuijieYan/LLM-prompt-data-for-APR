The error occurs because the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is case sensitive when comparing table names. This causes the assertion in the test case to fail because the expected SQL query is case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the %s string parameters in the SQL query need to be surrounded with the `lower()` function, making the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With this update, the SQL query now performs a case-insensitive comparison of table names, fixing the bug identified in the test case.
