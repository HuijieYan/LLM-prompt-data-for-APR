Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the query construction and comparison of table names, as well as the use of the %s string parameters without being surrounded by lower().

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the table name comparison is case sensitive, but Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive. This leads to incorrect results when checking for the existence of the table.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Surround the %s string parameters with lower() to make the comparison case insensitive.
2. Use lower() when comparing the table names to ensure case insensitivity.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
