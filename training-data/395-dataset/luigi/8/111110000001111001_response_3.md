The buggy function is `does_table_exist`. 

The error occurs because the code does not properly handle the case when `.` is present in the table name. The table name with schema should not be converted to lower case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` condition to handle the schema case properly. 

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            schema, table = self.table.split('.')
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the table name with schema is split into separate variables if `.` is present in the table name. Then, the query is executed using the appropriate variables based on whether the table name contains a schema or not.
