The error message indicates that the `assert_called_with` function is failing because it expected a different SQL query to be called with the `execute` function of the cursor. Specifically, it expected the query to use the `lower()` function to ensure that the schema and table names are in lowercase, but the execute statement used placeholders instead.

The bug occurs because the function does_table_exist is constructing the SQL query based on whether a dot '.' is present in the self.table attribute. The if-else statement inside the function is responsible for generating two different query strings; however, both queries are not using the same pattern. The queries for different table exist checks must follow the same structure to match the expectations of the test.

To fix the function, both queries should use the same pattern of formatting the query using placeholders for table and schema names instead of direct value insertion and should have lowercase comparison on table_schema and table_name for consistency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
