The potential error in the `does_table_exist` function is the query being used to check if the table exists. The query is different if the table name contains a period ('.'), which indicates a schema-qualified table name. In the first query, it checks the existence of the table in the `information_schema.tables`, and in the second query, it checks in the `pg_table_def`. 

The error is occurring because `pg_table_def` should be replaced with `information_schema.tables` in the else block of the if statement.

To fix the bug, we need to update the else block of the if statement to use the correct query.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_name = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, (self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
