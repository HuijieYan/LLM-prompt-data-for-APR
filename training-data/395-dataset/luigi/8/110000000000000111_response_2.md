Potential error location: The error is likely located in the query generation part of the code, where the comparison of table names is case sensitive.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the comparison of table names in the SQL queries is case sensitive, while Redshift schema and table names are actually case insensitive.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The table name comparison in the SQL queries needs to be made case insensitive and the %s string parameters need to be surrounded with lower().

Corrected code:
```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
