The potential error location within the problematic function is the query construction. The function checks if a dot exists in the table name, and depending on the result, constructs a different query to check if the table exists.

The bug occurred because the table schema and table name were being converted to lowercase using the "lower" function in the query. However, the tuple passed to the cursor.execute method didn't include the dot-separated table schema and table name as elements because the original code was calling self.table.split('.') in the execute method. This caused an error in the query execution.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the query construction and the tuple passed to the cursor.execute method. Removing the "lower" function and including the schema and table name correctly should resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        schema, table_name = '', self.table
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
