1. The test case is checking the SQL query in the `S3CopyToTable.does_table_exist` method. It expects the method to execute the SQL query using the `information_schema.tables` table when the table name includes a schema (i.e., contains a period '.'), and the `pg_table_def` table when the table name does not contain a schema.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional block for deciding the query to be used based on the presence of a period in the table name.

3. The bug occurs because the conditional block for selecting the appropriate query based on the presence of a schema in the table name does not consider case differences in the table name. The query construction does not account for converting the table name to lowercase when using the `information_schema.tables` table. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual SQL queries in the test case, causing the assertion error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name is transformed to lowercase when constructing the query using the `information_schema.tables` table. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the table name does not include a schema to avoid the mismatch in the queries.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    table_schema, table_name = map(str.lower, self.table.split('.')) if '.' in self.table else (None, self.table)

    if table_schema:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")

    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if table_schema:
            cursor.execute(query, (table_schema, table_name))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (table_name,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, we first extract the table schema and table name, converting the table name to lowercase if it includes a schema. We then use these values to construct and execute the appropriate SQL query, handling the lowercase transformation for the table name when necessary. This ensures that the correct SQL query is executed based on the presence of a schema in the table name, addressing the bug.
