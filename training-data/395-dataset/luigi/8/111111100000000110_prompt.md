# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Error with redshift does_table_exist()
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive (select * from TableTest; == select * from tabletest; == select * from TaBlEtEsT;). However, both queries in does_table_exist compare case sensitive table names.

These should be updated to case insensitive comparisons.

The %s string parameters need to be surrounded with lower()

It may be a few days before i can submit the PR, so feel free to beat me to it.

Thanks,
