The issue is occurring because the original function `does_table_exist` is generating a different database query based on the presence of a dot in the table name. However, as per the error message from the test function, the expected query is not being generated. The buggy function is responsible for generating the query based on the table name.

The buggy function `does_table_exist` has a conditional block that checks for a dot in the table name and then proceeds to create different SQL queries based on that condition. However, the `query` string is not being amended using the correct logic, which is leading to incorrect execution of the query.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for building the `query` string based on the table name. Additionally, the error message from the test function indicates that the query with placeholders is not formulated correctly. Hence, the correction should address this discrepancy as well.

Here's the corrected function for `does_table_exist`:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
``` 

In the corrected code:
- The `query` strings are updated based on the table name structure.
- The `execute` method is called properly, with the correct parameters based on the presence of a dot in the table name.
