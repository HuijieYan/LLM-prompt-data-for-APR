The potential error location within the problematic function is in the construction of the query variable. The comparison of table names in the query is case sensitive, which is incorrect for Redshift as it treats schema and table names as case insensitive.

The bug occurs because the query is not constructed to perform a case-insensitive comparison of schema and table names.

To fix the bug, we need to update the query to perform a case-insensitive comparison by using the lower() function around the %s string parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
