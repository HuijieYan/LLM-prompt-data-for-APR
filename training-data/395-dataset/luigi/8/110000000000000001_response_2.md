Potential error location: The error may be in the query construction based on whether there is a '.' in the table name.

Reason behind the bug: The bug is likely caused by the incorrect query construction based on whether there is a '.' in the table name. The function is checking for the existence of a table in the database, but the query construction is incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The query construction should be revised to correctly check for the existence of a table based on whether there is a '.' in the table name.

Corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_name = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, (self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
This corrected code fixes the query construction based on whether there is a '.' in the table name and also adjusts the way the table name is passed to the execute method.
