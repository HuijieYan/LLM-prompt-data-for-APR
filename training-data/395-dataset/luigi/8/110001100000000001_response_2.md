Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the SQL query construction. 

Reasons for Bug:
1. The SQL query to check for the existence of a table is not constructed properly, and it's using a different query when a schema is present in the table name.
2. The query to check for the existence of a table in a specific schema is using an incorrect table name ("pg_table_def") instead of "information_schema.tables".

Possible Approach to Fix the Bug:
1. Use the correct table name and schema to check for the existence of the table.
2. Use parameterized queries instead of string manipulation to prevent SQL injection.

Corrected Code:
```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_name = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
