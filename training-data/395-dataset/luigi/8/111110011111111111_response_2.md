The error occurs because the query in the `does_table_exist` function is using a case-sensitive comparison for table names, which is not suitable for Redshift as it treats table names as case-insensitive. The `%s` string parameters also need to be surrounded with the `lower()` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

To fix the bug, the comparison in the query should be made case-insensitive by using the `lower()` function around the table names. Additionally, the `%s` string parameters need to be surrounded with the `lower()` function as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With these changes, the comparison in the query will be case-insensitive, which aligns with the behavior of Redshift.
