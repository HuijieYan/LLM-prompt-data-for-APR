The error occurs in the `does_table_exist` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The error message indicates that the SQL query is comparing table names in a case-sensitive manner, which is incorrect for Redshift, as it treats table names as case-insensitive.

To fix this bug, the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method needs to be updated to use case-insensitive comparisons by surrounding the `%s` parameters with the `lower()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With the above changes, the SQL queries in the `does_table_exist` method will now perform case-insensitive comparisons for table names, which is the correct behavior for Redshift.
