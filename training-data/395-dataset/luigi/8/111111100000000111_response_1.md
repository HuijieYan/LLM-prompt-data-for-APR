Potential error location: 

The potential error in the provided function "does_table_exist" is the case-sensitive comparison of table names in the query.

Reason for bug occurrence:

Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive, but the queries in the function "does_table_exist" compare case sensitive table names, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Surround the %s string parameters with lower() to make the comparison case insensitive.
2. Modify the queries to use case-insensitive comparisons for table names.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected and fixed function
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
