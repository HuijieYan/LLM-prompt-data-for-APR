The error occurs because the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method is comparing the table names using a case sensitive comparison, which does not work correctly with Redshift as its schema and table names are case insensitive. The `%s` string parameters in the query also need to be surrounded with `lower()` to ensure case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method should be modified to use case insensitive comparison by surrounding the `%s` string parameters with `lower()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
        """
        Determine whether the table already exists.
        """

        if '.' in self.table:
            query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                     "from information_schema.tables "
                     "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
        else:
            query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                     "from pg_table_def "
                     "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
```

By making the modifications to the SQL query as described above, the function `does_table_exist` will now properly determine whether the table exists, taking into account the case insensitivity of Redshift schema and table names.
