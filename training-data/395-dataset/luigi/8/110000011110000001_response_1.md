The error message indicates that the `mock_cursor.execute` method is being called with different SQL queries than expected. This suggests that the `does_table_exist` function is not generating the correct SQL query based on the input table name format.

The potential error location within the `does_table_exist` function is the conditional statement that determines the format of the SQL query based on the presence of a dot in the table name.

The bug occurs because the condition for constructing the SQL query based on the presence of a dot in the table name is not correctly handling the schema-qualified table names. The condition should consider both cases, whether the table name is schema-qualified or not, and construct the query accordingly.

Approach for fixing the bug:
- Modify the conditional statement to correctly construct the SQL query based on whether the table name is schema-qualified or not.

Here's the corrected `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            # If the table name is schema-qualified
            schema_name, table_name = self.table.split('.')
            cursor.execute(query, (schema_name, table_name))
        else:
            # If the table name is not schema-qualified
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the `execute` method is called with the appropriate parameters based on whether the table name is schema-qualified or not. This ensures that the correct SQL query is generated, addressing the bug identified in the error message.
