Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `does_table_exist` function of the `Redshift` class. The error is due to the incorrect construction of the SQL query.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the SQL query construction in the `does_table_exist` function does not check for the presence of a schema when constructing the query. Additionally, the `information_schema.tables` table is not used if the table includes a schema.

Possible Approaches for fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the table name includes a schema. If it does, construct the SQL query using the `information_schema.tables` table. If not, use the `pg_table_def` table.
2. Construct the SQL query to include both the schema and table name in a way that is compatible with both tables (`information_schema.tables` and `pg_table_def`).

Corrected Code:
```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        schema_name, table_name = self.table.split('.')
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema_name, table_name))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
```
