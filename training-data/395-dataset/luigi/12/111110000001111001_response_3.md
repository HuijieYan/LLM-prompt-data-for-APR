Potential Error Location: The if statements are checking for equality of the configured client with strings, but the runtime values provided in the test cases do not match these strings, causing the function to not return any of the expected client types.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison in the if statements is not checking for the actual client type but rather comparing it to hardcoded strings.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the configured client value matches with the expected client types and then return the corresponding client type.

Corrected Code:

```python
def get_autoconfig_client(client_cache):
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = client_cache.client
    if isinstance(configured_client, hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient):
        return configured_client
    if isinstance(configured_client, hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient):
        return configured_client
    if isinstance(configured_client, hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()):
        return configured_client
    raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + str(configured_client))
```
In this corrected code, instead of comparing hardcoded strings, we are checking if the configured client is an instance of the expected client types, and then returning the configured client accordingly.
