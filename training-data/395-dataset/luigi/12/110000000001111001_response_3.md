Potential error location: The function is not correctly handling the comparison of `configured_client` to the different HDFS client types.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `configured_client` variable is being compared using the equality operator `==` to specific strings, but it seems that it should be compared as an object instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use `isinstance()` to check the type of `configured_client` and return the corresponding client.
2. Check the value of `configured_client` directly against the different types of clients using the `is` operator.
3. If the `configured_client` variable is expected to be a string, use equality comparisons with strings to handle the different cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_autoconfig_client(client_cache):
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = client_cache
    if isinstance(configured_client, str):
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        if configured_client == "snakebite":
            return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        if configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                         hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        if configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + str(configured_client))
```

This corrected code now uses the `isinstance()` function to check the type of `configured_client` and handle it accordingly. It also explicitly checks the value of `configured_client` against the different client types using the `==` operator.
