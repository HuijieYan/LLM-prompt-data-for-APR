Potential error location: The get_autoconfig_client function may not be returning the same client object each time it is called.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The get_autoconfig_client function may not be returning the same client object each time it is called, leading to instability and failure when dealing with a large number of HdfsTargets.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the get_autoconfig_client function to always return the same client object each time it is called.
2. Implement a caching mechanism to store and reuse the client object if it has already been created.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_12/luigi/contrib/hdfs/clients.py

# corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    global autoconfig_client
    if "autoconfig_client" not in globals():
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            autoconfig_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            autoconfig_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            autoconfig_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            autoconfig_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return autoconfig_client
```
In the corrected code, a global variable "autoconfig_client" is introduced to store the client object. The function checks if the client object has already been created and stored in the global variable. If it has, then it returns the stored client object. If not, it creates the client object based on the configuration and stores it in the global variable for future use. This ensures that the same client object is returned every time the function is called, preventing instability and failure when dealing with a large number of HdfsTargets.
