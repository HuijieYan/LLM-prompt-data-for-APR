The error message from the test function indicates that the original client and the client returned by the `get_autoconfig_client()` function are not the same object, resulting in an AssertionError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is that the `get_autoconfig_client()` function is returning a new client object each time it is called, rather than returning the same object.

The bug occurs because the `get_autoconfig_client()` function does not cache and return the same client object each time it is called. Instead, it creates a new client object based on the configuration every time it is invoked.

To fix the bug, the `get_autoconfig_client()` function should cache and return the same client object each time it is called. This can be achieved by storing the client object in a variable and returning it on subsequent calls without creating a new client object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client()` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'cached_client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    
    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

In the corrected code, the client object is stored as an attribute of the function itself (`get_autoconfig_client.cached_client`) and returned on subsequent calls without creating a new client object. This ensures that the same client object is returned every time the function is called, resolving the bug and addressing the AssertionError in the test case.
