The error message from the test function indicates that the original_client and the client returned by get_autoconfig_client() are not the same object, even though they should be according to the test.

The potential error location in the code is in the function get_autoconfig_client() where the client is selected based on the configuration, and there might be an issue with how the client is being returned.

The bug is occurring because the objects being compared are not the same even though they should be. This indicates that the get_autoconfig_client() function is returning a new instance of the client object each time it is called, rather than returning the same cached instance.

To fix this bug, we can modify the get_autoconfig_client() function to cache and return the same client object each time it is called.

Here's the corrected code for the get_autoconfig_client() function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_12/luigi/contrib/hdfs/clients.py

# corrected function
class AutoConfigClient:
    client = None

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if AutoConfigClient.client is not None:
        return AutoConfigClient.client

    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        AutoConfigClient.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        AutoConfigClient.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        AutoConfigClient.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        AutoConfigClient.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return AutoConfigClient.client
```

By using a class to cache the client instance, we ensure that the same client object is returned each time the function is called, fixing the bug in the original function.
