The bug seems to be related to the `get_autoconfig_client` function in the `clients.py` file, where the function is supposed to create the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.

The issue seems to be occurring when a large number of HdfsTargets are instantiated, causing the `get_autoconfig_client` function to break. The issue is likely related to the way the client object is being handled and instantiated within the function.

To fix this bug, the `get_autoconfig_client` function should be modified to consistently return the same client object each time it is called. This will ensure that the client object is reused and prevent potential issues related to instantiation of a large number of client objects.

Here's the corrected `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                             hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.client
```

In this corrected version, the `get_autoconfig_client` function uses a class attribute `client` to store the client object and ensure that the same object is returned each time the function is called. This should address the issue of the function breaking when a large number of client objects are instantiated.
