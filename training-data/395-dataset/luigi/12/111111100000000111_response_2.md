Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the instantiation of multiple HdfsTargets using the same client, leading to a failure when dealing with a large number of inputs. This suggests that the get_autoconfig_client function may not be returning the same client object each time it is called.

Reasons behind the bug: If get_autoconfig_client does not consistently return the same client object, it can lead to issues when creating a large number of HdfsTargets or clients, as seen in the test case provided. This inconsistency in client object creation can cause unexpected behavior and failure when dealing with a large number of inputs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To address the bug, the get_autoconfig_client function should be modified to consistently return the same client object each time it is called. This can be achieved by utilizing a singleton pattern, where the client object is only created once and then returned on subsequent calls.

Corrected code for the get_autoconfig_client function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'autoconfig_client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.autoconfig_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.autoconfig_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.autoconfig_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.autoconfig_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.autoconfig_client
``` 

With this correction, the get_autoconfig_client function will create the client object only once and then return the same object on subsequent calls, addressing the issue of inconsistency in client object creation.
