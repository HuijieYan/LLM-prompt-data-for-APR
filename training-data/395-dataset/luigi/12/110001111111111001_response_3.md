The error is occurring because the `get_autoconfig_client()` function is returning a new instance of the client every time it is called, rather than using the cached client as intended.

The potential error location is the logic that selects the client based on the configured client type.

The bug is occurring because the function is not utilizing the thread-local cache as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to utilize the thread-local cache to store and retrieve the client.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client()` function:

```python
from threading import local

_client_cache = local()

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(_client_cache, "client"):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            _client_cache.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            _client_cache.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            _client_cache.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                         hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            _client_cache.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return _client_cache.client
```
