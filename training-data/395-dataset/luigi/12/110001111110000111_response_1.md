The test case `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` calls the function `get_autoconfig_client` and compares the original client with the client returned by the function within a loop. The error message indicates that the original client and the client returned by the function are not the same, even though they should be.

The potential error location within the `get_autoconfig_client` function is that it's returning a new client object every time it's called, instead of returning the same client object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `get_autoconfig_client` is creating a new client object every time it's called, leading to the comparison failure in the test.

To fix the bug, the function should return the same client object every time it's called. This can be achieved by creating a singleton pattern within the function, ensuring that only one instance of the client is created and returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function with the singleton pattern implemented:

```python
# corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'client_instance'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return get_autoconfig_client.client_instance
```

With this correction, the function `get_autoconfig_client` will now return the same client instance every time it's called, ensuring that the comparison in the test case will pass.
