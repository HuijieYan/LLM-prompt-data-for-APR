The test case is comparing the result of `get_autoconfig_client()` 100 times with `original_client`, and it is failing with an AssertionError. The error message indicates that the two objects being compared are not the same, even though they should be.

The potential error in the code can be seen in the `get_autoconfig_client()` function. The issue seems to be that the function is not returning the same client object each time it is called, leading to the assertion failure in the test case.

The reason behind the bug is that the function `get_autoconfig_client()` is not returning the same client object for subsequent calls. This is likely due to the way client objects are instantiated and returned within the function.

To fix the bug, the `get_autoconfig_client()` function should be modified to return the same client object each time it is called. This can be done by caching the client object and returning the cached object for subsequent calls.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client()` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, "cached_client") or get_autoconfig_client.cached_client is None:
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

By using a cached client object and returning the cached object for subsequent calls to `get_autoconfig_client()`, we ensure that the same client object is returned each time the function is called. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
