The error message from the test function indicates that the original client is not being cached and reused as expected. This suggests that the `get_autoconfig_client` function is not returning the same object each time it is called.

The potential error location within the function is the multiple return statements that create new instances of the client based on the configured type, without any caching mechanism.

The reason for the bug is that the function is creating a new client instance each time it is called, even if the configured client type is the same. This causes the test to fail when checking if the original client is the same as the one returned by subsequent calls.

To fix this bug, we can implement a caching mechanism within the function to ensure that the client is only created once and then reused for subsequent calls.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'cached_client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
   
    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

In the corrected function, we have added a check to see if the `cached_client` attribute exists on the function itself. If it does not exist, we create the client based on the configured type and store it as the `cached_client` attribute. Subsequent calls to the function will then return the cached client without creating a new instance each time. This ensures that the original client is cached and reused as expected.
