The potential error in the provided function `get_autoconfig_client` lies in the comparison of the `configured_client` with different string values and returning different types of client objects based on the comparison result.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function returns different client objects based on the `configured_client` value, which can lead to inconsistencies in the client object being used in different parts of the code.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to always return the same type of client object irrespective of the `configured_client` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()

    if configured_client in ["webhdfs", "snakebite", "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback"]:
        return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()

    if configured_client in ["hadoopcli"]:
        return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()

    raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```

In the corrected code, we always return an instance of `hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()` for `webhdfs`, `snakebite`, and `snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback` configurations, and we return an instance of `hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()` for the `hadoopcli` configuration.

By always returning the same type of client object, we ensure consistency in the client being used throughout the code.
