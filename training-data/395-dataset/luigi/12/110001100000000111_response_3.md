The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_autoconfig_client()` function. The issue seems to be related to the creation of multiple instances of clients, which may lead to errors when dealing with a large number of objects.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_autoconfig_client()` function is creating a new client instance every time it is called. This can lead to resource exhaustion or other issues when dealing with a large number of objects, as seen in the test case provided.

To fix the bug, the `get_autoconfig_client()` function can be modified to return the same client object each time it is called. This can be achieved by using a static variable to store the client object and returning it when the function is called.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client()` function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, "client"):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.client
```
