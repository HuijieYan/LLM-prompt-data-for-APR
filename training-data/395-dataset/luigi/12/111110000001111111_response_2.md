The error seems to be related to the `get_autoconfig_client` function, which is responsible for creating the client based on the configuration mentioned in `luigi.cfg`.

The potential error location in the function is the comparison of `configured_client` with different string values. 

The error occurs because the `configured_client` value is not being set correctly from the input parameter `client_cache` in both test cases. The function should be setting `configured_client` based on the value of the input parameter `client_cache`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly set the value of `configured_client` based on the input parameter `client_cache`. This will ensure that the correct client is returned based on the configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client(client_cache):
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = client_cache.client  # Assuming client_cache is an object with a client attribute
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    if configured_client == "snakebite":
        return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    if configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    if configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```

With this fix, the `configured_client` will be set based on the input parameter `client_cache`, and the correct client will be returned based on the configuration.
