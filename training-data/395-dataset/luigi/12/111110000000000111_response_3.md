Potential error location: The function get_autoconfig_client() is returning a new client object every time it is called, which could lead to the creation of multiple client objects when called repeatedly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function is creating a new client object each time it is called, which can lead to excessive resource usage and potential instability when dealing with large numbers of targets.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Modify the function to return the same client object each time it is called, ensuring that only one client object is used for all targets.
2. Use a global variable to store the client object and return it when the function is called, ensuring the same client object is used consistently.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
configured_client = None

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    global configured_client
    if configured_client:
        return configured_client

    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    if configured_client == "snakebite":
        return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    if configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    if configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    
    raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```

By using a global variable to store the client object and returning it when the function is called, the corrected code ensures that the same client object is used consistently, preventing the creation of multiple client objects and addressing the resource usage and instability issues related to the original bug.
