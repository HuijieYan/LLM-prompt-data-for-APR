The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of `configured_client` against different strings without confirming its type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the type of the `configured_client` variable, which leads to the comparison not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `configured_client` is of type string and then compare its value against strings.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if isinstance(configured_client, str):
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        if configured_client == "snakebite":
            return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        if configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                         hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        if configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + str(configured_client))
```
