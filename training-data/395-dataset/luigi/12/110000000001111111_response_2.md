The potential error in the provided function `get_autoconfig_client()` is that it returns a new instance of the client object each time it is called. This can lead to excessive resource consumption, especially when the function is called in a loop or with a large number of iterations, as seen in the GitHub issue.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not re-use the same client object if it has been previously instantiated. This can lead to resource exhaustion and performance issues, as observed in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the `get_autoconfig_client()` function should return the same client object each time it is called, ensuring that resources are not unnecessarily consumed.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client()` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Returns the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration. 
    If the client has been previously instantiated, it returns the existing instance.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                         hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    
    return get_autoconfig_client.client
```

In the corrected code, the function uses a class attribute (`client`) to store the instantiated client object. It checks if the client has been previously instantiated and returns the existing instance if it exists. This approach ensures that resources are not needlessly consumed and resolves the issue described in the GitHub report.
