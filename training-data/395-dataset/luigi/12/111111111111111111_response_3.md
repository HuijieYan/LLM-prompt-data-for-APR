The test case is checking whether the original client object returned by the `get_autoconfig_client` function is the same as the client object returned by subsequent calls to the `get_autoconfig_client` function. The error message indicates that the original client object is not the same as the client object returned by the subsequent calls, which is unexpected.

The potential error location within the `get_autoconfig_client` function is the lack of a mechanism to cache and return the same client object for subsequent calls.

The bug occurs because the `get_autoconfig_client` function does not cache the client object and returns a new client object for each call. As a result, the test case fails when it compares the original client object with the client object returned by subsequent calls.

To fix the bug, the `get_autoconfig_client` function should cache and return the same client object for subsequent calls. This can be achieved by implementing a caching mechanism using a global variable or a memoization decorator.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
import functools

# Add a caching mechanism using a memoization decorator
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    if configured_client == "snakebite":
        return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    if configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    if configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```

The `functools.lru_cache` decorator is used to cache the return values of the function, so subsequent calls with the same input parameters will return the cached result. This ensures that the same client object is returned for subsequent calls to the `get_autoconfig_client` function.
