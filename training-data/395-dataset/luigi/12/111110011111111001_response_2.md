The error occurs because the `get_autoconfig_client` function is returning a new instance of the client object every time it's called, instead of returning the same instance when it's called repeatedly.

The potential error location is within the `get_autoconfig_client` function, particularly in the logic where different client types are being checked and returned.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle caching of the client properly, resulting in the creation of a new client object instance each time the function is called.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to cache the client object and return the same cached object when the function is called. This way, the same client instance is returned every time.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
import threading

# Create thread-local storage for caching the client
client_cache = threading.local()

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    # Check if the client is already cached
    if hasattr(client_cache, 'client'):
        return client_cache.client
    
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        client_cache.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    
    return client_cache.client
```

This corrected code introduces a thread-local cache to store the client object. When the function is called, it first checks if the client is already cached. If not, the appropriate client is created, cached, and then returned. This ensures that the same client instance is returned every time the function is called, addressing the issue identified in the test and the error message.
