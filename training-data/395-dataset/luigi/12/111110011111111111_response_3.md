The issue seems to be related to the `get_autoconfig_client` function not returning the same object each time it is called, which is causing the `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` test to fail. The test is expecting the same object to be returned for multiple calls to `get_autoconfig_client`, but it is failing due to the function returning different objects.

The `get_autoconfig_client` function seems to be returning different instances of the client based on the configured client type, which causes the test to fail when it compares the original client with the client returned by the function.

To fix this issue, the `get_autoconfig_client` function should return the same client object each time it is called. This can be achieved by caching the client object and returning the cached object on subsequent calls.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# Corrected function
# Cache variable to store the client
_cached_client = None

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    global _cached_client

    if _cached_client:
        return _cached_client

    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        _cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        _cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        _cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        _cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return _cached_client
```

By caching the client object and returning the cached object on subsequent calls, the `get_autoconfig_client` function will now consistently return the same client object, which should fix the failing test case.
