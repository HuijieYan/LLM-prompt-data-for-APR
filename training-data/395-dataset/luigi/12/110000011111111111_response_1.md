The error in the buggy function is likely caused by the get_autoconfig_client() function returning a new instance of the client object every time it is called, rather than reusing the same instance as expected. This can result in the AssertionError when comparing the original_client with the result of get_autoconfig_client() in the test case.

To fix this, the get_autoconfig_client() function should be modified to return the same client instance each time it is called. This can be achieved by using a caching mechanism to store and return the client instance.

Here's the corrected code for the get_autoconfig_client() function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
import threading

# Cache for storing the client instance
client_cache = threading.local()

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(client_cache, 'client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            client_cache.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            client_cache.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            client_cache.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            client_cache.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return client_cache.client
```

By using the threading.local() object, we can ensure that the client instance is stored and retrieved within the same thread, thereby returning the same instance each time get_autoconfig_client() is called. This should solve the issue observed in the test case.
