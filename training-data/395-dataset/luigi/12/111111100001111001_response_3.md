The buggy function `get_autoconfig_client()` is supposed to create an HDFS client based on the configuration specified in `luigi.cfg`. The function checks the configured client and returns the appropriate client instance based on the configuration. The bug seems to be related to the failure to identify the configured client correctly.

The potential error location within the function is the comparison of `configured_client` with different types of clients. It seems like the comparison is not working correctly, resulting in the wrong client being selected.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the correct comparison method to check the value of `configured_client` and return the corresponding HDFS client instance based on the configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```
