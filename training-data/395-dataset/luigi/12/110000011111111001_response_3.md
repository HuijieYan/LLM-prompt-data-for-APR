The error is occurring because the `get_autoconfig_client` function is not returning the same instance of the client for each call, even though the test is asserting that it should.

The potential error location within the function is the logic that determines which client to return based on the configured client type. This logic is not ensuring that the same instance of the client is returned for each call.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is creating a new instance of the client for each call, rather than returning a cached instance. This is inconsistent with the expectations of the test.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to use a cache to store the client instances and return the cached instance when the function is called multiple times with the same configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
import threading

# Initialize a thread-local cache to store the client instances
client_cache = threading.local()

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    # Check if the client instance is already cached
    if hasattr(client_cache, 'client') and client_cache.configured_client == hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client():
        return client_cache.client

    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        client_cache.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    # Cache the configured client type
    client_cache.configured_client = configured_client

    return client_cache.client
```

With this modification, the function now caches the client instance based on the configured client type and returns the cached instance for subsequent calls with the same configuration. This will ensure that the test `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` passes as expected.
