1. The test function `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` is trying to verify if the `get_autoconfig_client` function returns the same object for multiple invocations. However, the test is failing with an AssertionError, indicating that the function is returning different objects instead of the same one.

2. The potential error location within the `get_autoconfig_client` function is the logic for returning different client objects based on the configured client type.

3. The reason behind the bug is that the `get_autoconfig_client` function is not returning the same client object for multiple invocations. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in scenarios where the client state or configuration is expected to be consistent across invocations.

4. To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the `get_autoconfig_client` function to return the same client object for multiple invocations. This can be achieved by implementing a caching mechanism within the function to return a cached client object if it exists, or create a new client object and cache it for subsequent invocations.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'cached_client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

In the corrected code, a `cached_client` attribute is added to the `get_autoconfig_client` function to store the client object. When the function is called, it first checks if the cached client object exists. If it does, the cached client object is returned. If not, a new client object is created based on the configured client type, cached, and then returned. This ensures that the same client object is returned for multiple invocations of the function.
