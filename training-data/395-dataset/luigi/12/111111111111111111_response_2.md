The error message from the test function indicates that the `get_autoconfig_client` function is returning different objects (HdfsClient) each time it is called within the loop. However, the test expects the original client and the client returned by the function to be the same object.

The potential error is occurring within the `get_autoconfig_client` function, where different clients are being created based on the configured client type.

The reason behind the bug is that the `get_autoconfig_client` function is not returning the same client object each time it is called, resulting in the test failure.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to modify the `get_autoconfig_client` function to return the same client object when called multiple times. This can be achieved by implementing a caching mechanism to store and return the client object if it has already been created.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function with an added caching mechanism:

```python
import threading

# Create a thread-local storage for storing the client object
client_cache = threading.local()

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if hasattr(client_cache, 'client'):
        # Return the cached client object if it exists
        return client_cache.client

    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        client_cache.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        client_cache.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return client_cache.client
```

With this modification, the `get_autoconfig_client` function should now return the same client object each time it is called, which will resolve the test failure.
