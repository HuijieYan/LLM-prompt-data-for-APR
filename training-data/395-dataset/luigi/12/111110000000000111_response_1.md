The potential error in the `get_autoconfig_client` function is that it is not returning the same client object each time, which could be causing issues with repeated instantiation of clients.

The bug occurs when a large number of HdfsTargets or AutoConfigClients are instantiated in a loop using list comprehensions, which may lead to the bug manifesting itself after a certain threshold (around 1000 in this case).

To fix the bug, the `get_autoconfig_client` function should always return the same client object each time it is called. This can be achieved by using a singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the client object is created and returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'client_instance'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                         hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.client_instance
```

In this corrected code, the `get_autoconfig_client` function uses the singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the client object is created and returned. The client object is stored as an attribute of the function itself, and it is only created if it does not already exist. This ensures that the same client object is returned every time the function is called, eliminating the issue of multiple client instantiations.
