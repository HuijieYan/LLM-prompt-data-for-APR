The current code seems to have issues with the expected results of the test cases and their actual results. The test_failure and test_processing_time_handler_failure functions are failing due to the expected output not matching the actual output.

Upon further analysis, it appears that the `_run_get_new_deps` method is not returning any values, which is causing the status to be set as `FAILED`. This is leading to the failures in the test cases.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the `_run_get_new_deps` method returns the correct values and that the status is set accordingly based on the results returned by this method.

Here's the corrected function for the `run` method:

```python
def run(self):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    try:
        new_deps = self._run_get_new_deps()
        if new_deps is None or len(new_deps) == 0:
            status = RUNNING
        else:
            status = SUSPENDED
            logger.info(
                '[pid %s] Worker %s new requirements      %s',
                os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
            return
    finally:
        if status != SUSPENDED:
            self.task.trigger_event(
                Event.PROCESSING_TIME, self.task, time.time() - t0)
            error_message = json.dumps(self.task.on_success())
            logger.info('[pid %s] Worker %s done      %s', os.getpid(),
                        self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
            self.task.trigger_event(Event.SUCCESS, self.task)
            status = DONE

    # ... (omitted code) ...
```

In this corrected code, I've added a check to verify if `new_deps` is either `None` or an empty list, and set the `status` accordingly. This change should resolve the issues with the test cases failing due to incorrect results.
