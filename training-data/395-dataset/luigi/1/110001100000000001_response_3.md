Potential error location: The line "metrics.configure_http_handler(self)" is likely to cause an error as the metrics object may not have a method called "configure_http_handler".

Reason for the bug: The "configure_http_handler" method is not a standard method for the metrics object, so calling this method on the metrics object will result in an AttributeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of calling "configure_http_handler" on the metrics object, the appropriate action should be to configure the HTTP handler for the server itself, not the metrics object.

Corrected code:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._http_handler.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
