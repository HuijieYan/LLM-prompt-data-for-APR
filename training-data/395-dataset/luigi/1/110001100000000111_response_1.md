Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the metrics collector not having a callback to configure the http handler, leading to a breaking change in the server.py.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The introduction of a dependency on prometheus_client in PR #2628 caused a breaking change in the server.py, as there was no callback for the metrics collector to further customize the http handler.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The fix involves adding a callback for the metrics collector to customize the http handler, as described in the issue description.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# Updated function with added callback for metrics collector
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
