The issue in the provided code is that it is trying to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object. However, the `configure_http_handler` method is not a method of the `metrics` object, but rather a method of the `metrics_collector` object.

The reason behind this bug is that the `configure_http_handler` method is being called on the wrong object. The correct approach is to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics_collector` object, not on the `metrics` object.

To fix this bug, the correct code for the `get` function should be as follows:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

By making this change, the `configure_http_handler` method will be called on the `metrics_collector` object instead of the `metrics` object, resolving the bug.
