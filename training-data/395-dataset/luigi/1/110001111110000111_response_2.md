Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the `configure_http_handler` method of the `MetricsCollector` class. The `assert_called_once_with` method in the test case is trying to ensure that `configure_http_handler` is called once, but it is not being called at all in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the missing call to `configure_http_handler` in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class to call the `configure_http_handler` method of the `MetricsCollector` class.
2. Ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is properly configured to be called from the `get` method.
3. Review the changes introduced in issue #2628 to understand the impact on the `get` method and metrics handling.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# corrected get method
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        handler = metrics.configure_http_handler()
        self.write(metrics)
```

By making these changes, the `configure_http_handler` method is called from the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class, addressing the issue identified in the test case.
