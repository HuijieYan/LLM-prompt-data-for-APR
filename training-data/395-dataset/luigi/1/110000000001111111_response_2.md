The potential error in the buggy function is that the `generate_latest()` method is being called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`, but the returned value is not being utilized or assigned to any variable before calling `configure_http_handler()`.

The buggy function is trying to generate the latest metrics and then configure the HTTP handler, but it is not using the returned metrics object for configuration.

To fix this issue, the returned metrics object should be stored in a variable and then used to configure the HTTP handler.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

In the corrected code, the `metrics_collector.generate_latest()` is stored in the `metrics` variable, and then it is used to configure the HTTP handler and write the metrics.
