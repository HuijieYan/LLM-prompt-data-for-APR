The buggy function is attempting to get metrics from the `_metrics_collector` and then configure the HTTP handler and write the metrics. However, there are several issues in the function:

1. The `generate_latest()` method is being called on `_metrics_collector`, which is returning a MagicMock instead of the actual metrics.
2. The `configure_http_handler()` method is being called on the metrics object itself, which is incorrect.

To fix the function, we need to call `generate_latest()` on `_metrics_collector` to get the actual metrics and then call `configure_http_handler()` on the metrics object. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
