The error occurs because the `configure_http_handler` method of the `metrics` object is not being called in the buggy function's `get` method. Additionally, the `generate_latest` method of `metrics_collector` is not being called correctly.

The potential error location is within the `get` method of the buggy function, where the `metrics` object is being used but not properly configured and written.

The bug is occurring because the `generate_latest` method is being called on `metrics_collector` directly, instead of on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`. Additionally, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on the `metrics` object before writing the metrics.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `generate_latest` method is called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`, and the `configure_http_handler` method is called on the `metrics` object before writing the metrics.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

This code ensures that the `generate_latest` method is called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` and that the `configure_http_handler` method is called on the `metrics` object before writing the metrics.
