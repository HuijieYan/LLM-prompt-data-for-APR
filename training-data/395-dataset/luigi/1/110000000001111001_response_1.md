The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to access the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object, which is not a method of `metrics`. Instead, it should be called directly on `metrics_collector`. Additionally, the function should only execute `write` if `metrics` is not None. 

The corrected code for the function is:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
