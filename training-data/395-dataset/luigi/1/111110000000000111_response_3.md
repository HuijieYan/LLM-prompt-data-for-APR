The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to configure an HTTP handler directly from the metrics collector, which is not the correct approach. The metrics collector should have a callback to configure the HTTP handler.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurred because the function is trying to directly configure the HTTP handler from the metrics collector without using a proper callback.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a callback to the metrics collector to configure the HTTP handler.
2. Use the callback to properly configure the HTTP handler from the metrics collector.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            # Assuming there is a callback method in metrics_collector to configure the HTTP handler
            metrics.configure_http_handler_callback(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```
