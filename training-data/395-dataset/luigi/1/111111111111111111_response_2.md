The error message indicates that the function `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it was not called at all. This suggests that there is an issue with the `get` function in the `MetricsHandler` class, specifically with the `metrics_collector.generate_latest` and `metrics_collector.configure_http_handler` calls.

The reason behind this bug could be that the `generate_latest` function may not be returning the expected `mock_metrics` value, resulting in the `configure_http_handler` function not being called as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `generate_latest` function returns the `mock_metrics` value, and then call the `configure_http_handler` function with the `self` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        mock_metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if mock_metrics:
            mock_metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(mock_metrics)
```

In this corrected code, we are explicitly storing the result of `generate_latest` in `mock_metrics`, and then calling the `configure_http_handler` function with `self` as the parameter.

This should address the issue and ensure that the `configure_http_handler` function is called as expected in the test case.
