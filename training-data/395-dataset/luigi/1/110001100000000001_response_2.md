The potential error in the provided function is that it is missing the `self.finish()` method to complete the HTTP request cycle. This means that the response will not be sent back to the client, resulting in incomplete or hanging requests.

To fix this bug, we need to add the `self.finish()` method at the end of the function to complete the HTTP request cycle and send the response back to the client.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
    self.finish()
```
