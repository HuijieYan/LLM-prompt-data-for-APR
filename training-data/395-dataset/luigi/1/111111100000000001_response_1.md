Potential error:

The error in the code is that the `generate_latest` method is being called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`, but it seems that the `generate_latest` method is not present in the `metrics_collector` object.

Reason behind the bug:

The bug occurred due to the incorrect usage of the `generate_latest` method. It seems that the intention was to generate the latest metrics, but the method is not being called on the correct object.

Approach for fixing the bug:

We need to identify the correct object that has the `generate_latest` method to retrieve the latest metrics.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state.metrics_collector.generate_latest()  # Assuming the correct object is 'metrics_collector'
        if metrics:
            self.write(metrics)
```
In the corrected code, I assumed that the `generate_latest` method is present in the `metrics_collector` object and made the necessary adjustment to call the method on the correct object.
