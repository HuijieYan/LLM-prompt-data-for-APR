The buggy function `get` is trying to access and write metrics from the `_metrics_collector` attribute of `_state` of a `MetricsHandler` instance. However, the MagicMock objects are being used instead of actual instances. 

To fix this, we need to make sure that `self._scheduler` and its attributes are properly configured with the actual instances of the required classes and that the `metrics_collector` is a valid instance of the `MetricsCollector` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

In this corrected code, we assume that the `_scheduler`, `_state`, and `_metrics_collector` attributes are properly initialized with the actual instances of the required classes. Then, we directly access the `generate_latest` and `configure_http_handler` methods of the `metrics_collector` instance to generate and write the metrics.
