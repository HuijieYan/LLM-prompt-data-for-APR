The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. This is causing the error because the `configure_http_handler` method is not available in the `metrics` object.

To fix this bug, we need to add a callback to the metrics collector to further customize the HTTP handler. By adding a callback, we can customize the HTTP handler without directly exposing it to contrib.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.add_http_handler(self.application)
            self.write(metrics)
```

By using `add_http_handler` method, we can add a callback to the metrics collector to configure the HTTP handler without directly exposing it. This will fix the bug and allow for further customization of the HTTP handler.
