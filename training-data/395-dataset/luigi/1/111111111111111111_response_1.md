The error message from the test function indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` of `self.mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` was expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called as expected, possibly due to incorrect usage or missing implementation.

To fix the bug, the `configure_http_handler` method needs to be called with the appropriate arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...
        
    # the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

By including the correct call to `configure_http_handler` in the `get` method, the bug should be fixed and the test case should pass as expected.
