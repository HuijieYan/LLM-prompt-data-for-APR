Potential error location: 

The `configure_http_handler` method is being called on `metrics`, which is most likely a mistake. It should be called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The `configure_http_handler` method is being called on an object that doesn't have this method, leading to the AssertionError in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Change the call to `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` to `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
