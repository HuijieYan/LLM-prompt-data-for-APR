The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object, which is not a valid operation.

The reason for the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on the `PrometheusMetricsCollector` object, not on the `metrics` object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to call `configure_http_handler` on the `PrometheusMetricsCollector` object and then write the metrics data to the response.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        if metrics_collector:
            metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
            self.write(metrics)
```

In the fixed code, we first retrieve the `metrics_collector` object from the `_scheduler` and then call the `configure_http_handler` method on it. After that, we generate the latest metrics and write them to the response.
