Potential error location:
The error in the given function is that it is attempting to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object, which is not a valid operation. It seems like `metrics` should actually be an instance of a class that has the `configure_http_handler` and `write` methods.

Reason for the bug:
The `metrics` object is not being instantiated properly, or the method `generate_latest()` is not returning an object with the required methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `generate_latest()` method returns an object with the `configure_http_handler` and `write` methods.
2. Instantiate the `metrics` object as an instance of a class that has the `configure_http_handler` and `write` methods.

Corrected code:
```python
def get(self):
    metrics_data = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics_data:
        metrics = Metrics()  # Instantiate Metrics class with the metrics data
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
In the corrected code, I assumed that `Metrics` is a class that has the necessary methods, and we instantiate this class with the metrics data obtained from the `_metrics_collector.generate_latest()` method. Then we can call the required methods on the `metrics` object.
