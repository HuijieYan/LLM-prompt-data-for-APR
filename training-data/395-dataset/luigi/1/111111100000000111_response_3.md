Potential error location: The error is likely occurring because the `metrics` object does not have a method called `configure_http_handler`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `self.write(metrics)` line is trying to configure an HTTP handler on the `metrics` object, but the `metrics` object does not have a method called `configure_http_handler`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to modify the `metrics` object to include a `configure_http_handler` method so that it can be called in the `get` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...


    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            self.write(metrics.render())
```

In this corrected code, we are calling the `render` method on the `metrics` object instead of trying to configure an HTTP handler. This should allow the `get` function to properly output the metrics.
