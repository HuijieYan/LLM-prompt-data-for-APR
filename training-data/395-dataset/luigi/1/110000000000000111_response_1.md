Potential error location: The issue seems to indicate that the metrics collector needs a callback to configure the http handler, but the existing code does not include such a callback.

Reason for the bug: The existing code does not provide a way to configure the http handler for the metrics collector, leading to a mismatch with the requirements mentioned in the issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a callback function to the metrics collector class for configuring the http handler.
2. Modify the get() function to use the callback function from the metrics collector to configure the http handler.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        handler_callback = metrics.get_http_handler_callback()
        if handler_callback:
            handler_callback(self)  # configure http handler
        self.write(metrics)
```
