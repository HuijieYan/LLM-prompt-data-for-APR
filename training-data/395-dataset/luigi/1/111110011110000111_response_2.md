The error message points to the assertion that `configure_http_handler` method of `self.mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` was expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times.

The potential error location within the `get` method is the line:
```python
metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` method is being called on the `metrics` object returned by `generate_latest`, which is incorrect. It should be called directly on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `_metrics_collector` object itself. Also, we need to pass the `self` as an argument to the `generate_latest` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest(self)
        if metrics:
            metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

By making these changes, we are now calling the `generate_latest` method with `self` as an argument, and then calling the `configure_http_handler` method on the `_metrics_collector` object to configure the http handler.
