The error message indicates that the `configure_http_handler` function of `self.mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` was expected to be called once but was called 0 times. This points to a potential issue within the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class where the `configure_http_handler` function is not being called as expected.

The bug in the provided function `get` is that after obtaining the metrics data and checking if it exists, it tries to configure the HTTP handler using `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. However, the `metrics` object should have a method called `configure_http_handler`, but it is being called directly. This could be the reason why the `configure_http_handler` function is not being called as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` is an object with a method `generate_latest()` that returns an object with a method `configure_http_handler()`. Then call the `configure_http_handler` on the metrics object before writing it.

The corrected code for the `get` method is shown below:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            http_handler = metrics.configure_http_handler()
            http_handler.write(metrics)
```

In the corrected code, the `configure_http_handler` function is called on the `metrics` object to obtain the HTTP handler, and then the `write` function is called on the HTTP handler with the metrics data as the parameter.
