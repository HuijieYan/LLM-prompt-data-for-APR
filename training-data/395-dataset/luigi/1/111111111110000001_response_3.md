The error message indicates that the function `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once but it was called 0 times. This suggests that the `configure_http_handler` is not being called in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
```

The reason for the bug is that the function is attempting to call `configure_http_handler` from the `metrics` object without checking if it actually exists, leading to a potential AttributeError. Additionally, the correct method to call `configure_http_handler` is from the `_metrics_collector` attribute, not directly from the `metrics` object.

To fix this bug:
1. First, we need to check if `configure_http_handler` exists in `metrics` before calling it.
2. If it exists, we should call it from the `_metrics_collector` attribute instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        if hasattr(metrics, 'configure_http_handler'):
            metrics._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

With this correction, the `configure_http_handler` method is checked for existence before calling it, and if it exists, it is called from the `_metrics_collector` attribute.
