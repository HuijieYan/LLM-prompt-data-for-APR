The error message indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times. This suggests that the problematic function `get` is not calling `configure_http_handler` as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
```

This line is attempting to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object, but it should actually be called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`.

The bug occurred because the `configure_http_handler` method is being called on the `metrics` object instead of the `_metrics_collector` object.

To fix this issue, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

With this correction, the `get` method will now call the `configure_http_handler` method on the correct object, and the test case should no longer encounter the assertion error.
