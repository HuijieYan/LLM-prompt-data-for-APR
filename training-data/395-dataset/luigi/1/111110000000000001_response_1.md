Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is at the line "metrics.configure_http_handler(self)" as it seems to be attempting to call a method on the metrics object that may not exist, causing the function to fail.

Reasons for Bug:
The metrics object may not have a method called "configure_http_handler", which would cause a runtime error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the "configure_http_handler" method exists on the metrics object before calling it.
2. Use a try-except block to handle any potential errors that may occur when calling the method.

Corrected Code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            if hasattr(metrics, 'configure_http_handler'):
                metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
                self.write(metrics)
            else:
                # handle the case where configure_http_handler method is not available
                self.set_status(500)
                self.write("Internal Server Error")
        else:
            # handle the case where metrics is not available
            self.set_status(404)
            self.write("Metrics not found")
```
