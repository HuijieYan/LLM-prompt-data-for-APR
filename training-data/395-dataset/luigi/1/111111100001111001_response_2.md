The potential error in the given function is that the `generate_latest` method is not being called correctly on the `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` object. It seems that the `metrics_collector` object is a MagicMock, so calling `generate_latest()` should be done without the parentheses at the end.

The reason behind the bug is that the `generate_latest` method is being incorrectly called with parentheses, which is not how MagicMock objects are usually called.

To fix this bug, we should remove the parentheses when calling the `generate_latest` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```
