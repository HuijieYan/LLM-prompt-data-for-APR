Potential Error Location: 

The buggy function get() is attempting to use the _scheduler variable, but it may not have been properly initialized or passed as a parameter to the function.

Reasons for the Bug: 

The _scheduler variable may not have been initialized correctly, or it may be using the wrong reference.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the _scheduler variable is properly initialized before calling the get() function.
2. Check the code where the MetricsHandler class is instantiated to make sure the _scheduler variable is assigned correctly.

Corrected Code:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self, scheduler):
        metrics = scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

In the corrected code, the get() function now takes an additional parameter "scheduler" to ensure that the _scheduler variable is passed to the function when it is called. This ensures that the function has access to the necessary instance variables.
