The error message from the test function indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method of `self.mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` was expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` line. This line is incorrect because `metrics` is a MagicMock object and does not have a `configure_http_handler` method. Instead, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`.

The bug occurred because the `configure_http_handler` method was incorrectly called on the `metrics` object, which is a MagicMock and does not have this method. Additionally, the `generate_latest` method was not being called on the `metrics_collector`.

To fix this bug, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` and the `generate_latest` method should be called on `metrics_collector`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

With these changes, the `configure_http_handler` method will be called on the correct object, and the `generate_latest` method will be called on `metrics_collector`. This should resolve the bug.
