The problematic function 'get' is attempting to access the metrics collector and write the metrics to the response, but it is encountering an error due to incorrect usage of MagicMock objects.

The potential error is in the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. The `configure_http_handler` is being incorrectly accessed as a method of the `metrics` object, but it should actually be accessed as a method of the `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` object.

The bug occurred because `metrics` is a MagicMock object representing the result of `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()`. Without correct configuration and method calls, MagicMock objects do not behave like actual objects and can cause errors.

To fix the bug, we should call `configure_http_handler` method on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` and pass `self` as the argument.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get' method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
