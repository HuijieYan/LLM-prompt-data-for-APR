The potential error location within the problematic function is the `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` line. It seems that the `configure_http_handler` method is expected to be called, but it's not being called in the `get` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` is not being called after getting the metrics data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called after getting the metrics data.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self.write(metrics)
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
```

By moving the `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` statement below the `self.write(metrics)` statement, we ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called after getting the metrics data. This should fix the bug and address the error message from the test function.
