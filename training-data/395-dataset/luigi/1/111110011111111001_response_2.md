The error message indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method of `metrics_collector` is called 0 times, while the test expects it to be called once. This implies that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called as expected in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

The potential error location within the `get` method could be the improper usage or absence of the `configure_http_handler` method.

The bug occurred because the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called from the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

To fix the bug, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called after writing the `metrics` data. Also, the `metrics` should have the `configure_http_handler` method before it is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)  # call configure_http_handler before writing
        self.write(metrics)
```

By making sure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called on the `metrics` object before being written, the bug should be fixed. This ensures that the `configure_http_handler` method is called, as expected, and resolves the AssertionError in the test.
