The potential error in the provided function is that the `generate_latest` method of the `_metrics_collector` is being called as an attribute rather than as a function.

The reason behind this bug is that the `generate_latest` method is being accessed as an attribute without actually calling it as a function.

To fix this bug, the `generate_latest` method should be called with parentheses to execute the function and retrieve the metrics.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()  # calling generate_latest as a function
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

By calling `generate_latest()` as a function, the correct metrics will be generated and returned for further processing.
