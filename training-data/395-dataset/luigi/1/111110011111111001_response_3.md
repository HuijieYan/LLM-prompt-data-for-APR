The error is occurring because the `metrics` object is a MagicMock, and when calling `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`, it's not actually calling the real method, but a MagicMock representation of it. This is due to the way MagicMock objects work in Python, as they replace the actual methods or objects they are mocking.

To fix this, the `generate_latest` method should return a MagicMock with the `configure_http_handler` function already set up, rather than returning a separate MagicMock for `configure_http_handler`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

With this fixed code, the `generate_latest` method returns a MagicMock that already has the `configure_http_handler` function set up, so when calling `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`, it actually triggers the correct behavior instead of being a MagicMock representation.
