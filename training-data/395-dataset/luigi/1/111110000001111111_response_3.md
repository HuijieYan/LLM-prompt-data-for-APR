The buggy function `get` is trying to access the `metrics_collector` from `_scheduler._state` using a private attribute(`_metrics_collector`) and then generate the latest metrics. However, the function is not configuring the HTTP handler to write the metrics and is returning the mock object instead.

The reason behind the bug could be that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called on the `metrics` object before writing the metrics to the HTTP response.

To fix the bug in the `get` function, the `configure_http_handler` method needs to be called on the `metrics` object before writing the metrics to the HTTP response. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the fixed function
    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

With this fix, the `configure_http_handler` method is called on the `metrics_collector` object before writing the metrics to the HTTP response.
