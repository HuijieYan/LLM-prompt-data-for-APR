The `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class is expected to fetch metrics using `_scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()` and then configure the HTTP handler and write the metrics using `configure_http_handler` and `self.write` respectively. However, based on the provided input and expected values, it seems that the function is not working as expected.

The error message from the test function indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method was expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times. This is likely due to the incorrect configuration of the method within the `get` function.

The potential error location lies in the usage of `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` within the `get` method. It seems that `metrics` does not have a method called `configure_http_handler`.

To fix this issue, the method `configure_http_handler` should be called directly on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` instead of `metrics`.

Here's the corrected `get` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

With this correction, the method `configure_http_handler` will be called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` as expected, resolving the issue mentioned in the error message from the test function.
