The error message from the test function indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` of `mock._state._metrics_collector` has not been called at all, whereas the test expects it to be called once.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. It seems that `metrics` should actually be `metrics_collector` in order to access the `configure_http_handler` method.

The bug occurred because the `configure_http_handler` method was being called on the wrong object. The `metrics_collector` is the object that has the `configure_http_handler` method, not the `metrics` object.

To fix the bug, the correct object `metrics_collector` should be used to call the `configure_http_handler` method. Additionally, the `self._scheduler` values are different between the buggy and expected cases which might also need to be checked.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

By using the correct `metrics_collector` object to call the `configure_http_handler` method, the bug should be fixed and the test should pass successfully.
