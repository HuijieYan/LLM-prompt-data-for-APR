The error message indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` of `_metrics_collector` has not been called, even though the test expects it to be called once. This suggests that the `if metrics` condition may not be met, causing the `configure_http_handler` method to not be called.

The potential error location is in the `get` method of the function, specifically in the `if metrics` condition.

The bug occurs because the `metrics` object is not being used to call the `configure_http_handler` method, which is why the test fails.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `get` method to properly use the `metrics` object to call the `configure_http_handler` method if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

With this correction, the `configure_http_handler` method will be called if the `metrics` object exists, which is consistent with the expectation in the test case.
