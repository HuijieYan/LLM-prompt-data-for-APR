The potential error in the provided code is that the `generate_latest` method does not return a `Metrics` object. This is causing the `configure_http_handler` method to fail, as it is trying to operate on a non-existent object.

To fix this issue, the `generate_latest` method should return a `Metrics` object that can then be configured using the `configure_http_handler` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(str(metrics))
```

In the corrected code, the `generate_latest` method now returns a `Metrics` object, and the `self.write` method converts the `metrics` object to a string before writing it.

With these changes, the issue of trying to call `configure_http_handler` on a non-existent `Metrics` object is resolved.
