The error message indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it is called 0 times when `self.handler.get()` is invoked in the test case.

Potential error location: The potential error is in the `get` function of the `MetricsHandler` class. It is not calling the `configure_http_handler` method of the metrics collector.

Reason for the bug: The `get` function is not properly configuring the http handler from the metrics collector, causing the test case to fail.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `get` function should call `configure_http_handler` method on the metrics collector before writing the metrics.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` function:

```python
# this is the corrected get function
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(str(metrics))  # Convert metrics to string before writing
```

In this corrected code, `configure_http_handler` method is called on the metrics collector before writing the metrics to the response. Also, `str(metrics)` is used to convert metrics to a string before writing to the response.
