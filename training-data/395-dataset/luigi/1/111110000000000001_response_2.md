The potential error in the provided `get` function is that it is trying to use a method `configure_http_handler` on the `metrics` object, but the `metrics` object seems to be of incorrect type or does not have this method available.

The likely reason for this bug is that the `metrics` object does not have a method `configure_http_handler`, which is expected to be called on it based on the code.

To fix this bug, we need to use the correct method to handle the `metrics` object and write it to the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            self.write(metrics)  # Write the metrics to the response
```
