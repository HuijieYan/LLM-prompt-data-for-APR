The issue is that the function `configure_http_handler` is not being called when it is expected to be called. This could be because the `generate_latest` method may not be returning the expected `metrics` value or the `metrics` object may not be properly configured to call `configure_http_handler`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if metrics` condition. It assumes that if `metrics` is not None, then it should be configured to handle HTTP requests. 

One approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the `generate_latest` method returns a valid `metrics` object, and that the `configure_http_handler` method is properly called on the `metrics` object.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

In this corrected function, the `metrics_collector` is defined separately before calling `generate_latest` and `configure_http_handler` methods on it. This ensures that the `metrics_collector` object is used consistently throughout the function.
