The error message from the test function indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` of `self.mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` was expected to be called once but was actually called 0 times.

The potential error in the `get` function is that it tries to call `configure_http_handler` on the `metrics` object which is incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` should not be called on the `metrics` object. It should be called directly on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`.

To fix the bug, the code for the `get` function should be corrected as follows:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

This code will fix the bug by using `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` to call the `configure_http_handler` method while passing `self` as an argument, instead of calling it on the `metrics` object.
