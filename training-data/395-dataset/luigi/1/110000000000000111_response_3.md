The potential error in the provided code is that the `metrics` object is being used to call the `configure_http_handler` method and then writing the metrics, which is not the correct approach. The `configure_http_handler` method should be called directly on the `_metrics_collector` object.

The reason for the bug is that the `metrics` object does not have a method called `configure_http_handler`, and it seems like the intention is to call this method on the `_metrics_collector` object.

To fix the bug, we need to call `configure_http_handler` on the `_metrics_collector` object and then write the metrics using the corrected function provided below.

```python
# corrected function
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    latest_metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if latest_metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(latest_metrics)
```

In this corrected function, we are first retrieving the `metrics_collector` object and then calling the `generate_latest` method to get the latest metrics. If metrics are available, we then call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics_collector` object and finally write the latest metrics to the response.
