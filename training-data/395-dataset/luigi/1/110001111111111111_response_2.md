The error message indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method of `metrics_collector` is not being called as expected. This is likely due to the `configure_http_handler` not being configured properly within the `get` function.

The bug occurs because the `configure_http_handler` method is being called on the `metrics` object, but it should be called on the `metrics_collector` object.

To fix the bug, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on the `metrics_collector` object and the `metrics` object should be returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

With this correction, the `configure_http_handler` method will be called on the `metrics_collector` object as expected, resolving the error in the test case.
