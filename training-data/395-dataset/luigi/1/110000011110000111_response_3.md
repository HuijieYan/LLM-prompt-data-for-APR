Potential error location: The error message indicates that the method "configure_http_handler" is expected to be called once, but it is not being called at all. This suggests that the buggy function is not invoking "configure_http_handler" as it should.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function "get" is not properly configuring the http handler for the metrics collector. This results in the "configure_http_handler" method not being called, leading to the test failure.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the "configure_http_handler" method is called by the "get" function.
2. Check if the correct instance of the metrics collector is being used to configure the http handler.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)  # fixed method call
        self.write(metrics)
```
