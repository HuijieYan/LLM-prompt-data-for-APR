The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to call a method `configure_http_handler` on the `metrics` object, but `metrics` is not an object that has this method. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to use a callback to further customize the http handler for the metrics collector.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# corrected function
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

In this corrected code, we are calling the `configure_http_handler` method from the `metrics_collector` object, passing `self` (presumably the current object) as an argument. This will allow us to configure the http handler for the metrics collector.
