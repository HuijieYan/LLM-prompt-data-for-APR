The potential error in the problematic function is that the `metrics` object is not being configured with the HTTP handler before being written.

The bug is likely occurring because the `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` line is trying to configure the HTTP handler for the metrics object, but it is not being executed properly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to make sure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called on the `metrics` object before writing it.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
