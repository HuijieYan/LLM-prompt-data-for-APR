The error message indicates that the `sqlalchemy` module is not found, which is required for the `luigi` package. This error occurs when trying to create a local scheduler using the `create_local_scheduler` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `luigi` package is trying to access the task history database even when using the `--local-scheduler` option. This causes issues because the local scheduler does not have access to the same database as the central scheduler.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `create_local_scheduler` method to disable the task history for the local scheduler.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` method:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, record_task_history=False)
```

By setting `record_task_history` to `False`, we ensure that the local scheduler does not attempt to access the task history database.

This fix will prevent the error caused by the missing `sqlalchemy` module when creating a local scheduler.
