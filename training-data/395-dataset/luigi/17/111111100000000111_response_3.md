It appears that the create_local_scheduler function within the _WorkerSchedulerFactory class is attempting to create a local scheduler using the CentralPlannerScheduler class. However, it does not provide an option to disable the task history for the local scheduler, which is causing issues for users who only want to use the local scheduler for testing purposes.

To fix this bug, we can modify the create_local_scheduler function to include an option to disable task history for the local scheduler.

Here's the corrected code for the create_local_scheduler function:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=disable_task_history)
```

By adding the `disable_task_history` parameter to the create_local_scheduler function and passing it to the CentralPlannerScheduler constructor, users can now opt to disable task history for the local scheduler when needed.
