```python
class WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):

    # ... omitted code ...

    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        return CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
The fixed function returns an instance of `CentralPlannerScheduler` without relying on the `scheduler` module.

Given the provided error message, it seems that the `scheduler` module is causing issues, and it's likely trying to import `sqlalchemy` which is not available. Therefore, I removed the unnecessary dependencies and used the existing class names directly.
