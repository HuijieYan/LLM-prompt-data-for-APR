The error message indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the 'sqlalchemy' module. This is likely because the `create_local_scheduler` function is trying to use the `sqlalchemy` module, but it is not imported or installed properly.

To fix this bug, you can update the `create_local_scheduler` function to disable the task history for the local scheduler, as requested in the GitHub issue. 

Here is the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` function:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self, record_task_history=False):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, record_task_history=record_task_history)
```

In this corrected code, a new argument `record_task_history` is added to the function, with a default value of `False`. This allows the user to pass `True` or `False` when creating a local scheduler, to enable or disable task history as needed.

Once this change is applied, the test function `test_local_scheduler_task_history_status` can be modified to pass `record_task_history=True` when creating the local scheduler, in order to verify that task history is enabled.
