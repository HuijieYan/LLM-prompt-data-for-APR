The error message indicates that the 'sqlalchemy' module is not found, which is required for the function `create_local_scheduler` to work properly.

The potential error location is the import statement `from luigi import db_task_history` within the `create_local_scheduler` function. This import statement is causing the error because it tries to import `sqlalchemy`, which is not installed.

The bug occurred because the `create_local_scheduler` function is importing a module that is not installed on the system.

To fix this bug, the `create_local_scheduler` function should be modified to catch the `ModuleNotFoundError` and handle it properly. Additionally, the script should be set up to either install the missing 'sqlalchemy' module, or the function should be modified to use another module that is already installed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    try:
        import sqlalchemy
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
    except ModuleNotFoundError:
        print("Error: 'sqlalchemy' module not found")
        return None  # or handle the error in an appropriate way
```

By adding a `try-except` block, the function will now be able to handle the `ModuleNotFoundError` and ensure that the program doesn't crash if 'sqlalchemy' is not found.
