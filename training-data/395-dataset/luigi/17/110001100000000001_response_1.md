Potential error location:
The potential error in the provided function is the import statement for the `scheduler` module. It seems that `scheduler` is not imported or defined within the `interface.py` file.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the `scheduler` module is not imported or defined within the `interface.py` file. As a result, the function is unable to find the `scheduler` module and is returning a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `scheduler` module within the `interface.py` file.
2. If the `scheduler` module is part of another package, ensure that the correct package and module are imported.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_17/luigi/interface.py
# import statement for the scheduler module is added
from luigi import scheduler

def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
