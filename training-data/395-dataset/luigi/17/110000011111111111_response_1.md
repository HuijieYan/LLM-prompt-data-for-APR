The error message indicates that the `sqlalchemy` module is not found, which is likely causing the `ModuleNotFoundError`. This error occurs when the `luigi` scheduler attempts to import `sqlalchemy` in the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class.

This bug occurs because the `CentralPlannerScheduler` attempts to interact with a database backend to provide task history features. When using the `--local-scheduler`, it tries to access the database even though it's not necessary for local scheduling.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `create_local_scheduler` method to disable task history when using the local scheduler.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=True)
```

By adding the `disable_task_history=True` parameter, we can effectively disable the task history feature when using the local scheduler.
