The potential error in the provided function is that it is attempting to instantiate a CentralPlannerScheduler without passing in any arguments. This could cause issues with the scheduler's behavior.

The bug occurs because the create_local_scheduler function does not provide an option to disable the task history. 

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to accept a parameter that allows users to disable the task history for the local scheduler.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_17/luigi/interface.py

# corrected function
def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=disable_task_history)
```

By adding the `disable_task_history` parameter and passing it to the CentralPlannerScheduler, users can now have the option to disable the task history for the local scheduler when needed. This provides a solution to the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
