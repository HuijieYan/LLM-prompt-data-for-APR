The potential error in the provided function is that it attempts to create a `CentralPlannerScheduler` instance without checking for the option to disable task history for the local scheduler.

The reason behind the bug is that the `create_local_scheduler` function does not provide an option to disable the task history for the local scheduler, causing issues when the local scheduler tries to access the task history db file defined for the central scheduler.

To fix the bug, we can add an option to disable task history for the local scheduler by modifying the `create_local_scheduler` function as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False):
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=disable_task_history)
```

By adding the `disable_task_history` parameter with a default value of False, we provide an option to disable task history for the local scheduler when needed.

This change will allow users to disable task history for the local scheduler by passing the `disable_task_history=True` argument when creating the local scheduler instance.
