Potential error location: The potential error is in the function "create_local_scheduler" where the "CentralPlannerScheduler" is being returned.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The error message suggests that the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class is not defined, which indicates that there may be an issue with importing or defining the class.
2. It's possible that the scheduler module is not imported at the beginning of the code.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Import the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class from the appropriate module.
2. Ensure that the module containing the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class is accessible from the current code location.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
from scheduler import CentralPlannerScheduler

def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
