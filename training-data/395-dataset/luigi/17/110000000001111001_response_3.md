Potential error location: The buggy function is trying to create an instance of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class, but it appears that the `scheduler` module has not been imported.

Reasons behind the bug: The `scheduler` module needs to be imported in order to create an instance of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class. It seems like the necessary import statement is missing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `scheduler` module should be imported at the beginning of the code using the `import` statement.

Corrected code:

```python
# import the necessary module
import scheduler 

# corrected function
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
