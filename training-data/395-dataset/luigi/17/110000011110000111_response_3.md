1. The test case is trying to create a local scheduler using the provided `create_local_scheduler` function. The error message indicates that the `sqlalchemy` module is not found, which is required for task history functionality.

2. The potential error location within the `create_local_scheduler` function is the use of `scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler`, which seems to be incorporating functionality related to task history using `sqlalchemy`.

3. The error occurs because the `create_local_scheduler` function is trying to create a local scheduler that includes functionality related to task history, which requires the `sqlalchemy` module, but this module is not imported or available in the context of a local scheduler.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modify the `create_local_scheduler` function to create a local scheduler that does not include task history functionality.
   - Provide a separate function for creating a local scheduler with task history functionality, if required.

5. Corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` function:
```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.Scheduler()  # Creating a basic local scheduler without task history functionality
```
