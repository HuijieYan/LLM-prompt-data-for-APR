Potential error location: The buggy function is attempting to create an instance of the class "CentralPlannerScheduler" from the module "scheduler", but it seems that the class or module might not be imported properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error may occur due to missing import statements for the "scheduler" module or the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Make sure that the "scheduler" module is properly imported.
2. Ensure that the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class is available within the "scheduler" module.

Corrected code:

```python
# Assuming the scheduler module and CentralPlannerScheduler class are available
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    import scheduler  # import the scheduler module if not already imported
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
