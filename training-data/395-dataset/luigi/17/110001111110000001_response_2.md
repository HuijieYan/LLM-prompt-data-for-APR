The error message indicates that there is a "ModuleNotFoundError" for 'sqlalchemy' when the function `create_local_scheduler` is called. This suggests that the function is trying to import sqlalchemy but it is not available.

The bug is located in the `create_local_scheduler` function, where it tries to initialize `scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler`. This initialization requires sqlalchemy, and while the import statement for sqlalchemy is missing from the code provided, it is clear that the library needs to be imported for the function to work properly.

To fix the bug, the `sqlalchemy` library needs to be imported at the beginning of the `interface.py` file. 

Here's the corrected `create_local_scheduler` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_17/luigi/interface.py
import sqlalchemy  # add this line at the top of the file

def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```

By adding the import statement for sqlalchemy, the bug should be resolved, and the `create_local_scheduler` function should work as intended.
