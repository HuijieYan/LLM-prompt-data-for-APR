1. The test case is trying to create a local scheduler using the `create_local_scheduler` method, and then it is checking the value of `ls._config.record_task_history`. However, when trying to create the local scheduler, the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'` is raised.

2. The potential error location within the `create_local_scheduler` method is the import of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` from the `scheduler` module.

3. The bug occurs because the `CentralPlannerScheduler` is trying to import `sqlalchemy`, which is not available or installed in the environment. This causes the `ModuleNotFoundError` when trying to import `sqlalchemy`.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to handle the import of `sqlalchemy` in a more robust way. This can be achieved by wrapping the import statement in a try-except block and handling the `ModuleNotFoundError` by providing a fallback behavior or raising a more informative error.

5. Corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` method:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    try:
        from luigi.scheduler import CentralPlannerScheduler
        return CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
    except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
        raise ModuleNotFoundError("Failed to import CentralPlannerScheduler. Please make sure all required modules are installed. Original error: {}".format(e))
```
