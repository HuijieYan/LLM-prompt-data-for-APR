Potential error location: The buggy function create_local_scheduler is returning an instance of scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler, which is causing the local scheduler to open the task history db file defined for the central scheduler.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The create_local_scheduler function is not respecting the configuration for the local scheduler and is instead returning an instance of the central scheduler.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to modify the create_local_scheduler function to disable task history for the local scheduler. This can be achieved by creating a new instance of the local scheduler and configuring it to disable task history.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        return scheduler.Scheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, record_task_history=False)
```
In the corrected code, we are creating a new instance of the local scheduler and setting the record_task_history parameter to False, which effectively disables the task history for the local scheduler.
