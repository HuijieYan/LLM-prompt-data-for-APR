The bug in the provided function `create_local_scheduler` is that it is creating a `CentralPlannerScheduler` without an option to disable task history. This bug is causing the local scheduler to try and open the task history db file, which may not necessarily exist in the local environment.

To fix this bug, we need to provide an option to disable the task history for the local scheduler. This will prevent the local scheduler from trying to access the task history db file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=True)
```

By adding the `disable_task_history=True` option, we provide a way to disable the task history for the local scheduler, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
