Potential error location: The create_local_scheduler function is attempting to create a CentralPlannerScheduler without taking into account the need to disable task history for the local scheduler.

Reason for the bug: The create_local_scheduler function does not provide an option to disable task history for the local scheduler. This results in the local scheduler trying to open the task history db file, causing issues when it's not found or not needed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add an optional parameter to the create_local_scheduler function to disable task history for the local scheduler.
2. Modify the CentralPlannerScheduler class to support disabling task history.

```python
# Corrected function
def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=disable_task_history)
```
In the corrected code, I have added an optional parameter `disable_task_history` to the `create_local_scheduler` function with a default value of `False`. This allows the user to disable task history for the local scheduler if needed. The `CentralPlannerScheduler` class is assumed to have been updated to support the `disable_task_history` parameter.
