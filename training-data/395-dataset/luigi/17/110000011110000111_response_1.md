1. The test case `test_local_scheduler_task_history_status` is trying to create a local scheduler using the `create_local_scheduler` method, but it is encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `sqlalchemy`. This is happening because the method is trying to import `sqlalchemy` without including it as a dependency.

2. The potential error location is the `create_local_scheduler` method, specifically the line `import sqlalchemy`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `create_local_scheduler` method is trying to import `sqlalchemy` without including it as a dependency. This causes a `ModuleNotFoundError` when the method is called.

4. To fix the bug, the method should use `sqlalchemy` as a dependency and import it properly to avoid the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Additionally, the method should provide an option to disable task history for the local scheduler.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import luigi
from luigi.scheduler import CentralPlannerScheduler
from luigi import six

class WorkerSchedulerFactory:
    def create_local_scheduler(self, record_task_history=True):
        if record_task_history:
            return CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
        else:
            return CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, record_task_history=False)
```

In this corrected code, the `create_local_scheduler` method takes an optional argument `record_task_history` which defaults to `True`. If `record_task_history` is `True`, the method returns a `CentralPlannerScheduler` with task history enabled. If `record_task_history` is `False`, the method returns a `CentralPlannerScheduler` with task history disabled. This allows for the option to disable task history for the local scheduler.
