The error message indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the module `sqlalchemy` in the `luigi/db_task_history.py` file. This informs us that the bug is within the `create_local_scheduler` method of the `_WorkerSchedulerFactory` class, where the `CentralPlannerScheduler` is being instantiated with `prune_on_get_work=True`, which in turn is trying to import `sqlalchemy`.

The reason for this bug is that the `CentralPlannerScheduler` requires `sqlalchemy` which is not available in the current scope.

To fix this bug, we need to import `sqlalchemy` within the `create_local_scheduler` method, or update the imports at the beginning of the file. We also need to ensure that the `sqlalchemy` library is installed in the environment.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        import sqlalchemy  # import sqlalchemy here
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
