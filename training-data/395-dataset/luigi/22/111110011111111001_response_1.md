The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to add `self.last_active` (which is of type `NoneType`) to `config.worker_disconnect_delay` (which is of type `int`).

The reason behind this error is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is set to `None` by default, and it is never updated in the code. Therefore, when the `prune` method tries to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, it encounters a `NoneType` which cannot be added to an `int`.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize `self.last_active` with the current time when it is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if `last_active` is not provided during the initialization of the `Worker` object, `self.last_active` will be set to the current time using `time.time()`.
