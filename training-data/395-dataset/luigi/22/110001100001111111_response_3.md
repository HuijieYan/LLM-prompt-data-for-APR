The potential error in the provided function is that it is missing the `import time` statement, which is necessary for using the `time` module in Python. This leads to a `NameError` when trying to access the `time.time()` function.

To fix this bug, the `time` module should be imported at the beginning of the file by adding the line `import time`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import time  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the function should work as intended and return the expected values and types specified in the test case.
