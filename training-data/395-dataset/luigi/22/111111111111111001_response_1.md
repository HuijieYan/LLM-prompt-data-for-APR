The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method, and the code does not check for this before performing the addition operation in the `prune` method.

To fix this issue, we can check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition operation. If it is `None`, we can set it to the current time.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, we check if `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time if it is. This ensures that the `last_active` parameter always has a valid value.

This should resolve the TypeError when calling the `prune` method.
