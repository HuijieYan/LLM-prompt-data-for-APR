Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `last_active` parameter not being set correctly when the function is called.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `last_active` parameter is not being set correctly in the `__init__` function, which is leading to incorrect values for `self.last_active` and `self.started`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the `__init__` function to properly initialize the `last_active` parameter and set `self.started` to the current time.

Corrected code:

```python
import time

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the `last_active` parameter if it's provided, or setting it to the current time if it's None, the corrected code will properly initialize the `last_active` value, and the variables `self.id`, `self.started`, `self.tasks`, and `self.info` will have the expected values.
