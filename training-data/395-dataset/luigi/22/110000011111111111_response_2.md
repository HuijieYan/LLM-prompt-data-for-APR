The error occurs because the `last_active` attribute is initialized with a default value of `None`, and when it is used in the `prune` method, an unsupported operation occurs when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, which is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `last_active` is set to the current time if no value is provided during initialization.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning operation here
            pass
```

By initializing `last_active` with the current time if no value is provided, we ensure that it holds a valid timestamp and avoid the TypeError when using it in the `prune` method.
