The error message indicates a TypeError occurring on line 245 of the file luigi/scheduler.py. This points to an issue with the addition operation in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `last_active` attribute. It is initialized as None, and later in the `prune` method, it tries to perform addition with an integer value. This results in a TypeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is not being set to a valid time value at the time of initialization.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` attribute should be initialized with a default value that represents the time of initialization if `last_active` is not provided during object creation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the prune operation here
            pass
```

In this corrected code, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current time using `time.time()` if it's not provided during object creation. This ensures that `last_active` always has a valid time value for future calculations.
