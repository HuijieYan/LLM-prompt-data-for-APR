The error message indicates that the issue is with the addition operation in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. Specifically, it states "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'", which suggests that `self.last_active` is of type `None` at the time of the addition operation.

Looking at the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, we can see that the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`. This default value is then assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method. This is causing the TypeError in the `prune` method when trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.last_active` is correctly initialized in the `__init__` method. One approach could be to provide a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method itself, rather than as a default parameter.

Here's a corrected version of the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            pass  # prune logic here
```

In this corrected version, we provide a default value of `0` for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, which ensures that it is always initialized to a valid value.
