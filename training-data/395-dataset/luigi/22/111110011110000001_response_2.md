1. The test function attempts to create a Worker object and then call the `prune` method on it, passing a configuration object as an argument.

2. The potential error location within the `Worker` class is the `prune` method, specifically the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.

3. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` when trying to perform the operation `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay`, because `self.last_active` is of type `None` and `config.worker_disconnect_delay` is an integer. This suggests that `self.last_active` was not properly initialized in the `__init__` method.

4. To fix the bug, we can initialize `self.last_active` with a default value of 0 if it is not provided as an argument.

5. Here's the corrected `__init__` method for the `Worker` class:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected __init__ method
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected __init__ method
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this change, the `last_active` attribute will default to 0 if not provided, preventing the `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called.
