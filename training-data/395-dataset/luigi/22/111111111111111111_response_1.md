The error is occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. It is trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, but `self.last_active` is initialized as `None`, which causes the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self.last_active` to the current time when it is not provided as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method in the `Worker` class:

```python
from time import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it always has a valid value.
