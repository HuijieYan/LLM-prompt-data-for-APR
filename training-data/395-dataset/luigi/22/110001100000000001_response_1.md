Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the initialization of the "__init__" method of the class. The error message mentions the "self" variable, so the issue is likely related to the use of "self" within the method.

Reasons for the Bug:
The issue is caused by using the "self" variable within the "__init__" method before it has been initialized properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the "__init__" method should be modified to properly initialize the attributes of the class using the "self" variable.

Corrected Code:
```python
import time

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
