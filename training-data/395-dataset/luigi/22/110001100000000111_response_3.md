The potential error in the given code is that the `time` module has not been imported, so the `time.time()` function will cause an error.

The reason for the bug is that the `time` module is being used without being imported, so the `time.time()` function call will result in an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code with the `time` module imported:

```python
import time

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py

# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
