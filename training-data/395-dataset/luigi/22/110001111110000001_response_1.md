Potential error location: 
The potential error location is within the `prune` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module. The error occurs in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():` where it tries to add `self.last_active`, which is of type `None`, with an integer value.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is set to `None` by default, and it is not handled properly in the `prune` method when trying to add it to an integer value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `__init__` method to handle the `last_active` parameter more effectively, ensuring it is initialized to a valid timestamp.
2. Modify the `prune` method to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and provide a default value or handle it differently.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

# No changes needed in the test function
```
