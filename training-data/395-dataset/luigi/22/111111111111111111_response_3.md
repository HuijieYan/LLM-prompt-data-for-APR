1. The test case creates a Worker object and then calls the `prune` method on it, passing in a `TmpCfg` object as an argument.
2. The potential error location seems to be in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, specifically on the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.
3. The error message indicates that the addition operation is being performed between a `NoneType` (self.last_active) and an `int` (config.worker_disconnect_delay), which is not supported.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and choose an appropriate default value to use in the addition operation. One approach is to use the current time as the default value for `last_active` if it is `None`.
5. Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch or default to current time
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method will default to `None` if not provided, and if it is `None`, it will be set to the current time using `time.time()`. This will ensure that `last_active` always has a valid value and can be used in the `prune` method without causing a `NoneType` error.
