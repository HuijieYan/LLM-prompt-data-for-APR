Potential Error Location:
The buggy function is the constructor (__init__) of the Worker class.

Explanation:
The bug is likely due to the initialization of the 'last_active' and 'started' attributes of the Worker class. The 'last_active' attribute is initialized with a default value if no value is provided, but the 'started' attribute is directly initialized with the current time using the time.time() function. This inconsistency may lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should initialize both 'last_active' and 'started' attributes consistently. One approach is to set the 'last_active' attribute to the current time if no value is provided, similar to what is done for the 'started' attribute.

Corrected Code:
```python
import time  # add this import statement if it's not already included

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In the corrected code, the 'last_active' attribute is initialized with the provided value if it's not None, otherwise, it's initialized with the current time. This ensures consistency with the initialization of the 'started' attribute.
