Potential error location: the `import time` statement is missing at the top of the Python file, which causes an error when trying to use `time.time()` without importing the `time` module.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `time` module is not imported, so when the `time.time()` method is called, it results in an error.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Import the `time` module at the beginning of the file to resolve the issue.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py
import time  # import the time module

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
