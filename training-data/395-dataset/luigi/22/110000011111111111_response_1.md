The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the addition operation is being performed on a `NoneType` and an `int`.

The potential error location is the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class, which is being initialized with a default value of `None`. This causes the `TypeError` when trying to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` to `last_active` in the `prune` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is not properly initialized, and it remains as `None` causing the `TypeError` when trying to perform operations on it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized when the `Worker` class is instantiated.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if the `last_active` argument is not provided, it will default to the current time using `time.time()`. This should prevent the `NoneType` error when trying to perform operations on `last_active` in the `prune` method.
