The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module, more specifically at line 245.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self.last_active = last_active`, where the `last_active` parameter is assigned to the `last_active` attribute of the worker instance.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is being set as `None` by default if not provided as an argument, and then an attempt is made to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it in the `prune` method, resulting in a TypeError due to the operation between `NoneType` and `int`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if `last_active` is `None` or not before trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to it. If it is `None`, then the current timestamp should be used as the value for `last_active`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # implement prune logic here
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized with the current timestamp if it is not provided as an argument, avoiding the TypeError that was previously occurring.
