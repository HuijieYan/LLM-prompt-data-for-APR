Potential error location: The last_active parameter is being assigned a default value of None, but it should be assigned the value passed as an argument.

Reason for the bug: The last_active parameter is not being correctly initialized with the value passed as an argument, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Remove the default value for the last_active parameter and assign the value passed as an argument directly.
- Import the time module if it's not already imported and use time.time() to initialize the last_active parameter if no value is passed.

Corrected code:
```python
import time

def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
