Potential error location: The error is likely in the initialization of the `started` attribute using `time.time()` without importing the `time` module.

Reason for the bug: The `time` module needs to be imported before calling the `time.time()` function, otherwise it will result in an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `time` module at the beginning of the script or within the class before initializing the `started` attribute.
2. Ensure that the `time` module is available in the environment where the code will be executed.

Corrected code:

```python
# import the time module at the beginning
import time

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
