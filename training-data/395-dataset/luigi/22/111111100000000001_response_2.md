The bug in the given code is that the `time` module is being used without importing it. This will result in a `NameError` because the `time` module is not defined.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code with the `time` module imported:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py
import time

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
