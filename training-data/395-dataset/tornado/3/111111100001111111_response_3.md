The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition that checks for inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache. The error is occurring when the method close() is called on the AsyncHTTPClient object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that there is a check for inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache in the close() method which is causing a RuntimeError if the condition is met.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the close() method to handle the cache inconsistency in a more robust way, ensuring that it does not raise a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the close() method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache and self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] is self:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

This corrected code ensures that the close() method handles the cache inconsistency in a more appropriate manner without raising a RuntimeError.
