The potential error in the `close` function is that it is referencing variables that are not defined within the function (`self._closed`, `self._instance_cache`, `self.io_loop`). This would cause the function to raise a NameError when it is called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to access instance variables that are not defined within the function scope.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the variables `self._closed`, `self._instance_cache`, and `self.io_loop` are defined within the class and can be accessed by the `close` function.

Corrected code:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if hasattr(self, '_closed') and not self._closed:
        self._closed = True
        if hasattr(self, '_instance_cache') and self._instance_cache is not None:
            if hasattr(self, 'io_loop') and self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
