The test case `test_destructor_log` is trying to test the behavior of the `AsyncHTTPClient` destructor when the process is shutting down. The error message indicates that the subprocess produced unexpected output, which triggers an assertion error.

The potential error location within the `AsyncHTTPClient` destructor is the condition where if `self._instance_cache` is not `None`, it checks if the instance cache for `self.io_loop` is not equal to `self`, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache".

The bug occurs because the condition checks for inequality (`is not`) instead of equality (`==`). This would lead to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `close` method of `AsyncHTTPClient` needs to be modified to check for equality (`==`) instead of inequality (`is not`).

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
        """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

        This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
        that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
        ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
        `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
        argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

        No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
        ``close()``.

        """
        if self._closed:
            return
        self._closed = True
        if self._instance_cache is not None:
            if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) != self:
                raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
