The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" indicates that there is an issue with the cache handling in the `AsyncHTTPClient` class. The error occurs when the `close` method is called on an instance of the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

From the error message and the test case, it seems that the issue is related to the caching of the `AsyncHTTPClient` instances.

To fix the bug, the caching logic in the `close` method needs to be carefully reviewed and handled appropriately to ensure consistency.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method in the `AsyncHTTPClient` class:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache:
        for ioloop, client in self._instance_cache.items():
            if client is self:
                del self._instance_cache[ioloop]
                break
```

In the corrected code, the cache handling in the `close` method has been updated to address the potential inconsistency issues. This updated logic ensures that the client instance is properly removed from the cache.

This should resolve the "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" issue.
