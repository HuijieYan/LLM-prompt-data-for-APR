The error message suggests that there is an inconsistency in the `AsyncHTTPClient` cache, which is likely causing the `RuntimeError` when the `close` method is called.

The bug is likely occurring due to the `close` method not properly handling the instance cache and the `io_loop`. The code is attempting to access the instance cache and compare it with the current `io_loop`, leading to the inconsistency and the `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, the `close` method needs to be modified to properly handle the instance cache and the `io_loop`:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        instance = self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop)
        if instance is not None and instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        if instance is not None:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
