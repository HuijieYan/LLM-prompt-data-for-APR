The error message states that the subprocess produced unexpected output, and refers to an "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" error from a destructor when the process is shutting down. This indicates that there is an issue with the destructor for the AsyncHTTPClient class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class. The bug is likely caused by a race condition where the client is being closed while still being referenced.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `close` method properly handles the cleanup of resources and ensures that it cannot be called on a closed client.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class:

```python
# this is the corrected close method
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if hasattr(self, '_closed') and not self._closed:
        self._closed = True
        if hasattr(self, '_instance_cache') and self._instance_cache is not None:
            if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache and self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] is self:
                del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the `close` method cannot be called on an already closed client. We also added checks to ensure that the `_closed` and `_instance_cache` attributes exist before using them. These changes should prevent the race condition and the "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" error.
