Potential error location:
The potential error in the `close` method is at the line `if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:` as it is checking for identity (`is`) instead of equality (`==`).

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `is` keyword is used for checking equality, which checks if two variables refer to the same object, not if they have the same value. In this case, it seems the intention was to check for equality in terms of values, not identity.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Replace the `is` keyword with the `==` operator to check for equality in terms of values.

Corrected code:
```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) != self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
