Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be related to the `self._instance_cache` attribute, which is being checked and manipulated without being initialized or defined anywhere in the provided code.

Approaches for fixing the bug: We need to initialize the `_closed` and `_instance_cache` attributes in the constructor of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class to prevent the AttributeError in the close method. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `self.io_loop` is None.

Corrected code:

```python
class AsyncHTTPClient(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, force_instance=False) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self._closed = False
        self._instance_cache = {}

    def close(self) -> None:
        """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.
    
        This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
        that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
        ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
        `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
        argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.
    
        No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
        ``close()``.
    
        """
        if self._closed:
            return
        self._closed = True
        if self.io_loop and self.io_loop in self._instance_cache:
            if self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
In this corrected code, we added the initialization of `_closed` and `_instance_cache` in the constructor, and we handled the case where `self.io_loop` is None in the close method to prevent the AttributeError and potential RuntimeError.
