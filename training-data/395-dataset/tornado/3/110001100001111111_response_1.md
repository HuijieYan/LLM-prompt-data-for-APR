The error is occurring when the `close()` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class is called. The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" indicates that there is an inconsistency in the cache of the `AsyncHTTPClient` object.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue is with the handling of the `_instance_cache`. The `close()` method tries to remove the `AsyncHTTPClient` instance from the cache, but it may not be functioning correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to properly remove the `AsyncHTTPClient` instance from the cache when the `close()` method is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `close()` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        instance = self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop)
        if instance is not None and instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        if instance is self:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
``` 

In the corrected code, we first check if the instance exists in the cache for the current IOLoop. If it does, then we proceed to remove it from the cache. If it doesn't exist, we consider it as an inconsistency in the cache and raise a `RuntimeError` as before.
