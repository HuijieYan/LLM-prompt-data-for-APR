Potential error location:
The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" indicates that there is an issue with the consistency of the `AsyncHTTPClient` cache.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `close()` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` is not properly handling the cache when the client is closed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the cache handling logic in the `close()` method to ensure that it correctly removes the `AsyncHTTPClient` from the cache.
2. Verify that the cache consistency is maintained when the client is closed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        instance = self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop)
        if instance is not None and instance is self:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
