The bug occurs in the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class. The function attempts to check and remove itself from a cache and raise an error if it cannot be removed, resulting in a "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" error. Additionally, the error log from the test case indicates that the error is caused by a destructor trying to use the `close` method while shutting down.

To fix the bug, the `AsyncHTTPClient` class should:

1. Check if `self._instance_cache` exists before trying to access it.
2. Only execute the cache-related code if `self._instance_cache` is available to avoid the inconsistent cache error.
3. Handle the `close` method being called during shutdown gracefully to avoid the inconsistent cache error.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if hasattr(self, '_instance_cache') and self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            return
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

This corrected code adds a check to see if `self._instance_cache` exists before attempting to use it, and only executes the cache-related code if it exists. This should prevent the "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" error.
