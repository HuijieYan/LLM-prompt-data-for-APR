The potential error in the provided function is related to the conditional check for `self._closed`. It seems that the function is intended to close the HTTP client and free any file descriptors used, but the conditional check is not properly implemented.

The bug occurs because the method is checking the value of `self._closed` to determine if the client has already been closed. However, there is no indication in the code that `self._closed` is ever set to True, so the function may not work as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to set `self._closed` to True when the `close()` method is called. Then, we can remove the conditional check for `self._closed` and simply perform the necessary cleanup operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `close()` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
