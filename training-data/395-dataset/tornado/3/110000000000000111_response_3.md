Potential error location: The error occurs in the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class in the Tornado library.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs due to inconsistency in the `AsyncHTTPClient` cache when the `close` method is called. It seems that the cache is not properly managed, leading to the RuntimeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `close` method needs to properly handle the instance cache to ensure consistency and avoid the RuntimeError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        instance = self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop)
        if instance and instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        if instance:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
