The bug is occurring in the close() method of the AsyncHTTPClient class. The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" is caused by the if condition checking for self._instance_cache. This if condition is raising the RuntimeError when the condition is not met.

The reason behind the bug is that the close() method is not handling the case where self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not equal to self.

To fix this bug, we can modify the close() method to handle this case properly. We can add an else block to the if condition to raise the RuntimeError when the condition is not met. This will ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when the cache is inconsistent.

Here's the corrected code for the close() method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        else:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]

```
