Potential Error: 
The potential error in the "close" function is that there is a conditional check for the "_closed" attribute, which is not defined anywhere in the code provided. This will result in a "NameError" when trying to access an undefined attribute.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the "_closed" attribute was referenced in the "close" function without being defined elsewhere in the code.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
The "_closed" attribute needs to be defined within the class and initialized to False by default.

Corrected Code:
```python
class AsyncHTTPClient(Configurable):
    def __init__(self):
        self._closed = False

    def close(self) -> None:
        """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

        This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
        that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
        ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
        `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
        argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

        No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
        ``close()``.

        """
        if self._closed:
            return
        self._closed = True
        if self._instance_cache is not None:
            if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
