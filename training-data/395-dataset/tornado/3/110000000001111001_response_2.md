Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the condition `if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self` which could be causing the RuntimeError.

Reason for the bug: The bug may be occurring due to the comparison `is not self` which checks for identity (i.e., if the two objects are the same object in memory), rather than equality.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of using the `is not` comparison, we should use the `!=` operator to check for inequality based on the object's attributes.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) != self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
