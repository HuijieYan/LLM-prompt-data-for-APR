The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" indicates that there is a problem with the cache management in the `close` method of the AsyncHTTPClient class. The error message is being triggered when the program attempts to close the HTTP client.

The main issue in the provided `close` method is that it is not properly handling the instance cache. When trying to close the `AsyncHTTPClient`, it should remove its reference from the instance cache if it exists. However, the current implementation does not handle this properly, leading to the inconsistent cache error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `close` method properly removes the reference from the instance cache if it exists. Additionally, we need to restructure the method to better handle the closing process.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        instance = self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop)
        if instance is not None and instance is not self:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

This correction ensures that the `close` method properly removes the reference from the instance cache if it exists. By doing so, we prevent the "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" error when closing the HTTP client.

After making this correction, the test function `test_destructor_log` should no longer produce the "subprocess produced unexpected output" error.
