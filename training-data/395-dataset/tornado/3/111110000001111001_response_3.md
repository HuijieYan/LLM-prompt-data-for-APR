Potential error location: The _closed attribute is being used before it is defined or initialized.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The _closed attribute is not defined or initialized anywhere in the code provided.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Initialize the _closed attribute before using it in the close() method.

Corrected code:

```python
class AsyncHTTPClient(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self):
        self._closed = False  # initialize the _closed attribute

    def close(self) -> None:
        """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.
    
        This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
        that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
        ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
        `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
        argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.
    
        No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
        ``close()``.
    
        """
        if self._closed:
            return
        self._closed = True
        if self._instance_cache is not None:
            if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
