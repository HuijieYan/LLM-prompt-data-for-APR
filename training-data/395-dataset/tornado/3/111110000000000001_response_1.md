Potential error location: 
The error occurs when the close() method is called on the AsyncHTTPClient class instance.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the close() method is not effectively handling the _instance_cache attribute.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The close() method should be modified to handle the _instance_cache attribute properly. This can be achieved by checking if the _instance_cache exists and then deleting the instance from the cache.

Corrected code:
```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop is None:

            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
