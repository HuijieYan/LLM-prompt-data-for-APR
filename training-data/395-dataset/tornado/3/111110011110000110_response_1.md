# class declaration containing the fixed function
class AsyncHTTPClient(Configurable):
    """
    An non-blocking HTTP client.
    
    Example usage::
    
        async def f():
            http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
            try:
                response = await http_client.fetch("http://www.google.com")
            except Exception as e:
                print("Error: %s" % e)
            else:
                print(response.body)
    
    The constructor for this class is magic in several respects: It
    actually creates an instance of an implementation-specific
    subclass, and instances are reused as a kind of pseudo-singleton
    (one per `.IOLoop`). The keyword argument ``force_instance=True``
    can be used to suppress this singleton behavior. Unless
    ``force_instance=True`` is used, no arguments should be passed to
    the `AsyncHTTPClient` constructor. The implementation subclass as
    well as arguments to its constructor can be set with the static
    method `configure()`
    
    All `AsyncHTTPClient` implementations support a ``defaults``
    keyword argument, which can be used to set default values for
    `HTTPRequest` attributes.  For example::
    
        AsyncHTTPClient.configure(
            None, defaults=dict(user_agent="MyUserAgent"))
        # or with force_instance:
        client = AsyncHTTPClient(force_instance=True,
            defaults=dict(user_agent="MyUserAgent"))
    
    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.

        This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
