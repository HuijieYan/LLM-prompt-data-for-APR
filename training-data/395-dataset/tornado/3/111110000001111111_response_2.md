The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" indicates that there is an issue with the caching mechanism of the AsyncHTTPClient. The error occurs when the close() method is called on the AsyncHTTPClient object.

The potential error location within the close() method is the conditional check and deletion of the instance in the _instance_cache dictionary.

The bug occurs because the close() method checks if the current instance is in the _instance_cache dictionary based on the io_loop, and if it's not found, it raises a RuntimeError. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in how the instance is stored and retrieved from the cache, leading to the inconsistent behavior and the RuntimeError.

To fix this bug, the close() method should be modified to ensure that the instance is properly removed from the _instance_cache dictionary.

Here is the corrected code for the close() method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache and self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] is self:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the _instance_cache is not None. Then, we verify if the current instance is in the _instance_cache dictionary based on the io_loop. If it is found, we proceed to delete it from the cache. This ensures the proper removal of the instance from the cache and prevents the inconsistency that leads to the RuntimeError.
