The issue arises from the `close` method of the `HTTPClient` class in the `tornado.httpclient` module. The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" indicates that there is an inconsistency in the `AsyncHTTPClient` cache when the `close` method is called.

The potential error location is within the conditional statement that checks for the consistency of the `AsyncHTTPClient` cache:

```python
if self._instance_cache is not None:
    if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
        raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
    del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

The reason for this bug is that the cache check is not implemented correctly, causing the inconsistency error to be raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the cache check needs to be revised to ensure that it correctly verifies the consistency of the `AsyncHTTPClient` cache.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method:

```python
# Corrected close method
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) != self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement inside the `close` method has been updated to `if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) != self` to properly check the consistency of the `AsyncHTTPClient` cache. This modification ensures that the cache is correctly checked for consistency and the RuntimeError is raised only when necessary.
