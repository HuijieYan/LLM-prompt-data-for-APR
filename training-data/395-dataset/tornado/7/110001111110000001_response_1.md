The error message suggests a TypeError that is occurring when trying to use a Future object in an 'await' expression.

Upon careful analysis of the provided test function and the buggy function, it appears that the issue is within the `run_in_executor` method. The implementation of the `run_in_executor` method is not correctly returning a coroutine-friendly awaitable result. 

The bug occurs because the `run_in_executor` method is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object directly, which cannot be used in an 'await' expression. To fix this issue, the `run_in_executor` method needs to wrap the result in a Tornado `functools.partial` or `functools.partialmethod` object, which can be awaited.

Below is the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import concurrent.futures
import functools

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return self._run_in_executor(executor, func, *args)

def _run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    return concurrent.futures.wrap_future(executor.submit(func, *args))
```

By using the `_run_in_executor` method to wrap the result in a Tornado `concurrent.futures` object, the result becomes an awaitable object that can be used in 'await' expressions.
