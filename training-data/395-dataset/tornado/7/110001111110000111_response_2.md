The error message indicates a TypeError related to 'await' expression. This suggests that there is an issue with how the function `run_in_executor` is being used within the test case. The error occurs when trying to await the result of `run_in_executor`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return executor.submit(func, *args)` line. It seems that the function is returning a concurrent Future directly, which is causing the TypeError when trying to await it.

The bug occurs because the `run_in_executor` function is returning a concurrent Future directly, but the test case is trying to await its result. This causes a TypeError because the direct use of a Future object in an await expression is not allowed.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function could wrap the `executor.submit(func, *args)` call in a `lambda` function, and then return the result of the lambda function. This encapsulation allows for the use of await on the result, as the lambda function would invoke the concurrent Future and await its result.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return lambda: executor.submit(func, *args).result()
```

By wrapping the `executor.submit(func, *args)` call in a lambda function and then immediately invoking it to get the result, the corrected code allows the use of await on the result.
