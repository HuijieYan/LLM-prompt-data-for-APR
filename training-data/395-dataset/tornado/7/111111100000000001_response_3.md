Potential error location: 
The `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` condition is checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None, which is incorrect. It should be checking if `executor` is None.

Reason behind the bug:
The `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` condition is incorrectly checking the availability of the ThreadPoolExecutor, and the subsequent check for `executor` being None is not sufficient to handle all scenarios.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition to check if `executor` is None instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
2. Add error handling for cases where `executor` is not available or not provided.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            max_workers = cpu_count() * 5
            try:
                from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers)
            except ImportError:
                raise RuntimeError("concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
