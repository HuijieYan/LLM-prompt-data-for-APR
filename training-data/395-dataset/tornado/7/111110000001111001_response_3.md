The error "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor" occurs due to the wrong conditional statement in the run_in_executor function in the provided code.

The bug is located in the run_in_executor function where it checks for the availability of ThreadPoolExecutor. The `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` condition checks whether the ThreadPoolExecutor class itself is None rather than if it's imported successfully or not, resulting in the RuntimeError message.

To fix this bug, the correct conditional statement should check whether the ThreadPoolExecutor class is available or not, instead of checking if it is None.

Below is the corrected code for the run_in_executor function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  # import ThreadPoolExecutor here

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """
        Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

        """
        if not ThreadPoolExecutor:  # check if ThreadPoolExecutor is available
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor

        return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
