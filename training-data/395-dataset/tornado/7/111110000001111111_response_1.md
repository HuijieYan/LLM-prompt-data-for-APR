The problem seems to be that the function run_in_executor is intended to use concurrent.futures.Executor, but it is not doing so correctly. The current implementation is directly referencing ThreadPoolExecutor, which may lead to type mismatch or other issues.

The bug arises because the function first checks if ThreadPoolExecutor is None, which is incorrect. The correct way to check if the module is available is to use `concurrent.futures` instead of directly checking ThreadPoolExecutor.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.
    
        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    
        """
        if concurrent.futures is None:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")
    
        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor
    
        return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

This implementation checks for the availability of the concurrent.futures module and then uses ThreadPoolExecutor from it.

The new implementation should fix the bug and provide the expected functionality for the `run_in_executor` method.
