The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line "if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:". This line is attempting to check if ThreadPoolExecutor exists, but the way it's written will always evaluate to False because it's comparing the class itself to None, rather than checking if the class is available.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition is checking the class itself, which will never be equal to None, so the RuntimeError will always be raised.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check if ThreadPoolExecutor is available and then handle the case if it is not.

```python
# this is the corrected function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """
    Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  # Import the ThreadPoolExecutor

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
