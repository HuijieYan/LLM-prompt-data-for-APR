Potential Error Location:
The error in the function `run_in_executor` is due to the incorrect check `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`. This condition is never going to be true because `ThreadPoolExecutor` is a class and not `None`.

Reasons for the Occurrence of the Bug:
The condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` will always evaluate to `False` because `ThreadPoolExecutor` is a class and not `None`. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised even if the executor is not `None`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` needs to be replaced with `if executor is None` to check if the executor is `None` instead of checking the class itself.

Corrected Code:
```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
