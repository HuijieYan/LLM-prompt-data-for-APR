Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`. It should be `if executor is None`.

Reasons for the Bug:
The condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` does not check if the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class is available. Instead, it checks if the `executor` variable is None. This can lead to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the condition to `if executor is None` to check if the `executor` variable is None.
2. Import `ThreadPoolExecutor` if it's not already imported.

Corrected Code:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
