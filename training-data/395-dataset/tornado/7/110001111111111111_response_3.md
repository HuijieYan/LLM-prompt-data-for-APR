The error message indicates a TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression. This error suggests that the Future object returned from the `run_in_executor` function is not compatible with the await expression in the async_wrapper function. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is on the line `return executor.submit(func, *args)`, where the `submit` method of the executor returns a concurrent.futures.Future object, which is not compatible with the await expression.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run_in_executor` function is not returning a compatible type of future that can be used with `await` expression. 

To fix the bug, the `run_in_executor` function needs to return a Tornado Future instead of a concurrent.futures.Future. This can be achieved by using Tornado's concurrent.Future class and running the `func` with the given arguments inside a `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = tornado.concurrent.Future()

    def _on_complete(future, func, args):
        try:
            result = func(*args)
            future.set_result(result)
        except Exception as e:
            future.set_exception(e)

    executor.submit(_on_complete, future, func, args)

    return future
```
