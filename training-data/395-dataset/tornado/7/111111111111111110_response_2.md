    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:
    
    .. testcode::
    
        import errno
        import functools
        import tornado.ioloop
        import socket
    
        def connection_ready(sock, fd, events):
            while True:
                try:
                    connection, address = sock.accept()
                except socket.error as e:
                    if e.args[0] not in (errno.EWOULDBLOCK, errno.EAGAIN):
                        raise
                    return
                connection.setblocking(0)
                handle_connection(connection, address)
    
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
            sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
            sock.setblocking(0)
            sock.bind(("", port))
            sock.listen(128)
    
            io_loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
            callback = functools.partial(connection_ready, sock)
            io_loop.add_handler(sock.fileno(), callback, io_loop.READ)
            io_loop.start()
    
    .. testoutput::
       :hide:
    
    By default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current
    `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior
    can be controlled with the ``make_current`` argument to the `IOLoop`
    constructor: if ``make_current=True``, the new `IOLoop` will always
    try to become current and it raises an error if there is already a
    current instance. If ``make_current=False``, the new `IOLoop` will
    not try to become current.
    
    In general, an `IOLoop` cannot survive a fork or be shared across
    processes in any way. When multiple processes are being used, each
    process should create its own `IOLoop`, which also implies that
    any objects which depend on the `IOLoop` (such as
    `.AsyncHTTPClient`) must also be created in the child processes.
    As a guideline, anything that starts processes (including the
    `tornado.process` and `multiprocessing` modules) should do so as
    early as possible, ideally the first thing the application does
    after loading its configuration in ``main()``.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.

            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor
    
        return TornadoFuture(executor.submit(func, *args))
    
```
Explanation:
The issue with the original function `run_in_executor` was that it didn't return a `TornadoFuture`. The corrected function now returns a `TornadoFuture` by wrapping the `executor.submit` call in it. This will address the type error encountered in the given test function.
