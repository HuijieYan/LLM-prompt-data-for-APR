The error message is indicating a `TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression`. This suggests that the `run_in_executor` method is not returning a suitable `Future` object that can be awaited.

The potential error location within the `run_in_executor` function is the `return executor.submit(func, *args)` line, which is using the `ThreadPoolExecutor.submit` method. This method returns a `Future` object that represents the execution of the given func with the given args.

The bug is occurring because the `run_in_executor` method is not returning a `Future` object that can be awaited.

To fix this bug, the return statement in the `run_in_executor` method should use `tornado.concurrent.future` instead of `executor.submit`. This will ensure that a suitable `Future` object is returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = concurrent.future.Future()
    executor.submit(future.set_result, func(*args))
    return future
```
