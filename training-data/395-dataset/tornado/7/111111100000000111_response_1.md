Potential Error location: The potential error is in the line "if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:". This should be "if executor is None".

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The current code is incorrectly checking if the ThreadPoolExecutor is None instead of the passed executor. This causes a RuntimeError to be raised even if an executor is passed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Change the condition to check if the passed executor is None instead of checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is None.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
