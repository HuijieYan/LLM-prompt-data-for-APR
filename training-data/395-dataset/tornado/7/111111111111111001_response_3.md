The issue with the `run_in_executor` function is that it is not handling the case where the `executor` is `None` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` is also `None`. This causes the `RuntimeError` to not be raised when it should be, leading to the error in the test case.

To fix this issue, one approach is to explicitly check if `executor` is `None` and if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is also `None`. If both are `None`, then a `RuntimeError` should be raised. Additionally, the code should handle the case where `ThreadPoolExecutor` is available and create a new executor if `self._executor` is not set.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    if executor is None:
        # Use default executor
        if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor
    elif ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

This corrected code includes explicit checks for the availability of `ThreadPoolExecutor` and handles the case where both `executor` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` are `None` by raising a `RuntimeError`. It also creates a new executor if `self._executor` is not set.
