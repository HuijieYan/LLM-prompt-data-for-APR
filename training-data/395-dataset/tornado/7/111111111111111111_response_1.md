The bug appears to be in the `run_in_executor` method of the `IOLoop` class. The bug is related to the use of the `submit` method of the `executor`.

The error message indicates a `TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression`, which suggests that when attempting to use the `await` keyword on the result of `run_in_executor`, it is not recognizing the result as an awaitable object.

The bug is most likely caused by the fact that the `executor.submit` is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, which is not compatible with the `await` keyword in the async function.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `run_in_executor` method to return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object instead of the `concurrent.futures.Future`.

The corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.
    
        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    
        """
        if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")
    
        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor
    
        c_future = executor.submit(func, *args)
        t_future = tornado.concurrent.Future()
        t_future.set_result(c_future.result())

        return t_future
```

In the corrected code, we create a new `tornado.concurrent.Future` object and set its result to the result of the `concurrent.futures.Future` object returned by the `executor.submit` method.

This change ensures that the result of `run_in_executor` is a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object, which is compatible with the `await` keyword in async functions.
