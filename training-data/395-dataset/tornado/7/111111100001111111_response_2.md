The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect use of the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` to check if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is available. This condition will always evaluate to False because the name `ThreadPoolExecutor` exists and is not None. 

To fix this, we should use the `try-except` block to try to import `ThreadPoolExecutor` and if it fails, raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

        """
        try:
            from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
        except ImportError:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor

        return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
In the corrected code, we import `ThreadPoolExecutor` inside the `try-except` block. If the import is successful, the code continues execution. If the import fails (e.g., `ThreadPoolExecutor` is not available), a `RuntimeError` is raised.

This will fix the bug and ensure that the correct condition is used to check the availability of `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
