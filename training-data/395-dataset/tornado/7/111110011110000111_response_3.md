The error message indicates that a TypeError is raised when trying to use a Future object in an 'await' expression. This suggests that the run_in_executor function is not returning a Future object as expected.

Upon analyzing the run_in_executor method, it seems that the issue might be with the return statement. The return statement should return a Future object, but it is currently returning the result of executor.submit(). This will not yield a Future object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the return statement is not returning a Future object, causing the TypeError when trying to use the result in an 'await' expression.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the return statement to return the Future object obtained from executor.submit().

Here's the corrected code for the run_in_executor method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a concurrent.futures.Executor. If
    executor is None, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use functools.partial to pass keyword arguments to func.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

With this change, the run_in_executor method will now correctly return a Future object, resolving the TypeError issue observed in the test function.
