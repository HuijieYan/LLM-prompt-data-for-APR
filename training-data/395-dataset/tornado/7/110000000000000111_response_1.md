Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` as it should be checking if `executor` is `None` instead of checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is `None`.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` is always false because `ThreadPoolExecutor` is a class, and it will never be `None`. The intended logic was to check if the `executor` parameter is `None` instead.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The condition should be changed to check if the `executor` is `None` instead of checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is `None`. Additionally, we can remove the unnecessary check for `ThreadPoolExecutor` as it is not required.

Corrected code:
```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
