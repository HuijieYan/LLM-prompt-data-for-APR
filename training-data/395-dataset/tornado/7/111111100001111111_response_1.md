The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks for the presence of the ThreadPoolExecutor. The condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` will always return False as it compares the ThreadPoolExecutor object to None, which is incorrect.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the code tries to check the existence of ThreadPoolExecutor by comparing it to None using the is keyword, which is incorrect since ThreadPoolExecutor is not a variable but an undefined symbol in this context.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if ThreadPoolExecutor module is imported and make it available for use. If ThreadPoolExecutor is available, use it to create an executor for running the functions in a concurrent futures executor.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
