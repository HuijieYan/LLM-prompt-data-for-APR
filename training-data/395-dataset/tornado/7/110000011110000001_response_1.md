Potential error location: The issue might be with the `run_in_executor` method in the `IOLoop` class. It seems that the function is not handling the `executor` parameter correctly.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `run_in_executor` function is not properly handling the case when the `executor` is None. This leads to the `TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await'` error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `executor` is None and if it is, use the IO loop's default executor.
2. Use the correct future object to be compatible with the `await` expression.
3. Make sure to pass the `sync_func` and its arguments to the `executor.submit` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from tornado.process import cpu_count

class IOLoop:
    def __init__(self):
        self._executor = None

    def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

        """
        if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor

        return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
This should fix the bug and allow the `run_in_executor` function to work properly with the `await` expression.
