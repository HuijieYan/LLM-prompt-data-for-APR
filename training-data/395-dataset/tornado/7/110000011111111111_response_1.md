The error message indicates that a Future object is being used in an 'await' expression, which is not allowed. This suggests that the run_in_executor function is not returning the expected type of object for await.

The potential error location within the run_in_executor function is the return statement. It is currently returning executor.submit(func, *args), which returns a concurrent.futures.Future object, when it should be returning a tornado.concurrent.Future object.

The reason for the bug is that the run_in_executor function is not returning the expected type of future object. This causes an error when the future is being awaited in the test case.

To fix this bug, the run_in_executor function needs to return a tornado.concurrent.Future object instead of a concurrent.futures.Future object. This will ensure that it can be awaited correctly in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the run_in_executor function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return self.run_in_executor_with_future(executor, func, *args)


def run_in_executor_with_future(self, executor, func, *args):
    return concurrent.futures.Future(
        executor.submit(func, *args)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the run_in_executor function calls a new method run_in_executor_with_future, which returns a tornado.concurrent.Future object containing the result of executor.submit(func, *args). This ensures that the run_in_executor function returns the expected type of future object for use in await expressions.
