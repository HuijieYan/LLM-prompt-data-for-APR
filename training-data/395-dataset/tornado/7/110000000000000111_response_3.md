Potential Error:

The potential error in the provided function is in the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` It seems that it is trying to check if the ThreadPoolExecutor module is not None, however, it should be checking if `executor` is None instead.

Reason for the Bug:

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is None, which is not the correct way to determine if the executor is None.

Possible Approach to Fix the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the function to check if `executor` is None.

Corrected Code:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
