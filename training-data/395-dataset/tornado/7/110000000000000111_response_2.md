The potential error in the provided function lies in the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`. This condition is checking if the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class itself is None, which will always evaluate to False since `ThreadPoolExecutor` is a class and not a variable that can be None. 

The error occurs because the condition is not correctly checking if the `executor` is None, which is the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we can change the condition to check if the `executor` is None instead of checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
