The bug in the function `run_in_executor` arises from the incorrect condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` which is checking if the class `ThreadPoolExecutor` itself is None, which will always evaluate to False. This condition should be checking if `executor` is None instead.

This bug causes the function to set a default executor even when a custom executor is provided, which is not the intended behavior. 

To fix this bug, the condition should be changed to check if `executor` is None, and if it is, then set the default ThreadPoolExecutor.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
