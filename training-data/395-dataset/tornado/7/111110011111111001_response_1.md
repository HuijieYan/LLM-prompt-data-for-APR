The error message indicates that a TypeError is raised because the "Future" object cannot be used in an 'await' expression. This suggests that the function is returning a "Future" object instead of the expected values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement, where "executor.submit(func, *args)" is returning a "Future" object instead of the result of the function "func".

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function "run_in_executor" is not properly handling the execution and retrieval of the result from the concurrent futures executor.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the return statement of the "run_in_executor" function to await the result of the function execution using the concurrent futures executor.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return await executor.submit(func, *args)
```

By using the "await" keyword before the "executor.submit", the corrected function will properly await the result of the function execution using the concurrent futures executor. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the correct result is returned by the function.
