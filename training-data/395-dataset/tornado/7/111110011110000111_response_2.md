Potential Error Location:
The error may be related to the `run_in_executor` function inside the `IOLoop` class. The function returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, and the test function is trying to use `await` with the result of this function, resulting in a `TypeError`.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The `run_in_executor` function returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, which cannot be directly used with the `await` keyword in asynchronous functions. This leads to a `TypeError` when the test function attempts to await the result of the `run_in_executor` function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `run_in_executor` function should return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` or similar object that is compatible with the `await` keyword in asynchronous functions. This might involve modifying the `run_in_executor` function to wrap the `concurrent.futures.Future` in a `tornado.concurrent.Future` or using a different approach to handling the asynchronous execution of `sync_func`.

Corrected Code:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """
    Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    # Wrap the concurrent.futures.Future in a tornado.concurrent.Future
    return tornado.concurrent.Future(executor.submit(func, *args))
```
