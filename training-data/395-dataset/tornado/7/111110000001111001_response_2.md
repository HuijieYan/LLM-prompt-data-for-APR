1. The problem occurs in the `run_in_executor` method of the `IOLoop` class. This method is intended to run a function in a concurrent.futures.Executor, but it is not using the provided executor and has a condition checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is None, which is incorrect. 

2. The potential error location is the check `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`, which should be `if executor is None` instead. 

3. The bug is caused by incorrect conditional checks and misuse of the ThreadPoolExecutor. The condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` is not required as the `executor` parameter already handles the checking.

4. To fix the bug, we need to replace `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` with `if executor is None`. Additionally, we should remove the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` and proceed with creating a new ThreadPoolExecutor instance.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
