The potential error location in the problematic function is the check for the availability of ThreadPoolExecutor. 

The bug occurs because the check is supposed to verify if the ThreadPoolExecutor is available, but it currently checks if ThreadPoolExecutor is None, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should check if the executor is None and create a new ThreadPoolExecutor if it is, instead of the current approach.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.
    
        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    
        """
        from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, Executor

        if not isinstance(executor, Executor) and executor is not None:
            raise TypeError("Executor must be a concurrent.futures.Executor instance or None")

        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor

        return executor.submit(func, *args)

```
In the corrected code, we first import ThreadPoolExecutor and Executor from concurrent.futures. Then, we check if the executor is an instance of Executor and is not None, validating the type. If the executor is None, then we create a new ThreadPoolExecutor and use it for running the function.
