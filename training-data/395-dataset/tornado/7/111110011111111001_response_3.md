The error message `TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression` indicates that the Future object is being awaited in an async function, which is not allowed.

The potential error is occurring in the `run_in_executor` function where the Future object is being awaited.

The bug occurs because the `run_in_executor` function is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object instead of a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object. This causes an error when the returned Future object is awaited in an async function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `run_in_executor` function to return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object instead of a `concurrent.futures.Future` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    # Submit the function to the executor and return a tornado.concurrent.Future
    return self.submit(executor, func, *args)

def submit(self, executor, func, *args):
    # Create a tornado.concurrent.Future and submit the function to the executor
    future = Future()

    # Submit the function to the executor and set the result of the future when it's complete
    executor.submit(self._run_in_executor, future, func, *args)

    return future

def _run_in_executor(self, future, func, *args):
    # Run the function in the executor and set the result of the future when it's complete
    result = func(*args)
    future.set_result(result)
```

With these changes, the `run_in_executor` function now returns a proper `tornado.concurrent.Future` object, which can be awaited in an async function without causing a TypeError.
