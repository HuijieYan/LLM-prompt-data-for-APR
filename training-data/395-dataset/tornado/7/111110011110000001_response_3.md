The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to using a `Future` object in an 'await' expression. This indicates that there is an issue with the `run_in_executor` method of the `IOLoop` class.

The potential error location within the `run_in_executor` method is at the line where it returns a `Future` object using `executor.submit`, which may not be compatible with an 'await' expression.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run_in_executor` method is returning a `Future` object that is not compatible with the 'await' expression used in the test function.

To fix this bug, the `run_in_executor` method should return a `Future` object that is compatible with the 'await' expression used in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, Future

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... other code ...

    def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
        """
        if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor

        future = executor.submit(func, *args)
        return Future(future)
```

In the corrected code, the `run_in_executor` method returns a `Future` object created from the result of `executor.submit(func, *args)`. This ensures compatibility with the 'await' expression used in the test function and resolves the `TypeError` issue.
