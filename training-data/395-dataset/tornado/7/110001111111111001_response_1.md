The error message indicates that the `Future` object cannot be used in an 'await' expression. This suggests that the `IOLoop.run_in_executor` method is not returning the expected `Future` object that can be used with `await`.

The potential error location within the `run_in_executor` function is the line `return executor.submit(func, *args)`. It seems like `executor.submit` is returning a different type of `Future` object than the one expected by the test case.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of `concurrent.futures.Executor`, resulting in the function returning a different type of `Future` object than expected, which can't be used with `await`.

To fix this bug, the `concurrent.futures.Executor` should be used correctly to return a `Future` object that can be used with `await`. This may involve changing the way the `func` is executed within the executor.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return self.io_loop.run_in_executor(executor, func, *args)
```

In this corrected code, the `io_loop` is used to execute the function with the provided `executor` and arguments, and the correct `Future` object is returned, which can be used with `await`.
