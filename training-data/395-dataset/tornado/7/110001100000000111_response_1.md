Potential Error location: 

The potential error location is in the if statement checking for the existence of ThreadPoolExecutor. This condition is not correctly checking for the presence of the ThreadPoolExecutor library.

Reason for the bug: 

The condition to check for the existence of ThreadPoolExecutor is incorrect. It should be checking if the ThreadPoolExecutor is available in the concurrent.futures module.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 

- Import the ThreadPoolExecutor explicitly and check for its existence in the concurrent.futures module.
- Use a try-except block to catch the ImportError if ThreadPoolExecutor is not available.

Corrected code:

```python
import concurrent.futures

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
