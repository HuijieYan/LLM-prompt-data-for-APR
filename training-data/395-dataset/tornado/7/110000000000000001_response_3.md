Potential Error Location:
The if statement `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` is checking if the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class itself is None, which is incorrect. It should be checking if the `executor` parameter is None.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error occurs because the wrong condition is used to check if the executor is None. Additionally, the check for the availability of ThreadPoolExecutor is incorrect.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the if statement to check if the `executor` parameter is None.
2. Import the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class and use it to check if it is available.

Corrected Code:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# this is the corrected function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
