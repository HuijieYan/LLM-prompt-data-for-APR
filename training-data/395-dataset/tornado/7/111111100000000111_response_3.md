The potential error in the given function is with the check for the ThreadPoolExecutor. It seems like the intention is to check if the ThreadPoolExecutor class is available, but the check is currently incorrect.

The error occurs because the function is checking for the existence of ThreadPoolExecutor without actually importing it. Additionally, the check should be for the executor being None, not for ThreadPoolExecutor being None.

To fix the bug, the function needs to import the ThreadPoolExecutor and then correctly check if the executor is None. If it is None, it should create a new ThreadPoolExecutor.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
