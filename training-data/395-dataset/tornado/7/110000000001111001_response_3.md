Potential Error Location:
The if statement that checks if ThreadPoolExecutor is None is incorrectly implemented. It should be checking if the executor is None, not if ThreadPoolExecutor is None.

Reasons Behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is checking if the ThreadPoolExecutor class is None, rather than checking if the executor instance is None.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the executor is None, and not if ThreadPoolExecutor is None.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the case where concurrent.futures is not available.

Corrected Code:

```python
import concurrent.futures

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)

```
