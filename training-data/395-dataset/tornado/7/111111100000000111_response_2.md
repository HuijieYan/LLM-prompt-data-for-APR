Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:`. This condition is checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None, but it should be checking if the `executor` argument is None.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The buggy code is checking the wrong variable for None. This is causing the function to raise a RuntimeError even if an executor is provided.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the condition to check if the `executor` variable is None instead of `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
2. Remove the check for None entirely and handle the case where the `executor` is not provided separately.
3. Check if the `ThreadPoolExecutor` module is available before using it.

Corrected Code:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
