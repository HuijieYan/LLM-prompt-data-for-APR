The error message indicates that a `Future` object cannot be used in an 'await' expression. This error likely occurs due to the use of `executor.submit(func, *args)` in the `run_in_executor` function, which returns a `Future` object that cannot be directly awaited.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return executor.submit(func, *args)`.

The bug occurs because the `run_in_executor` function is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, which is different from the `tornado.concurrent.Future` object that is expected to work with `await`. Therefore, the returned `Future` object is incompatible with the 'await' expression, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, you can use the `IOLoop.run_in_executor` method directly, which returns a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object that is compatible with the 'await' expression.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return tornado.concurrent.Future(executor.submit(func, *args))
```

With this corrected code, the `run_in_executor` function will return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object that can be awaited without causing a TypeError.
