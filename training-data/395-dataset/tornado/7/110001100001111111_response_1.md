The error in the given code lies in the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:`. The check `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` doesn't correctly validate whether the `ThreadPoolExecutor` has been imported. Instead, you should import it from the `concurrent.futures` module and then check whether it is `None` or not.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_7/tornado/ioloop.py
from concurrent.futures.thread import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError("concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

With these changes, the function should now work correctly.
