The issue appears to be related to the function `run_in_executor` not returning the expected `Future` object that can be awaited. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to using a `Future` object in an await expression.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the problematic function `run_in_executor` is not correctly returning a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object, which is causing the error in the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement:
```python
return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
This code returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, whereas the correct behavior should be to return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `run_in_executor` is designed to run a function in a `concurrent.futures.Executor` and return a compatible `tornado.concurrent.Future` object. However, the existing implementation is not fulfilling this requirement.

To fix the bug, the `run_in_executor` function needs to be modified to return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object instead of a `concurrent.futures.Future` object. This can be achieved by using `tornado.concurrent.futures` module to create the `Future` object compatible with Tornado's event loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from tornado.concurrent import Future

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... other code ...

    def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor

        t_future = Future()

        def wrapper():
            result = executor.submit(func, *args).result()
            t_future.set_result(result)

        self.add_callback(wrapper)

        return t_future
```

With this corrected implementation, the `run_in_executor` function will return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object that can be awaited, resolving the `TypeError` issue observed in the test case.
