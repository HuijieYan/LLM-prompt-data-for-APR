The error message indicates that the object of type Future cannot be used in an 'await' expression. This suggests that the `run_in_executor` function is returning a Future object that is not compatible with the 'await' expression.

The `run_in_executor` function is responsible for submitting a function to the ThreadPoolExecutor and returning a Future object. This Future object should be compatible with the 'await' expression, but based on the error message, it seems that it is not.

To fix this issue, the `run_in_executor` function should return a Future object that is compatible with the 'await' expression. This can be achieved by properly handling the asyncio Future object.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
import concurrent.futures

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.
    
        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    
        """
        if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")
    
        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor
    
        future = executor.submit(func, *args)
        
        return concurrent.futures.Future(asyncio.ensure_future(future))
```

In the corrected code:
- We import the `concurrent.futures` module to handle the Future object.
- After submitting the function to the executor and obtaining the future, we use `asyncio.ensure_future` to create an asyncio Future object from the original Future object. This transformation makes the Future object compatible with the 'await' expression, addressing the original issue.
