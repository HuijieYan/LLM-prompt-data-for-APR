The potential error in the `run_in_executor` function is in the line `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:`.

The code is attempting to check if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None, but it should actually be checking if `executor` is None.

The reason for the bug is that the code is incorrectly checking the wrong variable for None.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` to `if executor is None:`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
