Potential error location: 
The if statement `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` is likely causing the error. It seems like the intention was to check if the `executor` is `None` rather than if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is `None`.

Reason behind the bug:
The function is incorrectly checking the availability of the ThreadPoolExecutor instead of checking the availability of the `executor` parameter that is passed to the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `executor` parameter is `None` instead of checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is `None`.
2. Use a try-except block to catch the AttributeError if ThreadPoolExecutor is not available.

Corrected code:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
  ```
