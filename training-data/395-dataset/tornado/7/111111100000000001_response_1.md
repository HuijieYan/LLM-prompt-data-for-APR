Issue:
The current code doesn't seem to correctly check for the existence of ThreadPoolExecutor before using it.

Reason for the bug:
The code checks if ThreadPoolExecutor is None, which is not the correct way to check if the module is available. This results in a RuntimeError being raised even when ThreadPoolExecutor is available.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if ThreadPoolExecutor is available using the correct method. We can use a try-except block to import ThreadPoolExecutor and handle the import error if it's not available.

Corrected code:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# ... (other code in the class)

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the check for ThreadPoolExecutor being None and instead directly imported it at the beginning of the file. This will avoid the RuntimeError being raised when ThreadPoolExecutor is available.
