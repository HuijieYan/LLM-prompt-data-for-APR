Potential error location:
The potential error within the `run_in_executor` function is the check for `ThreadPoolExecutor` being None. This check is incorrect because it is not checking whether the `executor` parameter is None, but is checking if the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class is None.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The code is incorrectly checking for the existence of `ThreadPoolExecutor` instead of checking if the `executor` parameter is None. This causes a RuntimeError to be raised even if an executor is provided.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `executor` parameter is None instead of checking for the existence of `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
2. Provide a default value for the `executor` parameter, so that if it is not provided, the default executor of the IO loop will be used.

Corrected code:
```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
