The bug seems to be in the run_in_executor method of the IOLoop class. The error message suggests that a Future object is being used in an 'await' expression, which is not allowed.

It appears that the function run_in_executor is returning a concurrent.futures.Future object, which is not compatible with the context in which it is being used in the test. Instead, it should return a tornado.concurrent.Future object, which is compatible with 'await' expressions.

To fix this bug, the run_in_executor function should be modified to return a tornado.concurrent.Future object. This can be achieved by calling the set_result method of a tornado.concurrent.Future object inside the run_in_executor function, passing the result of the concurrent.futures.Future object.

Here's the corrected code for the run_in_executor method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    c_future = executor.submit(func, *args)
    t_future = concurrent.Future()

    # Set the result of the concurrent Future on the tornado Future
    t_future.set_result(c_future.result())

    return t_future
```

With this correction, the run_in_executor method will return a tornado.concurrent.Future object, which should resolve the TypeError and allow the test case to pass.
