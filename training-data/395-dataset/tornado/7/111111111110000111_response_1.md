The error message implies that the `run_in_executor` method is returning an object of type `concurrent.futures.Future` which cannot be used in an await expression.

The potential error location in the code is where the `run_in_executor` method is expected to return a result immediately instead of a `concurrent.futures.Future` object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run_in_executor` method is not returning the expected result, but rather returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object.

To fix this bug, the `run_in_executor` method should be modified to return the result directly instead of a `concurrent.futures.Future` object.

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args).result()
```
