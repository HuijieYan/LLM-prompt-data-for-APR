Potential error location: The if statement comparing ThreadPoolExecutor to None is incorrect. It should be checking if the executor variable is None, not the ThreadPoolExecutor class.

Reason for the bug: The function is erroneously checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is None instead of checking if the executor variable is None. This will result in an error when the function is called with a None executor.

Possible approach to fix the bug: Change the if statement condition to check if the executor variable is None. This will ensure that the correct behavior is followed when the executor is not provided.

Corrected code:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
