The error message suggests that a `Future` object is being used in an `await` expression, which is not allowed. This indicates that the `run_in_executor` method is returning a `Future` object instead of the expected result.

The potential error within the `run_in_executor` method is the line:
```python
return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
This line is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object instead of waiting for the `func` to complete and return its result.

The reason behind this bug is that `executor.submit` returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object representing the execution of the `func` in the executor. However, the method is expected to return the result of the execution of `func` instead.

To fix this bug, the method should wait for the `concurrent.futures.Future` object to complete and return its result.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = executor.submit(func, *args)
    return future.result()  # Wait for the future to complete and return its result
```
