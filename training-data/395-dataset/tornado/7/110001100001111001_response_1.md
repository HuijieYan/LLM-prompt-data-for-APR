Potential error location: 
The conditional check `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` is incorrect. It should be `if executor is None:`

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The conditional check is incorrectly verifying the existence of the variable `ThreadPoolExecutor` instead of `executor`. This results in the function always raising a `RuntimeError`.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Replace the incorrect conditional check with the correct one, which verifies the existence of the `executor` variable.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_7/tornado/ioloop.py

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
