Potential error location: 
The potential error in the `run_in_executor` function is the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`, which checks if the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class is None. 

Reason for the bug:
The condition is checking if the class `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None, which will always evaluate to False because the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class is not directly assigned to None. This means that the condition will never raise the `RuntimeError` as intended.

Approach for fixing the bug:
The correct approach is to check if the `concurrent.futures` module is available, and if not, raise a `RuntimeError`. Additionally, the code should also check if the `executor` parameter is None and assign the default executor if necessary.

Corrected code:

```python
import concurrent.futures

# this is the corrected function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if concurrent.futures is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
