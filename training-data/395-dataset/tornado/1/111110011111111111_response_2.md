The error message from the test function indicates that the `read_message` method of the WebSocket object returned `None` instead of the expected value "hello". This indicates that the `set_nodelay` method is not functioning correctly, which is consistent with the assertion failure in the issue description.

The potential error location is within the `set_nodelay` method of the `WebSocketHandler` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `set_nodelay` function is not properly setting the no-delay flag for the stream, leading to unexpected behavior when reading messages from the WebSocket.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `set_nodelay` method correctly sets the no-delay flag for the stream.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if hasattr(self, 'stream') and self.stream is not None:  # Check if stream exists
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        # Handle the case where stream does not exist
        raise AttributeError("Stream does not exist. Unable to set nodelay flag.")
```

In the corrected code:
1. We first check if the `stream` attribute exists and is not `None` using `hasattr` and `self.stream is not None` to avoid the assertion failure.
2. If the stream exists, we call `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)` to set the no-delay flag for the stream.
3. If the stream does not exist, we raise an `AttributeError` to indicate that the stream does not exist and we are unable to set the no-delay flag.

This correction handles the case where the stream might not exist, preventing the assertion failure and ensuring that the no-delay flag is set appropriately for the WebSocket stream.
