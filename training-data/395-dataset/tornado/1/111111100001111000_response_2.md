        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
        the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.

        See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

        if isinstance(self.stream, NoDelayHandler):
            self.stream.set_nodelay(value)

In the corrected function, an additional check is added to ensure that the `self.stream` is an instance of `NoDelayHandler`, and then the `set_nodelay` method of the `NoDelayHandler` class is invoked.
