The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to set the nodelay flag for the WebSocket stream, but it is not handling the case where `self.stream` is None.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not include any handling for the case where `self.stream` is None, which can lead to a NoneType error when trying to call the `set_nodelay` method on `self.stream`.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that `self.stream` is not None before trying to call the `set_nodelay` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    """
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
