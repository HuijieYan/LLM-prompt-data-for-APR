The error occurs in the `set_nodelay` method of the `WebSocketHandler` class. The method tries to assert that `self.stream` is not None before calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`. However, it seems that `self.stream` is not being initialized properly or is None when the `set_nodelay` method is called.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.stream` is properly initialized before calling `set_nodelay`. We can initialize `self.stream` in the `open` method of the `WebSocketHandler` class, which is the standard method for WebSocket initialization.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is None:
        raise RuntimeError("WebSocket stream is not initialized")
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

By adding a check for `self.stream` and raising an error if it's not initialized, we can prevent the assertion failure and ensure that the `set_nodelay` method works as intended.
