The error occurs in the `test_nodelay` function of the WebSocketTest class. The error message states that the actual result obtained from `ws.read_message()` is `None`, whereas the expected value is `"hello"`. This indicates that the `ws.read_message()` method is not providing the expected result, which can be traced back to the `set_nodelay` method in the `WebSocketHandler` class.

Upon review of the `set_nodelay` method, it seems that the bug is likely occurring due to the `self.stream` attribute being `None`. This is because the method attempts to access `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`, but there is no check in place to ensure that `self.stream` is not `None` before making this call.

To fix this bug, we should implement a proper check for the existence of `self.stream` before attempting to call `set_nodelay` on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent. This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs. To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        # Handle the case when self.stream is None
        raise ValueError("No stream available to set nodelay")
```
