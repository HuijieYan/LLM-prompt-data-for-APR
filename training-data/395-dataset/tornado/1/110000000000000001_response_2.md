The potential error in the given code is that the `set_nodelay` method is referring to `self.stream` without being defined within the method. This is likely causing the assertion error when the method is called.

To fix this, the `self.stream` attribute should be defined within the class containing the `set_nodelay` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if hasattr(self, 'stream') and self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
