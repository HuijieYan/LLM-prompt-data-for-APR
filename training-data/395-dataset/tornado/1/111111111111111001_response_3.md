The provided function `set_nodelay` is attempting to set the no-delay flag for the WebSocket stream. The bug in the function is that it is not actually setting the no-delay flag correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior when sending and receiving messages.

The error message from the test function indicates that the function `ws.read_message()` is returning `None` instead of the expected message "hello". This suggests that the message is not being read correctly from the WebSocket connection.

The potential error location within the `set_nodelay` function is the line `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`. This is where the function attempts to set the no-delay flag, but it seems to be failing to do so effectively.

The reason behind the bug is that the `set_nodelay` function is not properly accessing the WebSocket stream and setting the no-delay flag.

To fix the bug, proper access to the WebSocket stream and setting the no-delay flag should be ensured. This can be achieved by using the WebSocket connection object directly to set the no-delay flag.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.ws_connection is not None
    self.ws_connection.set_nodelay(value)
```

In this corrected code, the WebSocket connection object `self.ws_connection` is used to set the no-delay flag, ensuring that it is applied to the correct stream.
