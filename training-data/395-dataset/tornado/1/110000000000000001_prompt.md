Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.stream is not None
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
