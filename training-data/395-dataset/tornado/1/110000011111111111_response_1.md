The error message indicates that the assertion `assert self.stream is not None` in the `set_nodelay` method is failing, which means that `self.stream` is `None`. This is likely the cause of the bug.

The bug occurs because the `set_nodelay` method is assuming that `self.stream` is not None, but it is not being properly initialized or set in the code provided.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.stream` is properly initialized before calling `set_nodelay`. This could be done in the constructor or any other initialization method of the class.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
# corrected function
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Stream is not initialized")
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `self.stream` is not None before calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`. If `self.stream` is None, a `ValueError` is raised to signal that the stream is not properly initialized.
