The bug in the provided code is that the `set_nodelay` method is defined twice in the `WebSocketHandler` class. This will cause a conflict and ambiguity when calling the method.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the duplicate definition of the `set_nodelay` method and define it only once with the correct implementation.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent. This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs. To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    # Assuming self.stream is the correct attribute to access the WebSocket connection
    assert self.stream is not None
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

By removing the duplicate method definition and keeping only the corrected implementation of `set_nodelay`, the bug will be fixed.
