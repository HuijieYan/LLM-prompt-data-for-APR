The error occurs in the `set_nodelay` function of the `WebSocketHandler` class. The error message indicates an assertion failure at the line `assert self.stream is not None`.

The reason behind this bug is that the `stream` attribute is not being properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function. This leads to the assertion failure when the function is called.

To fix this bug, the `stream` attribute needs to be properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function. This can be done by ensuring that the `stream` attribute is set in the WebSocketHandler class.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
class WebSocketHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
        """
        Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
        the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.

        See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

        .. versionadded:: 3.1
        """
        if not hasattr(self, 'stream') or self.stream is None:
            # Initialize the stream attribute if not already initialized
            self.stream = self.request.connection.stream
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `stream` attribute exists and is not None. If it is not initialized, we set it to `self.request.connection.stream` before calling the `set_nodelay` function. This ensures that the `stream` attribute is properly initialized before its use in `set_nodelay`.
