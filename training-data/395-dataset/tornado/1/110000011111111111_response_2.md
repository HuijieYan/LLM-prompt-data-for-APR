The error message `AssertionError: None != 'hello'` indicates that the `ws.read_message()` is returning `None` instead of the expected value "hello".

The potential error location within the `set_nodelay` function is the `assert self.stream is not None` statement. This assertion is causing the function to fail if `self.stream` is `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.stream` might not be initialized properly before calling the `set_nodelay` function, resulting in the assertion failure.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that `self.stream` is properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
       raise ValueError("Stream is not initialized")
```

In the corrected code, I added a check to ensure that `self.stream` is not `None` before calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`. If `self.stream` is `None`, a `ValueError` is raised indicating that the stream is not initialized.
