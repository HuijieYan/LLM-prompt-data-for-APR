The potential error location within the `set_nodelay` function is the line that sets the nodelay flag on the stream: `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`. This line is likely the cause of the bug because it's not handling the `WebSocketProtocol13` object correctly and is not setting the nodelay flag as intended.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `set_nodelay` function is not handling the `WebSocketProtocol13` object properly. The `WebSocketProtocol13` object is not being accessed in the set_nodelay method and the nodelay flag is not being set on the WebSocket stream.

To fix the bug, the `set_nodelay` function should be updated to handle the `WebSocketProtocol13` object and set the nodelay flag as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent. This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs. To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if hasattr(self, 'stream'):
        if isinstance(self.stream, tornado.websocket.WebSocketProtocol13):
            self.stream.socket.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, value)
        else:
            assert False, "Stream is not an instance of WebSocketProtocol13"
    else:
        assert False, "Stream does not exist"
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the object has the attribute `stream`, and if so, we check if it's an instance of `WebSocketProtocol13`. If both conditions are met, we set the nodelay flag on the stream's socket using `setsockopt`. If the conditions are not met, we raise an assertion error to indicate a problem with the stream object. Additionally, we raise an assertion error if the stream does not exist at all. This implementation ensures that the nodelay flag is being set appropriately for the WebSocketProtocol13 object.
