The error occurs in the set_nodelay function of the WebSocketHandler class in tornado/websocket.py. The error message indicates that the assertion "self.stream is not None" is failing, which means that self.stream is None when set_nodelay is called.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line "assert self.stream is not None" in the set_nodelay function. This assertion is causing the function to fail when self.stream is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that self.stream is not being properly initialized before set_nodelay is called. This could be due to a change in Tornado 6.0 that affects the initialization flow of the WebSocketHandler class.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that self.stream is properly initialized before set_nodelay is called. This may involve modifying the initialization process of the WebSocketHandler class to ensure that self.stream is not None when set_nodelay is called.

Here's the corrected code for the set_nodelay function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent. This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs. To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is not None:  # Check if self.stream is not None
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        # Handle the case where self.stream is None
        raise ValueError("Cannot set nodelay as self.stream is not initialized")
```
