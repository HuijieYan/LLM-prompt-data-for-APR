Potential Error Location: The error is occurring in the `set_nodelay` method of the `WebsocketHandler` class in the `tornado/websocket.py` file.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `assert self.stream is not None` statement is failing, indicating that the `self.stream` attribute is `None` when it should not be.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `self.stream` attribute is being properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` method.
2. Ensure that the `set_nodelay` method is being called after the websocket connection is established, as mentioned in the function's docstring.

Corrected Code:
```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    if self.stream is not None:  # Check if self.stream is initialized
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
