Potential error location: The indentation of the code is incorrect, which is causing the function definition to be nested within the original function.

Reason behind the bug: The indentation of the function "set_nodelay" is incorrect, causing it to be treated as a nested function instead of a standalone method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The function "set_nodelay" needs to be properly aligned with the class scope and the existing function "set_nodelay". 

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_1/tornado/websocket.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# this is the corrected function
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.
