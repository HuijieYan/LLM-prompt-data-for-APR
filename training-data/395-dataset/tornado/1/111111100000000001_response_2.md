The potential error in the provided code is that the `set_nodelay` method is defined twice in the class `WebSocketHandler`. The second definition of the method overrides the first one without implementing any new functionality. This results in the second definition of `set_nodelay` being redundant and causing confusion.

To fix this bug, the second definition of the `set_nodelay` method should be removed, and the intended functionality should be included in the first definition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_1/tornado/websocket.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.stream is not None
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

The redundant second definition of `set_nodelay` has been removed, and the comments and functionality from the second definition have been included in the first definition.
