The error occurs due to the presence of an assertion in the `set_nodelay` function, which checks whether `self.stream` is not None. If it is None, the assertion fails and an error is raised.

To fix this bug, we can remove the assertion and handle the case where `self.stream` is None by raising an appropriate exception or returning early from the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is None:
        raise ValueError("Stream is not initialized")
    
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
