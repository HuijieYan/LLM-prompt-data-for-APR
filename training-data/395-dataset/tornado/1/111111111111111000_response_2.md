        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
        the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.stream.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.

        See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

        assert self.stream is not None
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    
```
The `set_nodelay` method inside the `WebSocketHandler` class has been fixed by removing the redundant declaration and ensuring the correct usage of `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`.
