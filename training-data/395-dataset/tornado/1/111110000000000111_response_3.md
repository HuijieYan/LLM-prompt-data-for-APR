The error in the function set_nodelay is due to the assertion `assert self.stream is not None`. This assertion is causing a failure in Tornado 6.0. It seems like the `self.stream` is not being initialized properly or it's None when the set_nodelay function is called.

To fix this bug, the initialization of `self.stream` needs to be ensured before calling the set_nodelay function. One way to do this is to initialize `self.stream` in the `__init__` method of the WebSocketHandler class.

Here is the corrected code for the set_nodelay function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        raise Exception("Stream is not initialized")
```

In this corrected code, a check is added to ensure that `self.stream` is not None before calling the `set_nodelay` method on it. If it is None, an exception is raised to indicate that the stream is not initialized. This will prevent the assertion failure.
