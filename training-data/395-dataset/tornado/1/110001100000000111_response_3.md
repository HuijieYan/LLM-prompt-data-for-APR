The error is occurring in the `set_nodelay` method of the `WebsocketHandler` class in the `tornado/websocket.py` file. The error message indicates that the code is raising an assertion failure because `self.stream` is `None`.

The reason for this bug could be that the `self.stream` attribute is not being properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` method.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `self.stream` attribute is properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_1/tornado/websocket.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Stream is not initialized")
