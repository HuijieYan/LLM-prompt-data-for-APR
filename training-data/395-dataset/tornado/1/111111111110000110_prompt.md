class WebSocketHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    """
    Subclass this class to create a basic WebSocket handler.
    
    Override `on_message` to handle incoming messages, and use
    `write_message` to send messages to the client. You can also
    override `open` and `on_close` to handle opened and closed
    connections.
    
    Custom upgrade response headers can be sent by overriding
    `~tornado.web.RequestHandler.set_default_headers` or
    `~tornado.web.RequestHandler.prepare`.
    
    See http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/ for details on the
    JavaScript interface.  The protocol is specified at
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455.
    
    Here is an example WebSocket handler that echos back all received messages
    back to the client:
    
    .. testcode::
    
      class EchoWebSocket(tornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler):
          def open(self):
              print("WebSocket opened")
    
          def on_message(self, message):
              self.write_message(u"You said: " + message)
    
          def on_close(self):
              print("WebSocket closed")
    
    .. testoutput::
       :hide:
    
    WebSockets are not standard HTTP connections. The "handshake" is
    HTTP, but after the handshake, the protocol is
    message-based. Consequently, most of the Tornado HTTP facilities
    are not available in handlers of this type. The only communication
    methods available to you are `write_message()`, `ping()`, and
    `close()`. Likewise, your request handler class should implement
    `open()` method rather than ``get()`` or ``post()``.
    
    If you map the handler above to ``/websocket`` in your application, you can
    invoke it in JavaScript with::
    
      var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8888/websocket");
      ws.onopen = function() {
         ws.send("Hello, world");
      };
      ws.onmessage = function (evt) {
         alert(evt.data);
      };
    
    This script pops up an alert box that says "You said: Hello, world".
    
    Web browsers allow any site to open a websocket connection to any other,
    instead of using the same-origin policy that governs other network
    access from javascript.  This can be surprising and is a potential
    security hole, so since Tornado 4.0 `WebSocketHandler` requires
    applications that wish to receive cross-origin websockets to opt in
    by overriding the `~WebSocketHandler.check_origin` method (see that
    method's docs for details).  Failure to do so is the most likely
    cause of 403 errors when making a websocket connection.
    
    When using a secure websocket connection (``wss://``) with a self-signed
    certificate, the connection from a browser may fail because it wants
    to show the "accept this certificate" dialog but has nowhere to show it.
    You must first visit a regular HTML page using the same certificate
    to accept it before the websocket connection will succeed.
    
    If the application setting ``websocket_ping_interval`` has a non-zero
    value, a ping will be sent periodically, and the connection will be
    closed if a response is not received before the ``websocket_ping_timeout``.
    
    Messages larger than the ``websocket_max_message_size`` application setting
    (default 10MiB) will not be accepted.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.5
       Added ``websocket_ping_interval``, ``websocket_ping_timeout``, and
       ``websocket_max_message_size``.

        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize

        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
WebsocketHandler.set_nodelay results in assertion failure
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
In previous versions of Torando, WebsocketHandler.set_nodelay could be called from open to set the nodelay option. In Tornado 6.0, this results in an assertion failure:

File ".../tornado/websocket.py", line 561, in set_nodelay
assert self.stream is not None
```
