Potential error location: The issue is occurring at the line `assert self.stream is not None` inside the `set_nodelay` function.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the `self.stream` attribute is not being properly initialized or passed to the `set_nodelay` function. This assertion is checking whether the `self.stream` attribute is not None before proceeding with setting the nodelay option, and it is failing because `self.stream` is None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `self.stream` attribute is properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function.
2. Check the implementation of the `WebSocketProtocol13` and `NoDelayHandler` classes to ensure that the `self.stream` attribute is being set correctly.
3. Revise the logic within the `set_nodelay` function to handle cases where `self.stream` may be None.

Corrected code:
```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.
