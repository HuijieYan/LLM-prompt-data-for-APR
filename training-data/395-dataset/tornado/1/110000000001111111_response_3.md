The issue is occurring in the `set_nodelay` function of the `WebsocketHandler` class in Tornado 6.0. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert self.stream is not None` is failing, which means that the `self.stream` is None when it should not be.

The potential error location within the function is the assertion itself, which is checking the existence of the `self.stream` object.

The bug is occurring because in Tornado 6.0, the implementation of the `set_nodelay` function has changed, and it now expects the `self.stream` to be initialized before calling `set_nodelay`.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `self.stream` is initialized before calling `set_nodelay` and handle the scenario where it might not be initialized.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        # Handle the scenario where self.stream is not initialized
        # This could be raising an exception, logging an error, or other error-handling logic
        pass
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `self.stream` is not None before calling `set_nodelay`. If `self.stream` is None, we can handle this situation based on the specific requirements of the application, such as raising an exception, logging an error, or any other error-handling logic.
