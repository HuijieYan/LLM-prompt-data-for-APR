The error occurs in the `set_nodelay` method of the `WebsocketHandler` class in the `tornado/websocket.py` file. The error message indicates that the `assert self.stream is not None` statement is failing, which suggests that `self.stream` is None when the `set_nodelay` method is called.

The potential error location is within the `set_nodelay` method where `self.stream` is being accessed.

The bug occurs because `self.stream` is not initialized or set to a value when the `set_nodelay` method is called.

To fix the bug, the `self.stream` attribute needs to be properly initialized or set before calling the `set_nodelay` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    """
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        # Handle the case when self.stream is None, possibly by raising an exception or logging an error
        # Example:
        raise ValueError("self.stream is not initialized")
```
