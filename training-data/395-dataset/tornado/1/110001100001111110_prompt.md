Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_1/tornado/websocket.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
        """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.
    
        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
        the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.
    
        See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
WebsocketHandler.set_nodelay results in assertion failure
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
In previous versions of Torando, WebsocketHandler.set_nodelay could be called from open to set the nodelay option. In Tornado 6.0, this results in an assertion failure:

File ".../tornado/websocket.py", line 561, in set_nodelay
assert self.stream is not None
```
