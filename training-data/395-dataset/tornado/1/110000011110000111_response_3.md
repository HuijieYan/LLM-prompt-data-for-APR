The error message indicates that the assertion `self.stream is not None` in the `set_nodelay` function is failing. This means that the `self.stream` is not initialized when the `set_nodelay` function is called.

The potential error location within the `set_nodelay` function is the line `assert self.stream is not None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.stream` is not initialized at the time when the `set_nodelay` function is called, which causes the assertion to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.stream` is properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:
```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    if self.stream:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Stream is not initialized")
