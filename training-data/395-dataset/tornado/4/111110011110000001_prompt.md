# Buggy function source code
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class StaticFileHandler(RequestHandler):
    """
    A simple handler that can serve static content from a directory.
    
    A `StaticFileHandler` is configured automatically if you pass the
    ``static_path`` keyword argument to `Application`.  This handler
    can be customized with the ``static_url_prefix``, ``static_handler_class``,
    and ``static_handler_args`` settings.
    
    To map an additional path to this handler for a static data directory
    you would add a line to your application like::
    
        application = web.Application([
            (r"/content/(.*)", web.StaticFileHandler, {"path": "/var/www"}),
        ])
    
    The handler constructor requires a ``path`` argument, which specifies the
    local root directory of the content to be served.
    
    Note that a capture group in the regex is required to parse the value for
    the ``path`` argument to the get() method (different than the constructor
    argument above); see `URLSpec` for details.
    
    To serve a file like ``index.html`` automatically when a directory is
    requested, set ``static_handler_args=dict(default_filename="index.html")``
    in your application settings, or add ``default_filename`` as an initializer
    argument for your ``StaticFileHandler``.
    
    To maximize the effectiveness of browser caching, this class supports
    versioned urls (by default using the argument ``?v=``).  If a version
    is given, we instruct the browser to cache this file indefinitely.
    `make_static_url` (also available as `RequestHandler.static_url`) can
    be used to construct a versioned url.
    
    This handler is intended primarily for use in development and light-duty
    file serving; for heavy traffic it will be more efficient to use
    a dedicated static file server (such as nginx or Apache).  We support
    the HTTP ``Accept-Ranges`` mechanism to return partial content (because
    some browsers require this functionality to be present to seek in
    HTML5 audio or video).
    
    **Subclassing notes**
    
    This class is designed to be extensible by subclassing, but because
    of the way static urls are generated with class methods rather than
    instance methods, the inheritance patterns are somewhat unusual.
    Be sure to use the ``@classmethod`` decorator when overriding a
    class method.  Instance methods may use the attributes ``self.path``
    ``self.absolute_path``, and ``self.modified``.
    
    Subclasses should only override methods discussed in this section;
    overriding other methods is error-prone.  Overriding
    ``StaticFileHandler.get`` is particularly problematic due to the
    tight coupling with ``compute_etag`` and other methods.
    
    To change the way static urls are generated (e.g. to match the behavior
    of another server or CDN), override `make_static_url`, `parse_url_path`,
    `get_cache_time`, and/or `get_version`.
    
    To replace all interaction with the filesystem (e.g. to serve
    static content from a database), override `get_content`,
    `get_content_size`, `get_modified_time`, `get_absolute_path`, and
    `validate_absolute_path`.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 3.1
       Many of the methods for subclasses were added in Tornado 3.1.
