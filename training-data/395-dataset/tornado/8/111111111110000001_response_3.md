The error message indicates that the expected response status code is 400, but the actual response status code is 500. This suggests that the `accept_connection` function is not working as expected, causing the server to respond with an error status code (500) instead of the expected status code (400).

The potential error location within the `accept_connection` function is in the try-except block. The try block calls `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions, and the except block catches ValueError and logs a message, but it does not handle the response status code.

The reason behind the bug is that the `accept_connection` function does not handle the response status code explicitly. When an exception occurs and the code inside the except block is executed, it does not change the response status code from the default 500 to the expected 400.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` function should explicitly set the response status code to 400 after catching the ValueError and logging the message.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self.set_status(400)  # Set the response status code to 400
        self.finish()  # Finish the request handling
```

By setting the response status code to 400 and finishing the request handling after catching the ValueError, the corrected code ensures that the server responds with the expected status code when a malformed WebSocket request is received.
