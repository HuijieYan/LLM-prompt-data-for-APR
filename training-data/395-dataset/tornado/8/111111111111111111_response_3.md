The error occurs because the `accept_connection` function in the `WebSocketProtocol13` class is calling the `_abort` function immediately if there are missing required headers before the handshake, without first checking if self.stream is null. This causes an AttributeError when `self.stream.close()` is called in the `_abort` function.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.stream` is not null before calling `self.stream.close()` in the `_abort` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        if self.stream is not None:  # Check if self.stream is not null
            self._abort()
        return
```
