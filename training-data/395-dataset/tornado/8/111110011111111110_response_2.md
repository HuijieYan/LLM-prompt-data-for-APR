# Buggy function source code
class WebSocketProtocol13(WebSocketProtocol):
    """
    Implementation of the WebSocket protocol from RFC 6455.
    
    This class supports versions 7 and 8 of the protocol in addition to the
    final version 13.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def _handle_websocket_headers(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _accept_connection(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def accept_connection(self):
        try:
            self._handle_websocket_headers()
            self._accept_connection()
        except ValueError:
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                        exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
            self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
```
The fix involves making sure the close method is called on a valid object, which should resolve the AttributeError when the WebSocket client misses the required header.
