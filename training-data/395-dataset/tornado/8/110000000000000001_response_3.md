Potential error:
- The try-except block is catching a ValueError, but it is not handling any other type of exception. If any other type of exception occurs, it will not be caught properly.

Reason behind the bug:
- The function is catching a specific type of exception (ValueError) but does not handle any other exceptions that might occur during the execution of `_handle_websocket_headers()` or `_accept_connection()`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Modify the except block to catch a more general exception (e.g., `except Exception`) to handle any type of exception that might occur.
- Log the specific exception that occurred to aid in troubleshooting.
- Consider adding additional error handling and recovery logic based on the specific exceptions that can occur.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Error accepting connection: {}".format(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
