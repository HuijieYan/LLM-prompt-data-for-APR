The error occurs in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. When the required headers for the WebSocket handshake are missing, a `ValueError` is raised. However, in the `except` block of the `accept_connection` method, the `_abort` method is called, and then `return` is used, which prevents the subsequent lines of code from executing.

One possible approach to fix this issue is to handle the error and its consequences within the `accept_connection` method itself, without explicitly returning from the `except` block.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()

        # Handle the consequence of the error without returning
        self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
        self.close()
```

In the corrected code, after calling the `_abort` method, the consequent actions to handle the error are taken without explicitly returning from the `except` block. This should resolve the `AttributeError` and handle the missing WebSocket headers appropriately.
