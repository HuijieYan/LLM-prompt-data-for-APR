The potential error in the provided function is that it catches ValueError but doesn't handle any other possible exceptions. This means that if any other exceptions occur in either self._handle_websocket_headers() or self._accept_connection(), they will not be caught and will cause the function to crash.

To fix this, we can catch a more general Exception instead of just ValueError. This will ensure that any exceptions thrown by the two inner functions are caught and handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Error accepting WebSocket connection: {}".format(str(e)),
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
