The test case is trying to simulate a scenario where the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header is missing from the request, which should result in a 400 Bad Request response. However, it is currently returning a 500 Internal Server Error, indicating that the buggy function 'accept_connection' is not handling the missing websocket key case correctly.

The potential error location within the 'accept_connection' function is the exception handling block which only catches 'ValueError' exceptions. Since the missing websocket key results in a different type of error, the code inside the except block is not getting executed, leading to an incorrect response.

The bug occurs because the except block only catches 'ValueError' exceptions, and does not account for other potential exceptions that may occur during the execution of 'self._handle_websocket_headers()' and 'self._accept_connection()' functions.

To fix the bug, we need to update the exception handling to catch the more generic 'Exception' type, which will handle all possible exceptions that may occur during the execution of the internal functions. Additionally, we should also modify the return value to return the appropriate HTTP response code (400 in this case) when there is a malformed WebSocket request.

Here's the corrected code for the 'accept_connection' function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return 400  # 400 Bad Request
```

With this correction, the 'accept_connection' function should now handle all possible exceptions that may occur and return the correct HTTP response code when there is a malformed WebSocket request.
