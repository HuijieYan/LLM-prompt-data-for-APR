The potential error location within the problematic function is the try-except block. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the except block catches any ValueError exception, including the one raised when the response code is 500. As a result, the test case fails because the caught exception does not match the expected 400 response code.

To fix the bug, the except block should be modified to catch the specific exception raised when the response code is 500.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except HTTPError as e:
        if e.code == 500:
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                          exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
```
