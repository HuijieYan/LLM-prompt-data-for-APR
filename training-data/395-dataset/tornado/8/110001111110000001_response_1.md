The test case is checking for a response code of 400, but it is receiving a response code of 500, which indicates an internal server error. This points to a problem within the WebSocket handling that leads to an incorrect response code.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `accept_connection` method. It seems that the handling of the WebSocket headers and the connection itself are not properly being executed, leading to an internal server error.

The reason behind this bug could be that the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` methods are not being called properly within the `accept_connection` method, or there might be an issue with the exception handling.

To fix this bug, the `accept_connection` method should be modified to ensure that both `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` are called properly and that exception handling is done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug(f"WebSocket connection failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

With these changes, the WebSocket headers will be properly handled, the connection will be accepted, and any exceptions will be caught and logged.
