The error occurs when the WebSocket handshake is initiated, but the client's request is missing the required headers. As a result, the server raises a ValueError with the message "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers."

The error is likely occurring in the `_handle_websocket_headers` method or the `_accept_connection` method called within the `accept_connection` method. When the required headers are missing, the method should handle the error gracefully without attempting to access attributes that may not be initialized yet.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `accept_connection` method to handle the ValueError without raising an AttributeError.

Here is the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
    except AttributeError:
        # Handle AttributeError gracefully, possibly by logging the error
        gen_log.debug("AttributeError occurred", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
```

By adding an additional `except AttributeError` block, we can catch the AttributeError that occurs when trying to access `self.stream` before it has been initialized. This change will prevent the server from crashing when the client's request is missing the required WebSocket headers.
