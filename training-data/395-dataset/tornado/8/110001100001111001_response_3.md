The buggy function `accept_connection` is attempting to handle the `ValueError` exception, but the actual exception being raised is not `ValueError`. Instead, the `tornado.websocket.WebSocketProtocol13` object is being passed to the function, and the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions are being called within a try-except block. It seems that the intent of the author was to catch any exceptions thrown by these functions, but the `except` block is only looking for `ValueError`, which is not the correct type of exception being thrown.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `except` block to catch all exceptions by using a more general `except` block without specifying a particular exception type.

```python
# Updated fixed function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

By using a more general `except` block that catches all exceptions (`Exception as e`), we can ensure that any exception raised by `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` will be handled properly.
