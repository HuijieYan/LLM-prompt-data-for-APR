The potential error in the function "accept_connection" is that it catches a ValueError exception, but it's not clear in which part of the code this exception is raised. It seems that the intention is to handle the case of a malformed WebSocket request.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the except block to handle the specific exception that is expected to be raised when there's a malformed WebSocket request.

Here's the corrected code for the "accept_connection" function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except MalformedRequestError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % str(e),
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
```

In this corrected code, we assume that there is a custom exception class called "MalformedRequestError" that is raised when a malformed WebSocket request is received. This is just an example, and you should replace "MalformedRequestError" with the actual exception that is raised in your code when a malformed WebSocket request is detected.
