The error seems to occur in the `_accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. When the required headers are missing, it raises a `ValueError`, and the `_abort` function is called immediately. However, before the handshake, there is no `self.stream` and the `_abort` function tries to close it, causing an `AttributeError`. This bug is due to the premature call of `_abort` before the handshake is completed.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `accept_connection` function to handle the missing/invalid headers before calling `_accept_connection` and catching the `ValueError` at an appropriate location to avoid the premature call of `_abort`. We should also check for the presence of `self.stream` before trying to close it in the `_abort` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class WebSocketProtocol13(WebSocketProtocol):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def accept_connection(self):
        try:
            self._handle_websocket_headers()
        except ValueError:
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
            return

        self._accept_connection()
```
