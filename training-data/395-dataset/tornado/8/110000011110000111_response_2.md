The error occurs when the test function `test_missing_websocket_key` is executed. The test sends a request to the server without the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header, but the server responds with a status code of 500 instead of the expected 400. This discrepancy indicates that there is an issue with the server's handling of missing WebSocket headers.

The potential error location within the `accept_connection` method is likely around the `self._handle_websocket_headers()` call. When the required WebSocket headers are missing, the method should properly handle this scenario and return an appropriate status code. This is where the bug is likely occurring.

The reason behind the bug is that the `accept_connection` method is not handling the absence of required WebSocket headers correctly. Instead of returning a 400 status code as expected, it is raising a ValueError, which is not being caught properly. This leads to an AttributeError due to the mishandling of the error condition.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` method should be modified to handle the scenario of missing WebSocket headers by returning a 400 status code instead of raising a ValueError. Additionally, the method should handle potential NoneType errors when accessing attributes such as `self.stream`.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self.write_error(400)  # Return a 400 status code
        self.finish()  # Finish the request
        return
```

With these modifications, the `accept_connection` method will properly handle the scenario of missing WebSocket headers and return the correct status code. Additionally, potential NoneType errors should be handled to avoid AttributeError.
