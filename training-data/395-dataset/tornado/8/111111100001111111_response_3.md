The error occurs in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. When the required headers are missing from the client's request, the `accept_connection` method raises a `ValueError` with the message "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers." This error is caught, and the `_abort` method is called, which in turn tries to close `self.stream`, leading to an `AttributeError` because `self.stream` is `None`.

The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` method tries to handle the handshake process before the handshake has actually occurred, leading to a premature call to `_abort` and subsequent errors.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` method should simply return when the required headers are missing, without trying to proceed with the handshake.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method in the `WebSocketProtocol13` class:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        return
```

With this change, the method will catch the `ValueError` for missing headers but will not call `_abort` and will simply return, preventing the premature attempt to handle the handshake process.
