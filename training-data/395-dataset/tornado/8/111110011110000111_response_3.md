The test case named `test_missing_websocket_key` sends a request without the required `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header to the server. The error message indicates that the server responds with a status code of 500 instead of the expected 400. This indicates that the server is not handling the missing header error correctly.

Looking at the error message and the provided code, the potential error location within the `accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class is when the server tries to handle the case of a missing WebSocket header.

The reason behind the bug is that the `accept_connection` function catches the `ValueError` exception, logs it, then calls `_abort()` and returns without modifying the response code. This results in the server responding with a status code of 500 for a missing header, instead of the expected 400.

To fix this bug, the `accept_connection` function should catch the `ValueError` exception, log it, then set the response code to 400 and return.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self.set_code(400)  # Setting the response code to 400
        self._abort()
        return
```
