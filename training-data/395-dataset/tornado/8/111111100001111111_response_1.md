The bug occurs when the `accept_connection()` function is called if the client misses the required header for the WebSocket handshake. In the provided test case, the bug occurs when the `_handle_websocket_headers()` function raises a `ValueError` due to missing or invalid WebSocket headers. This error is caught by the `accept_connection()` function, which then calls the `_abort()` function and attempts to return. However, before it can return, it raises an `AttributeError` because it tries to execute `self.stream.close()` while `self.stream` is `None`, causing the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'` error.

To fix this bug, the `accept_connection()` function needs to be modified to handle the case where `self.stream` is `None` and perform the necessary error handling or cleanup.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `accept_connection()` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        if self.stream:
            self._abort()
        return
```

In the corrected code, we check if `self.stream` exists before attempting to call `self._abort()`. If `self.stream` is `None`, then the `_abort()` function is not called, avoiding the `AttributeError`. This fix ensures that the `accept_connection()` function handles the case where `self.stream` is `None` and prevents the error from occurring.
