The bug occurs when the WebSocket client misses the required header for the handshake. When this happens, the server raises an AttributeError. This occurs because the `accept_connection` method in the `WebSocketProtocol13` class calls the `_abort` method, which then tries to access `self.stream.close()`, but `self.stream` is `None` at this point.

The reason behind this bug is that the `_abort` method is being called before the handshake, when the `self.stream` is not initialized yet.

To fix this bug, the `accept_connection` method needs to be modified to handle the case when `self._handle_websocket_headers()` raises a `ValueError`, indicating missing or invalid WebSocket headers. In this case, the `_abort` method should not be called, as it is not needed before the handshake.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
```

By removing the call to `self._abort()` in the `accept_connection` method, we ensure that the incorrect attempt to close a non-existent `self.stream` is no longer made before the handshake, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.
