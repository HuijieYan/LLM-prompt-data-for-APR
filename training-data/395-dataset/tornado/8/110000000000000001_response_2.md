The potential error in the provided function 'accept_connection' is that it is catching the 'ValueError' exception but it is not handling it properly. This means that even if a 'ValueError' occurs, the function will continue to execute instead of properly handling the exception.

To fix this issue, the function should handle the 'ValueError' exception and then handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the 'accept_connection' function:

```python
# Corrected function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
```
