The bug in the function `accept_connection` is that it does not handle the ValueError exception properly. The function tries to execute `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection`, but if a ValueError is raised, it logs an error message and then continues to execute the rest of the code, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the ValueError exception properly and prevent the code from continuing execution after logging the error message.

Here is the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        # Additional code to handle the error, such as returning or raising an exception
        return
```
