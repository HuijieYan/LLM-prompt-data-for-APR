The test case "test_missing_websocket_key" is trying to fetch a resource with incomplete headers. The expected response code is 400, but currently, it is receiving a response with code 500.

Looking at the provided function "accept_connection" and the error message, it seems that the buggy function is not handling the incomplete headers properly. Instead of returning a 400 response code, it is returning a 500 response code due to a ValueError being raised.

The bug occurs because the function is not catching the specific ValueError that should be raised when the headers are incomplete. As a result, it goes into the general catch block, triggering the 500 response code.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the specific case of incomplete headers by catching the ValueError and returning a 400 response code.

Here is the corrected code for the "accept_connection" function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        self.handler.send_error(400)
        return
```

With this corrected code, the function will catch the ValueError for incomplete headers and return a 400 response code as expected.
