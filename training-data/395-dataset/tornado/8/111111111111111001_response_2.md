The error message indicates that the test case is expecting a response code of 400, but it's getting a response code of 500. This indicates that the buggy function `accept_connection` is not handling the missing WebSocket headers correctly, leading to an incorrect response code.

The potential error in the `accept_connection` function is the block of code where it catches a `ValueError` exception and returns without handling the error properly. This results in a response code of 500 instead of the expected 400 when certain WebSocket headers are missing.

The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` function doesn't handle the case where WebSocket headers are missing or invalid. It catches a `ValueError`, logs a message, and returns without modifying the response code.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` function should handle the case of missing or invalid WebSocket headers by sending a 400 response code when appropriate.

Here's the corrected `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        log_msg = 'Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers'
        gen_log.debug(log_msg, exc_info=True)
        self.stream.set_close_frame(status_code=1002, reason=log_msg)
        self.stream.close()
        return
```

In the corrected code, we set a close frame with a status code of 1002 (protocol error) and the reason being the log message when missing or invalid WebSocket headers are encountered. Then we close the stream, ensuring that a 400 response code is returned when WebSocket headers are missing or invalid.
