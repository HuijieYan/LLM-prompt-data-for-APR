The error occurs in the `accept_connection` function of the websocket library. When the client misses a required header for the websocket handshake, the server raises an AttributeError. The error occurs because the `accept_connection` function calls the `_abort` function, which in turn tries to access `self.stream.close()`, but `self.stream` is None at this point, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the `accept_connection` function should be updated to handle the case where `self.stream` is None before calling `_abort`. Additionally, the `_abort` function should also be updated to check for the nullity of `self.stream` before attempting to close it.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        if self.stream is not None:
            self._abort()
        return
```

And the corrected code for the `_abort` function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _abort(self):
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
```
