1. Analyze the test case and its relationship with the error message
The test case `test_missing_websocket_key` is sending a request to '/echo' with the required headers for a WebSocket handshake, but it is expecting a response code of 400. However, it is receiving a response code of 500 instead, indicating that an error occurred on the server side.

2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function
The error is likely occurring within the `accept_connection` method of the WebSocketHandler.

3. Explain the reasons behind the occurrence of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the `_abort` method being called before the handshake occurs, leading to an AttributeError when trying to close the `self.stream` object, which may not yet exist at that point in the process.

4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check for the existence of `self.stream` before attempting to close it in the `_abort` method. Additionally, the error handling in the `accept_connection` method can be improved to handle missing or malformed WebSocket headers more effectively.

5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function
```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort(e)

def _abort(self, error):
    gen_log.debug("Aborting WebSocket connection", exc_info=True)
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()

    # Other error handling and cleanup code as needed
```
