The error occurs in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. When the required WebSocket headers are missing, the method raises a `ValueError`, and then immediately calls the `_abort` method, which in turn tries to access `self.stream` without checking if it is `None`, leading to an `AttributeError`. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the `accept_connection` method to validate the WebSocket headers and handle the case where they are missing appropriately. We also need to ensure that `_abort` does not raise an `AttributeError` when accessing `self.stream`.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        if not self.stream:
            raise ValueError("Stream closed before handshake completed")
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s", e)
        self._abort()

def _abort(self):
    if self.stream:
        self.stream.close()
    else:
        # Handle the case where self.stream is None
        pass
```
