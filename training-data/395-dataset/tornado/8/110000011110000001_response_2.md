The potential error in the function `accept_connection` is that it catches a `ValueError` exception but the error in the test function is an `AssertionError` with code 500 when it should be 400. This suggests that the function is not handling the error properly when it should be returning a 400 error code.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly handling the error and returning the correct response code.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the error within the `accept_connection` function and return the appropriate response code. We can modify the function to handle the error and return a 400 response code if there is an issue with the WebSocket request.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self.set_status(400)
        self.finish()
```

With this correction, the `accept_connection` function will properly handle the error and return a 400 response code.
