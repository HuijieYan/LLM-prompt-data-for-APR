The potential error in the provided code is that the `accept_connection` method calls `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` without defining them within the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. 

This results in a NameError because the function `accept_connection` calls functions that are not defined within the `WebSocketProtocol13` class.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions within the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. Additionally, we need to update the try/except block to catch the specific exception that is being raised when the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions are called.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers_13()
        self._accept_connection_13()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

And the updated class definition:

```python
class WebSocketProtocol13(WebSocketProtocol):
    """
    Implementation of the WebSocket protocol from RFC 6455.
    
    This class supports versions 7 and 8 of the protocol in addition to the
    final version 13.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def _handle_websocket_headers_13(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _accept_connection_13(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

By defining the `_handle_websocket_headers_13` and `_accept_connection_13` functions and updating the try/except block to catch the ValueError, we fix the bug and ensure that the `accept_connection` method works as intended within the `WebSocketProtocol13` class.
