The test case `test_missing_websocket_key` is sending a request to a WebSocket endpoint without the required `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header. This test case expects a response with status code 400, but it is receiving a 500 status code instead. This indicates that there is an issue in the server's handling of the missing header.

The bug is likely to be in the `accept_connection` method of the WebSocket server. When the required headers are missing, it raises a `ValueError` and calls the `_abort` method. However, it is not handling the exception properly, leading to an `AttributeError`. The `_abort` method attempts to access `self.stream` without checking whether it's a valid object, leading to the AttributeError.

The bug occurs because the server tries to close a nonexistent `self.stream` object when the required headers are missing. One possible approach to fixing this bug is to check if `self.stream` exists before trying to access it within the `_abort` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        if self.stream:
            self._abort()
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if `self.stream` exists before calling the `_abort` method. This prevents the AttributeError that was occurring when trying to access `self.stream` when it was `None`.
