The error message indicates that the response code was expected to be 400, but it was actually 500. This points to the fact that the `accept_connection` method is not handling the WebSocket connection properly, leading to a 500 response code instead of the expected 400.

The potential error location within the `accept_connection` method is in the `except ValueError` block. The method is catching a `ValueError` exception, but it should be catching a different exception related to handling WebSocket connections.

The bug is occurring because the `accept_connection` method is not properly handling WebSocket connections, leading to an unexpected response code.

To fix the bug, we need to catch the appropriate exception related to WebSocket connection handling, and then handle it accordingly. Additionally, we may need to ensure that the WebSocket headers are properly handled and the connection is accepted as expected.

The corrected code for the `accept_connection` method is as follows:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except WebSocketConnectionError as e:  # assuming WebSocketConnectionError is the appropriate exception
        gen_log.debug("Error in WebSocket connection: %s" % e, exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

In the corrected code, we are catching a `WebSocketConnectionError` exception (replace this with the actual exception name if different) and handling it appropriately. This should address the issue and ensure that the WebSocket connections are handled correctly.
