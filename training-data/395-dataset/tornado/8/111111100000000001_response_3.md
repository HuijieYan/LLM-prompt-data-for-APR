Potential error location: The code is catching a `ValueError` exception, but it is not clear what could potentially raise a `ValueError` within the `accept_connection` function. 

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. It is not clear why a `ValueError` is being caught, as there is no obvious input that could potentially cause this exception.
2. The `gen_log.debug` call should not be included in the except block unless `gen_log` is defined within the function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary `try/except` block and catch the specific exceptions that may occur during the execution of `_handle_websocket_headers()` and `_accept_connection()` functions.
2. If necessary, log any exceptions using the appropriate logger (in this case, `self.log`). 

Corrected code:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    self._handle_websocket_headers()
    self._accept_connection()
```
