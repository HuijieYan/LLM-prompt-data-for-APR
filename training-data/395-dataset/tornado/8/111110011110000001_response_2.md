The error message suggests that the test case is expecting a response code of 400 but is receiving a response code of 500 instead. This indicates that the bug might be in the implementation of the WebSocketProtocol13.accept_connection() method.

Upon inspecting the accept_connection() method, it can be seen that it catches a ValueError but does not re-raise it or log it properly. This means that if there is an error within the _handle_websocket_headers() or _accept_connection() methods, it will be caught and ignored, leading to a successful response being sent back with a status code of 500.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the caught exception properly, perhaps by logging the error and then either re-raising the exception or returning a specific status code (e.g., 400) to indicate to the test case that there was an error.

Here's the corrected code for the accept_connection() method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        raise e  # re-raise the caught exception
```

By re-raising the caught exception, the error will be properly logged, and the response code will be set to 500, matching the behavior that caused the original test case to fail.
