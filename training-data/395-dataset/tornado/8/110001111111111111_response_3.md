The error is occurring in the `accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. This function is calling the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions, and catching any `ValueError` exceptions. However, it seems to be mishandling the exception by calling `_abort()` even though the exception is actually being raised by `_handle_websocket_headers()`.

The reason for the bug is that the `accept_connection` function is not properly handling the exception raised by `_handle_websocket_headers`. Instead of catching a `ValueError`, it is catching any `ValueError` exception regardless of where it is raised. This results in the wrong behavior when a `ValueError` is raised by `_handle_websocket_headers`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `accept_connection` function to only catch exceptions specifically raised by `_handle_websocket_headers`. This ensures that the correct exception handling and cleanup can be performed.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        if str(e) == "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers":
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
            return
        else:
            raise  # re-raise the exception for other cases
```

By modifying the exception handling to only catch specific `ValueError` raised by `_handle_websocket_headers`, we ensure that the correct behavior is maintained and the exception from other parts of the code is propagated correctly.
