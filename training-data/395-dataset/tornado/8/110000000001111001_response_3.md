Potential Error Location:
The error in the provided function seems to be in the handling of the exception. The function is not properly handling the ValueError exception and is returning without executing the required tasks.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is catching a ValueError exception, but it is not logging the specific error message or handling the exception properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle the ValueError exception by logging the specific error message and then aborting the operation.
2. Ensure that the required tasks are executed before returning from the function, even if an exception occurs.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: {}".format(str(e)),
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
