The error occurs when the server receives a WebSocket handshake request with missing or invalid headers. The server raises a ValueError with the message "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers". In the provided buggy function `accept_connection`, there is a try-except block that catches a ValueError and logs the error with debug information before aborting the connection. However, the `accept_connection` method doesn't handle the actual ValueError when it is raised due to missing or invalid headers.

The potential error location is within the try-except block, specifically in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `accept_connection` method is not properly handling the ValueError raised when there are missing or invalid WebSocket headers in the request.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` method should catch the ValueError raised by missing or invalid headers and handle it accordingly. Additionally, the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` methods, which are not provided in the provided code snippets, should also handle the missing or invalid headers by raising a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

In the corrected code, the ValueError raised by `self._handle_websocket_headers()` or `self._accept_connection()` is properly caught and logged with debug information before aborting the connection.
