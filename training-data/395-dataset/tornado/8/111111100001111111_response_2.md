The error occurs in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. When the `self._handle_websocket_headers()` method raises a `ValueError` due to missing or invalid WebSocket headers, the `self._abort()` method is called. However, the `self._abort()` method contains the line `self.stream.close()`, which tries to close the WebSocket stream without checking if it is `None` or not.

To fix this issue, the `self._abort()` method should check if `self.stream` is `None` before trying to close it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _abort(self):
    if self.stream is not None:  # Add this check
        self.stream.close()
    # ... other code ...

# class declaration containing the correct function
class WebSocketProtocol13(WebSocketProtocol):
    # ... other code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def accept_connection(self):
        try:
            self._handle_websocket_headers()
            self._accept_connection()
        except ValueError:
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                          exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
            return
```

With this fix, the `accept_connection` method will first check if `self.stream` is not `None` before trying to close it in the `self._abort()` method, preventing the AttributeError from occurring.
