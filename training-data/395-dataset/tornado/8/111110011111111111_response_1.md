The error seems to occur when the server receives a WebSocket handshake request from the client without the required headers. This causes the `ValueError` to be raised in the `_handle_websocket_headers` function, triggering the `except` block in the `accept_connection` method.

The problem here is that the `ValueError` exception is being caught in the `accept_connection` method, but the code in the `except` block is not handling the exception correctly. It attempts to call `gen_log.debug`, which is not defined in the given code, and then immediately calls `_abort` without checking for the existence of `self.stream`.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `accept_connection` method to properly handle the `ValueError` exception and check for the existence of `self.stream` before calling methods on it.

Here is the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        log_msg = 'Malformed WebSocket request received: {}'.format(str(e))
        gen_log.error(log_msg, exc_info=True)
        self._abort()

        # Additionally, if self.stream is not None, close it
        if self.stream:
            self.stream.close()
```

In this corrected code, we properly handle the `ValueError` exception, log the error using `gen_log.error`, and then call `_abort`. We also added a check to ensure that `self.stream` exists before calling `close` on it.
