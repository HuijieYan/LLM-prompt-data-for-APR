The issue occurs because the `_abort` function is called before the handshake, and there is no `self.stream` defined yet. Consequently, calling `self.stream.close()` in the `_abort` function results in an `AttributeError` because `self.stream` is `None`.

To fix this issue, the `accept_connection` function needs to be modified to ensure that `self.stream` is not `None` before calling the `_abort` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        if self.stream is not None:
            self._abort()
        return
```

By adding the check `if self.stream is not None` before calling the `_abort` function, we ensure that the code won't try to close a `NoneType` object and avoid the `AttributeError`.
