Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the `accept_connection` function where it attempts to catch a `ValueError` but the actual exception being raised is not a `ValueError`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `accept_connection` function is catching a `ValueError`, but the exception being raised is not a `ValueError`. This could be due to a different exception being raised in the `_handle_websocket_headers` or `_accept_connection` functions, or potentially another issue within the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Review the code within the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions to ensure they are not raising unexpected exceptions.
2. Update the `accept_connection` function to catch the specific exception that is being raised rather than a general `ValueError`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:  # Catch the specific exception being raised
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % e, exc_info=True)  # Log the specific exception message
        self._abort()
        return
```
