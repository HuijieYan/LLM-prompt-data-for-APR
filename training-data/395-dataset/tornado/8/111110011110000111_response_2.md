The test case "test_missing_websocket_key" is attempting to check if the response code is 400, but it is currently failing with an assertion error as the actual response code is 500.

The bug seems to be located in the "accept_connection" function of the WebSocketProtocol13 class. The accept_connection method calls the _handle_websocket_headers and _accept_connection methods. Inside the accept_connection method, it has a try-except block that catches ValueError, but it doesn't handle the scenario where a header is missing from the WebSocket request.

The bug occurs because when the _handle_websocket_headers method encounters a missing header, it raises a ValueError. This causes the try-except block in the accept_connection method to catch the ValueError and return without setting an appropriate HTTP response code, leading to a 500 Internal Server Error instead of the expected 400 Bad Request.

To fix this issue, we should handle the scenario where a header is missing from the WebSocket request and set the appropriate HTTP response code. This can be achieved by checking the specific error scenario in the except block and setting the response code accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WebSocketProtocol13(WebSocketProtocol):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # corrected accept_connection function
    def accept_connection(self):
        try:
            self._handle_websocket_headers()
            self._accept_connection()
        except ValueError as e:
            if "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers" in str(e):
                self.set_400_bad_request_response()
            else:
                gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                              exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
            return
```

In the corrected code, we add a check in the except block to specifically handle the "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers" error and set the response code to 400 by calling a helper method `set_400_bad_request_response()`. This helper method will set the appropriate HTTP response code for the case where a required header is missing from the WebSocket request.
