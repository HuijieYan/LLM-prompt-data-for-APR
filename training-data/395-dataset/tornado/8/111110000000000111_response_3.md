The error occurs when the WebSocket client misses the required header for the WebSocket handshake. This results in a ValueError being raised with the message "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers".

The bug is within the accept_connection function in the WebSocketProtocol13 class. This function immediately calls the _handle_websocket_headers function and _accept_connection function without checking for the existence of the required headers. If the headers are missing, it raises a ValueError and calls the _abort function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the accept_connection function to properly handle the case when the required headers are missing. This can be done by adding a check for the existence of the required headers before calling the _handle_websocket_headers and _accept_connection functions.

Here's the correct implementation of the accept_connection function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        # Check for the presence of the required headers
        if not all(header in self.request.headers for header in ['Upgrade', 'Connection', 'Sec-WebSocket-Version']):
            # If any of the required headers is missing, raise a ValueError
            raise ValueError("Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers")

        # If the required headers are present, proceed with handling the connection
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

With this modification, the accept_connection function now checks for the presence of the required headers before proceeding with the WebSocket handshake. If any of the required headers is missing, it will raise a ValueError as before and handle the connection accordingly.
