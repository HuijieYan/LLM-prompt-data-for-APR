Potential error location: The accept_connection function is catching a ValueError exception, but it is not properly handling it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The accept_connection function is not handling the ValueError exception correctly, leading to a potential error in the code execution.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The accept_connection function should handle the ValueError exception appropriately, such as logging the error and returning a proper response.

Corrected code for the accept_connection function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % e, exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
