The potential error in the provided function is that it catches a ValueError exception but does not handle it properly. The function should handle the ValueError exception when it occurs.

The error message "Malformed WebSocket request received" suggests that the function expects proper WebSocket headers, but they are missing or invalid.

To fix the bug, the function should catch the ValueError exception and handle it by logging the error message and aborting the connection.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort('Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers')
        return
```
In the corrected code, the function now catches the ValueError exception, logs the error message, and then aborts the connection with the appropriate error message.
