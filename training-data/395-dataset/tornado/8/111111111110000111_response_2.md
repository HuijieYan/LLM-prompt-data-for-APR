The error occurs when the `accept_connection` method is called in the WebSocketProtocol13 class. The method tries to handle websocket headers and accept the connection, but if it encounters a ValueError, it logs an error, aborts, and returns. However, the ValueError is not properly handled, leading to an AttributeError in the case of missing or invalid WebSocket headers.

The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` method is not properly handling the ValueError and as a result, it is causing the AttributeError when trying to call `self._abort()`.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` method should catch the ValueError and handle it properly. It should also include proper error handling and logging for the cases where required headers are missing or invalid.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

With this fix, the `accept_connection` method will catch any ValueError and handle it properly, logging the error and aborting the connection in case of missing or invalid WebSocket headers.
