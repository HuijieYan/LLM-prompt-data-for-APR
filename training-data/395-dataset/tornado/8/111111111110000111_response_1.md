The test case is attempting to check for a 400 response code, but it's receiving a 500 response code instead, leading to an AssertionError.

The error is likely occurring within the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class, specifically in the `except` block. The code catches a `ValueError` exception, logs a debug message, then calls the `_abort` method and returns. However, the issue is that the `_abort` method and possibly the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` methods have been defined as empty methods without any functionality. Therefore, it's likely that nothing meaningful is being done in these methods, which could be the root cause of the error.

The bug occurs because the server is trying to handle a WebSocket connection without proper error handling and validation of the WebSocket headers.

To fix the bug, we should handle the WebSocket headers properly and also add proper error handling to respond with the correct HTTP status code. If the WebSocket headers are missing or invalid, it should return a 400 Bad Request HTTP status code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WebSocketProtocol13(WebSocketProtocol):

    # ... omitted code ...

    def accept_connection(self):
        try:
            if not self.stream:
                raise ValueError("No stream available for WebSocket connection")
            self._handle_websocket_headers()
            self._accept_connection()
        except ValueError as e:
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
            self.stream.write(tornado.escape.utf8(
                "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n"
            ))
            self.stream.close()
```

In the corrected version, we check if `self.stream` is available before trying to proceed with handling the WebSocket connection. If the headers are missing or invalid, we respond with a 400 Bad Request HTTP status code and close the stream to maintain proper error handling.
