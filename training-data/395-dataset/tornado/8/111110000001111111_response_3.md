The bug occurs in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. It calls the `_handle_websocket_headers` method, which can raise a `ValueError` if there are missing or invalid WebSocket headers. If this error occurs, the `_abort` method is called immediately, which can lead to an `AttributeError` when trying to access `self.stream` since the WebSocket handshake has not been completed yet.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the WebSocket handshake is successfully completed before calling methods that rely on the handshake being finished. One approach is to modify the `accept_connection` method to handle any `ValueError` raised by `_handle_websocket_headers` and only proceed if the handshake was successful. If the headers are missing or invalid, the error should be logged, and the connection should be aborted gracefully without attempting to access `self.stream`.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
```

With this change, the `accept_connection` method now handles the `ValueError` raised by `_handle_websocket_headers` and gracefully aborts the connection without attempting to access `self.stream` before it's available.
