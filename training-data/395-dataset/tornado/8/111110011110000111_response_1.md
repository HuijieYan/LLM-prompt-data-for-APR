The test case `test_missing_websocket_key` is trying to simulate a situation where a websocket handshake is initiated without the required `Sec-WebSocket-Key` header. The error message shows that the assertion of `response.code` is failing, indicating that the server response code is 500 instead of the expected 400.

The potential error location within the `accept_connection` function is the try-except block. If `_handle_websocket_headers` or `_accept_connection` raises a `ValueError` exception, the current implementation catches it and logs a message using `gen_log.debug`, but it does not return a response code of 400 and hence prevents the test from passing.

The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` function is not handling the `ValueError` exceptions correctly, and it is also missing the logic to return a response code of 400 as expected.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` function should be modified to catch the `ValueError` exceptions and return a response code of 400. Additionally, the logging can be improved to provide more informative messages.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WebSocketProtocol13(WebSocketProtocol):
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # this is the corrected function
    def accept_connection(self):
        try:
            self._handle_websocket_headers()
            self._accept_connection()
        except ValueError:
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
            self.stream.write(b"HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n")
            self.stream.close()
```

In the corrected code, when a `ValueError` is caught, the function logs a debug message, aborts the connection, writes a response code of 400 to the stream, and then closes the stream. This should ensure that the test case `test_missing_websocket_key` passes as expected.
