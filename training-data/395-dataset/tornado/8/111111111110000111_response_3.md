The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'" indicates that the code is trying to access the close method on a NoneType object, which means that the connection/stream is not being properly handled.

The bug is likely occurring in the `_abort` method within the `WebSocketProtocol` class, as it is attempting to close the stream without checking if it exists.

The test case "test_missing_websocket_key" is trying to connect to a WebSocket server without providing the "Sec-WebSocket-Key" header, and it expects a 400 code response. However, it is currently receiving a 500 code response due to the error in the server's handling of missing headers.

To fix the bug, the `_abort` method in the `WebSocketProtocol` class should be modified to check if the stream exists before attempting to close it. Additionally, the `accept_connection` method should be modified to handle the exception more gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % e, exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
```

And here's the corrected `_abort` method:

```python
def _abort(self):
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
    # handle other cleanup or error-handling as needed
```
