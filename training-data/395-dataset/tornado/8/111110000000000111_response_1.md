The error occurs because the `_accept_connection` function calls the `_abort` function, which in turn calls `self.stream.close()` without checking the nullity of `self.stream`. This happens before the handshake, so `self.stream` is `None`, hence causing the `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure the `self.stream` is not `None` before calling `self.stream.close()` in the `_abort` function. Additionally, we should also check the nullity of `self.stream` before calling `self.close()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        if self.stream is not None:
            self._abort()
        return
```
Additionally, the corrected code for the `_abort` function is:

```python
def _abort(self):
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
    self.stream = None
    self.close()
```
