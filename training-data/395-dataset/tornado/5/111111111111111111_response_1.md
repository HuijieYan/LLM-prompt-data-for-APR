The error is caused by the incorrect calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class. The method is using the wrong calculation to determine the next timeout, leading to the periodic callback executing too often.

The issue is occurring because the calculation of the next timeout is based on an incorrect assumption about the relationship between `current_time`, `_next_timeout`, and `callback_time_sec`. As a result, the callback is being scheduled with the wrong interval.

To fix the issue, the calculation in the `_update_next` method needs to be adjusted to ensure that the next timeout is correctly calculated based on the `callback_time` and the difference between `current_time` and `_next_timeout`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_passed = current_time - self._next_timeout
            next_calls_missed = math.floor(time_passed / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += (next_calls_missed + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

By making these changes, the `_update_next` method will now correctly calculate the next timeout and ensure that the periodic callback is scheduled at the correct intervals.

This should address the issue and ensure that the periodic callback executes at the expected times, resolving the bug.
