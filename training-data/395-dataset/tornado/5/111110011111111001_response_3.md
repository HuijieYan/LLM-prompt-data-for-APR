The error in the function `_update_next` is caused by the incorrect computation of the next timeout. The function uses a calculation to determine the next timeout, and this seems to be the source of the bug.

The bug occurs because the function uses both integer and float types without proper conversion, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the function `_update_next` should ensure that the intermediate results are in a consistent type. Additionally, it would be better to use floating-point arithmetic throughout the computation to avoid rounding errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:
```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... rest of the class ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
            time_skipped = math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += (time_skipped + 1) * callback_time_sec
```
In the corrected code, all the intermediate variables and calculations are consistent with the proper data type and we use floating-point arithmetic to handle the calculations accurately.
