Potential error location: The buggy line of code is the calculation of self._next_timeout.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy calculation does not accurately update the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to modify the calculation of self._next_timeout to accurately update the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

Corrected code:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        self._next_timeout = current_time + callback_time_sec
```
