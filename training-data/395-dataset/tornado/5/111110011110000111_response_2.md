The error occurs when the test function `test_clock_backwards` is run. The difference in the expected and actual output suggests that the `_update_next` function of the `PeriodicCallback` class is not working as expected. The function is responsible for updating the next timeout value based on the current time.

The potential error in the `PeriodicCallback._update_next` function is in the line:
```python
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) /
                                              callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```
This line attempts to calculate the next timeout value, but it might be incorrect due to improper time calculations.

The bug occurs because the current time and next timeout values are not being calculated properly, resulting in incorrect scheduling of the callbacks.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the next timeout value to ensure that it accurately reflects the next scheduled time for the callback.

The corrected code for the `_update_next` function is as follows:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_since_last_callback = current_time - self._next_timeout
        if time_since_last_callback >= callback_time_sec:
            # Calculate the number of missed intervals and update the next timeout
            missed_intervals = math.floor(time_since_last_callback / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += (missed_intervals + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected function, we first calculate the time since the last callback using `current_time - self._next_timeout`. Then, we check if the time since the last callback is greater than or equal to the callback interval. If it is, we calculate the number of missed intervals and update the next timeout accordingly. This ensures that the callbacks are scheduled accurately.

This correction should fix the bug and ensure that the `PeriodicCallback` executes as expected in the test case.
