The issue is with the `_update_next` function in the `PeriodicCallback` class. The function is supposed to calculate the next timeout based on the current time, but it is not producing the expected results. The issue arises from the usage of floating-point and integer arithmetic, which leads to inaccurate calculations.

To fix this issue, it's important to ensure that the arithmetic operations involving time are performed consistently using the same data type (either all integers or all floats) to avoid inconsistencies due to type conversions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            next_timeout_ms = math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (next_timeout_ms * self.callback_time)
```

In this corrected version, the calculations involving time are consistently using floating-point arithmetic to ensure accurate results. This should resolve the discrepancies observed in the test cases and ensure that the `PeriodicCallback` executes at the correct intervals.
