The error occurs because the function `_update_next` is not calculating the next timeout correctly. It is using integer division and not properly calculating the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

To fix the bug, the function `_update_next` should be updated to correctly calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.ceil(-time_diff / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout += num_intervals * callback_time_sec
```

With this corrected function, the next timeout will be correctly calculated based on the current time and the callback time. This should resolve the issue and make the test case pass as expected.
