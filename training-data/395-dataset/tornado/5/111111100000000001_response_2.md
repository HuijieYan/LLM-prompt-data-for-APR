Potential error location: 
The potential error in the `_update_next` function is the calculation of the next timeout. 

Reasons for the bug:
The bug occurs because the calculation of the next timeout is not accurate due to the way the floor division and addition are being handled.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by using math.ceil instead of math.floor and changing the calculation method to ensure that the next timeout is calculated correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import math

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_5/tornado/ioloop.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class PeriodicCallback(object):
    """
    Schedules the given callback to be called periodically.
    
    The callback is called every ``callback_time`` milliseconds.
    Note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, while most other
    time-related functions in Tornado use seconds.
    
    If the callback runs for longer than ``callback_time`` milliseconds,
    subsequent invocations will be skipped to get back on schedule.
    
    `start` must be called after the `PeriodicCallback` is created.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.
    """

    # this is the fixed function
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
            cycles = math.ceil(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += cycles * callback_time_sec
