The test case `test_clock_backwards` seems to be checking for the behavior of `PeriodicCallback` when the system time jumps backward. The test seems to be asserting that the callback times are scheduled properly even when the system time jumps backward.

The error message indicates that the expected output of the `simulate_calls` function does not match the actual values. The first differing element is at index 1, where the expected value is `1010.0`, but the actual value is `1020`. This indicates that the `simulate_calls` function is not producing the expected results, which could be related to the `_update_next` method.

The potential error in the `_update_next` method seems to be related to the calculation of the next timeout. It appears that the calculation is not taking into account the possibility of the system time jumping backwards, which is causing the scheduled callback times to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `_update_next` method should be modified to consider the case where the system time jumps backward. This can be achieved by using the difference between the current time and the next timeout to adjust the next timeout accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_since_last_timeout = current_time - self._next_timeout
        if time_since_last_timeout < 0:  # Adjust for backward time jump
            self._next_timeout = current_time + callback_time_sec
        else:
            self._next_timeout += (math.floor(time_since_last_timeout / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

In this corrected code, `time_since_last_timeout` is used to check if the system time has jumped backwards, and if so, the next timeout is adjusted accordingly. This should address the issue and ensure that the scheduled callback times are accurate even in the case of backward time jumps.
