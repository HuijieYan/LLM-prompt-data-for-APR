The issue here is that the `_update_next` function in the `PeriodicCallback` class is not updating the `self._next_timeout` value correctly, resulting in the callback being executed more often than expected.

The bug occurs because the existing logic for updating the next timeout does not handle the case where the current time is very close to the next timeout, resulting in the next timeout being calculated incorrectly.

To fix this issue, the `_update_next` function needs to be modified to correctly calculate the next timeout. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (other code) ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            intervals = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += intervals * callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected version:

1. We use `math.ceil` instead of `math.floor` to ensure that the next timeout is calculated correctly even if the current_time is very close to the scheduled time.
2. We calculate the number of intervals by dividing the time difference by the callback time, and then use this to update the next timeout.

With these changes, the function should now correctly update the next timeout and prevent the callback from executing more often than expected.
