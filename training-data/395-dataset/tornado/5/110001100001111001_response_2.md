The issue in the provided function is that it is not calculating the correct next timeout value based on the current time and the callback time. The calculation is intended to ensure that the next timeout is a multiple of the callback time, but the current implementation is not achieving this.

The function is intended to calculate the next timeout value based on the current_time, callback_time, and the previous value of _next_timeout. However, there is an issue with the calculation logic which is leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the math.floor function should be applied to the division result before adding the product to the _next_timeout. Additionally, the variable callback_time_sec should be cast to float to ensure accurate division.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = float(self.callback_time) / 1000.0
        self._next_timeout += math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

With these modifications, the function should correctly calculate the next timeout based on the input parameters.
