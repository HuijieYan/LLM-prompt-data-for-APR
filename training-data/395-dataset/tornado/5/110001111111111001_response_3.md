The function `_update_next` is designed to update the next timeout for the periodic callback. It seems that the function is not correctly updating the `self._next_timeout` value as per the input parameters.

Looking at the test case `test_clock_backwards`, it appears that the function is expected to return a list of timeouts, but it fails for the given input, and the expected output doesn't match the actual output.

The bug in the function is that it's not correctly updating the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

The issue arises from the line:
```python
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

The current implementation incorrectly updates the `self._next_timeout` without considering the difference between `current_time` and `self._next_timeout`.

To fix the bug, the function should calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. It should take into account the difference between `current_time` and `self._next_timeout`.

Here is the corrected implementation of the function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        if time_diff >= callback_time_sec:
            num_callbacks = math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_callbacks + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected version, the function calculates the time difference and updates the next timeout based on the `num_callbacks` and `callback_time_sec`.

This should resolve the issue and make the function update the next timeout correctly.
