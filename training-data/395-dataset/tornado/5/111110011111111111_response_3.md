It seems like the `_update_next` function in the `PeriodicCallback` class is not calculating the next timeout correctly. The function is using `math.floor` to calculate the number of callback_time intervals that have passed, but it's not updating `_next_timeout` correctly.

The issue arises from the fact that `_next_timeout` is initially set as an integer and then updated with floating-point numbers using `callback_time_sec`. This causes discrepancies in the expected and actual values of `_next_timeout` and results in the failed test case.

To fix this issue, we can update the `_next_timeout` to be a floating-point value from the start, and then perform calculations using floating-point numbers to maintain consistency. Additionally, we should handle the case where the callback runs for longer than `callback_time` milliseconds to handle subsequent invocations correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            intervals_passed = (current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec
            if intervals_passed > 1:
                self._next_timeout = current_time + callback_time_sec
            else:
                self._next_timeout += callback_time_sec
```

By making these changes, the function should now calculate the next timeout more accurately and resolve the discrepancy between the expected and actual values. The corrected code should now pass the provided test cases.

This change will ensure that the callback execution time is handled correctly, adjusting the next timeout based on the actual running time of the callback.
