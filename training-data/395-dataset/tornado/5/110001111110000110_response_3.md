# Corrected function source code
```python
import math

# this is the corrected function
def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        difference = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_of_callbacks = math.floor(difference / callback_time_sec) + 1
        self._next_timeout += num_of_callbacks * callback_time_sec
```
The corrected function adjust the next timeout by calculating the difference between the current time and the next timeout, and updating the next timeout accordingly based on the callback time.
