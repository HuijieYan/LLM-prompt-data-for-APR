Since the error message is indicating that the `PeriodicCallback` is executing too often specifically on Windows, the issue might be related to the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` function.

Analyzing the `_update_next` function, it seems that there might be an issue with how the next timeout is being calculated. The calculation of `self._next_timeout` seems to be incorrect, which can result in the callback executing too often.

The issue may be related to the formula being used to calculate the next timeout. It appears that the formula is not accurately accounting for the duration of the callback. This could cause the next timeout to be calculated incorrectly, leading to the PeriodicCallback executing too frequently.

To fix this bug, the formula for calculating the next timeout should be updated to accurately account for the callback duration.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
            num_intervals = math.ceil(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += num_intervals * callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected code, the `math.floor` function has been replaced with `math.ceil` to accurately calculate the number of intervals that have passed. This should help ensure that the next timeout is calculated correctly and prevent the callback from executing too frequently.
