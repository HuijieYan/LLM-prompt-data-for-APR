The error message shows an AssertionError on comparing two lists, where one list contains float values and the other contains integer values. This suggests that the _update_next function in the PeriodicCallback class is not updating the _next_timeout value correctly, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual output.

The potential error location is in the calculation of the next timeout within the _update_next method.

The bug occurs because the calculation for the next timeout is not updating the _next_timeout value correctly, leading to incorrect scheduling of the callback.

To fix the bug, the _update_next method should be modified to correctly calculate and update the _next_timeout value. Additionally, it should handle the situation where the callback time is longer than the time elapsed, and adjust the scheduling accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the _update_next method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (other methods)

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
            intervals = math.ceil(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += max(intervals, 1) * callback_time_sec
```

This updated method accurately calculates the elapsed time, determines the number of intervals, and updates the _next_timeout value accordingly. This should address the issue and ensure that the callback scheduling works correctly.
