Potential error location: The calculation of the next timeout using callback_time_sec and current_time.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the calculation of the next timeout is not correctly adjusting for the current time.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the absolute value of the difference between current_time and self._next_timeout to always have a positive value for the division and calculation.
2. Use the modulus operator to calculate the remainder and add it to the _next_timeout value.

Corrected code:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback:
    def __init__(self):
        self.callback_time = 10000
        self._next_timeout = 1000

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
            self._next_timeout += ((math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec) % callback_time_sec
```
