Potential error location: The error may occur in the calculation of `self._next_timeout`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may occur because the calculation of `self._next_timeout` does not account for the case where `current_time` is greater than `self._next_timeout`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the calculation of `self._next_timeout` to handle the case where `current_time` is greater than `self._next_timeout`.
2. Consider using the modulus operator to calculate the next timeout more accurately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    """
    Schedules the given callback to be called periodically.
    
    The callback is called every ``callback_time`` milliseconds.
    Note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, while most other
    time-related functions in Tornado use seconds.
    
    If the callback runs for longer than ``callback_time`` milliseconds,
    subsequent invocations will be skipped to get back on schedule.
    
    `start` must be called after the `PeriodicCallback` is created.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.
    """

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            num_intervals = math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_intervals * self.callback_time)
