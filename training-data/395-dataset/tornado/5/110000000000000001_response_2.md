Potential error location: 
The potential error is within the calculation of the new `_next_timeout` value. The formula currently used to calculate the new timeout may not be accurately updating the next timeout based on the current time and callback time.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The current formula appears to be incorrect as it does not accurately calculate the new `_next_timeout` value based on the current time and callback time. This could lead to incorrect scheduling of the next timeout.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the current time and callback time to accurately calculate the new `_next_timeout` value.
2. Utilize the proper formula for calculating the next timeout based on the current time and callback time.

Corrected code:
```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.ceil(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_intervals * callback_time_sec)
```
