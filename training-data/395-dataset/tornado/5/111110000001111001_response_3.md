Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The current implementation does not handle the case where the current time is less than the next timeout. This can lead to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect scheduling of the next callback.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure that the next timeout calculation is correct and handles the case where the current time is less than the next timeout.

Corrected code:
```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            intervals = (current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec
            if intervals < 0:
                intervals = 0
            self._next_timeout += math.ceil(intervals) * callback_time_sec
```
