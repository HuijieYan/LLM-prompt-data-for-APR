The issue appears to stem from the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class in the `ioloop.py` file. The calculation of the next timeout seems to be incorrect, resulting in the periodic callback being executed too often, as indicated by the error message from the test function.

Upon analysis of the buggy function, it seems that the issue arises from the way the new `_next_timeout` is calculated. The calculation is based on the current time and the `callback_time` in seconds, and then adjusting the `_next_timeout` to be a multiple of `callback_time` after the current time.

The bug is caused by inaccuracies in the calculation due to the use of floating-point arithmetic for time-related calculations. This can lead to rounding errors and inaccuracies, causing the periodic callbacks to be triggered at incorrect times.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the time calculations are performed accurately in order to schedule the next callback correctly. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use integer arithmetic for time calculations inside the `_update_next` method to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

Here is the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback:
    # Other methods and attributes

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_seconds = self.callback_time // 1000  # Convert to seconds
            time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
            intervals = math.floor(time_diff / callback_seconds) + 1
            self._next_timeout += intervals * self.callback_time
```

By performing integer division and using integer arithmetic for time calculations, the above corrected code should mitigate the inaccuracies caused by floating-point arithmetic and ensure that the next timeout is calculated accurately.
