The bug in the provided function is related to the calculation of the next timeout. It seems that the function is not updating the next timeout accurately based on the provided input parameters.

The calculation of the next timeout is dependent on the current time, the callback time, and the previous next timeout value. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of the next timeout.

To fix this bug, the logic for updating the next timeout needs to be revised to ensure it accurately calculates the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_since_last = current_time - self._next_timeout
            next_timeout_count = math.ceil(time_since_last / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (next_timeout_count * callback_time_sec)
```

In the corrected code, the next timeout is updated based on the time since the last timeout and the callback time. This should fix the bug and ensure that the next timeout is calculated accurately.
