The bug occurs in the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class. The function is intended to update the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. However, there is an issue with the calculation that causes the expected and actual results to differ.

The issue arises from updating the `_next_timeout` using the formula:

```
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

This formula results in a constant value, `callback_time_sec`, being repeatedly added to `_next_timeout`, leading to the incorrect next timeout values.

To fix this bug, we should calculate the number of callback intervals that have passed between the current time and the previous `_next_timeout`, and then update the `_next_timeout` based on the number of intervals.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        intervals_passed = math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / (self.callback_time / 1000.0))
        self._next_timeout += (intervals_passed + 1) * (self.callback_time / 1000.0)
```

In this corrected code, we calculate the `intervals_passed` by dividing the elapsed time by the callback time. Then we update the `_next_timeout` by adding the product of the number of intervals and the callback time. This ensures that the next timeout is correctly updated based on the actual time intervals that have passed.
