The problem is occurring in the `_update_next` function of the `PeriodicCallback` class. The function is supposed to update the next timeout based on the current time. However, it seems that the calculation for updating the next timeout is not working correctly based on the error message from the test function.

The buggy part of the code can be identified as the calculation of the `_next_timeout` value where the callback time is involved. The issue seems to be related to the use of integer division and conversion between integer and float types.

The function should be updated to ensure that the time calculation and updating of `_next_timeout` are done correctly using floating-point arithmetic.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0  # Convert callback time to seconds
            time_passed = current_time - self._next_timeout  # Calculate time passed since last timeout
            num_callbacks_missed = math.floor(time_passed / callback_time_sec)  # Number of missed callbacks
            new_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_callbacks_missed + 1) * callback_time_sec  # Calculate new timeout
            self._next_timeout = new_timeout
```

In this corrected code, the time-related calculations are performed using floating-point arithmetic to avoid integer division and type conversion issues. This should address the problem observed in the test function.
