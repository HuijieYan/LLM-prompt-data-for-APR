The test case `test_clock_backwards` is comparing the expected output with the actual output of the `simulate_calls` function. The test fails because the expected output is `[1010, 1020, 1030, 1040, 1050]` but the actual output is `[1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0]`. This suggests that the function `_update_next` is not updating the timeouts correctly, resulting in the incorrect output.

The potential error location within the `_update_next` function is in the calculation of the next timeout. The function is supposed to calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time, but it seems to be missing some logic or incorrectly updating the `self._next_timeout`.

The bug is occurring because the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` function does not consider negative time differences when `self._next_timeout` is less than or equal to `current_time`. This causes the subsequent `simulate_calls` function to produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` function to properly handle negative time differences and adjust the next timeout accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_5/tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected function
def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        if time_diff < 0:
            self._next_timeout = current_time + callback_time_sec
        else:
            self._next_timeout += (math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

This corrected code should handle negative time differences and adjust the next timeout accordingly, resulting in the correct behavior of the `simulate_calls` function.
