The error message shows that the expected output is [1010, 1020, 1030, 1040, 1050], but the actual output is [1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0]. This suggests that the floating-point numbers are not being converted to integers properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that calculates the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. Here's the problematic line:

```python
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

The bug is occurring because the result of this calculation needs to be converted from a floating-point number to an integer. The current implementation results in floating-point numbers.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use the `int()` function to convert the result to an integer. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            self._next_timeout += int((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec + 1) * callback_time_sec
```
