The buggy function `_update_next` has multiple issues. Firstly, it doesn't handle the case when `self._next_timeout` is greater than `current_time`, which can lead to continuous incrementing of `_next_timeout` causing the callback to execute too often. Secondly, there's no import statement for the `math` module which is used in the function.

The `math` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file to resolve the first issue. Then, the `if` condition should be updated to check if the `_next_timeout` is greater than the `current_time`, and if so, it should be updated using the `max()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        self._next_timeout = max(self._next_timeout, current_time) + math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec
```

The changes ensure that `_next_timeout` is updated correctly based on the difference between the current time and the previous `_next_timeout` value.
