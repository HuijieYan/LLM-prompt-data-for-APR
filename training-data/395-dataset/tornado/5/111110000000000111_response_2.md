The error message states that the PeriodicCallback executes too often on Windows. Looking at the code and logs, it seems that the _update_next function is not updating the next timeout correctly.

The potential error location is within the _update_next function. The calculation of the next timeout seems to be incorrect, causing subsequent invocations to happen more frequently than they should.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the next timeout does not take into account the current time properly, leading to subsequent invocations happening too soon.

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculation of the next timeout to consider the current time and the callback time correctly to ensure that subsequent invocations happen at the expected intervals.

Here's the corrected code for the _update_next function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... other code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_since_last = current_time - self._next_timeout
            next_invocation_delta = math.ceil(time_since_last / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += next_invocation_delta * callback_time_sec
```

With this correction, the _update_next function now correctly calculates the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time, ensuring that subsequent invocations happen at the expected intervals.
