The buggy function `_update_next` is intended to update the next timeout for a PeriodicCallback object. The function seems to have an issue with the calculation of the next timeout.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly updates the next timeout by adding a fixed amount of time (`callback_time_sec`) to the current time, which results in a constant increment regardless of the actual elapsed time. This leads to the incorrect calculation of the next timeout.

To fix this bug, the function should calculate the difference between the current time and the next timeout, and then adjust the next timeout based on the difference and the callback time.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        additional_periods = max(0, math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec))
        self._next_timeout += additional_periods * callback_time_sec
```

This corrected code ensures that the next timeout is correctly calculated based on the elapsed time and the callback time. It addresses the issue of the next timeout being incremented by a constant value without considering the actual time elapsed. This should resolve the error in the test cases and ensure that the next timeout is correctly updated based on the elapsed time.
