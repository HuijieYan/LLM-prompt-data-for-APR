The test case `test_clock_backwards` for the `PeriodicCallback` class is designed to check the behavior when there are backwards jumps in time. The expected behavior is to ignore the backwards jumps and still call the callback at its scheduled time, potentially resulting in a slightly slow schedule.

The error message indicates that the function `simulate_calls` is returning unexpected values when simulating backwards jumps. The specific assertion error shows that the expected list `[1010, 1020, 1030, 1040, 1050]` does not match the actual list `[1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0]`. This discrepancy in lists suggests that the `_update_next` function that calculates the next timeout is not working as expected, resulting in incorrect values.

The buggy function `_update_next` has an issue where it is dealing with time computations using both integer and floating-point values inconsistently. It takes `callback_time` as an integer value and then does calculations with floating-point values, leading to discrepancies in the results.

To fix the bug, the time computations within the `_update_next` function should be consistent in terms of data types. Specifically, when calculating the next timeout, all time-related variables and values should be handled consistently as either integers or floating-point numbers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            next_timeout_increment = math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1
            self._next_timeout += next_timeout_increment * callback_time_sec
```

In this corrected code, the variable `next_timeout_increment` is calculated as a whole number, and then the calculation for the next timeout uses floating-point arithmetic to ensure accuracy. This approach maintains consistency in data types throughout the time computations, addressing the potential sources of error in the original `update_next` function.
