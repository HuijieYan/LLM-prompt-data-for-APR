The error message in the test function indicates a discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output, specifically for the timings of the calls. This suggests that the `_update_next` function in the `PeriodicCallback` class is not calculating the next timeout correctly, leading to incorrect scheduling of the periodic callback.

The potential error is located in the `_update_next` function where the calculation for `self._next_timeout` may not be accurately determining the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

The bug occurs because the current calculation for `_update_next` does not properly handle negative time differences and does not adjust the scheduling accordingly. This can lead to incorrect scheduling of the periodic callbacks, as observed in the test case.

To fix this bug, the `_update_next` function should be modified to accurately calculate the next timeout taking into account negative time differences and adjusting the scheduling accordingly.

The corrected code for the `_update_next` function is as follows:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (other class code)

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        if time_diff > 0:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            self._next_timeout += (math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
        else:
            self._next_timeout = current_time + (self.callback_time / 1000)
```

In the corrected code, the `_update_next` function has been updated to correctly handle negative time differences by setting the next timeout to the current time plus the callback time if the time difference is negative. Otherwise, it calculates the next timeout based on the existing logic for positive time differences.
