Potential Error:
The error could be in the calculation of the next timeout using the formula provided.

Reason for the Bug:
The calculation for updating the next timeout may not be correct due to the floor division and addition of `callback_time_sec`. 

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We can revise the calculation for updating the next timeout to ensure it accurately reflects the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout += num_intervals * callback_time_sec
```
