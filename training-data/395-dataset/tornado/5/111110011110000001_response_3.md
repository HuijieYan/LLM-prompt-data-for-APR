The test case `test_clock_backwards` is simulating the behavior of the `PeriodicCallback` by calling it with a list of time differences. The expected result is the list of next timeouts returned by the `simulate_calls` method.

The error message indicates that the expected list of timeouts does not match the actual list of timeouts. The first differing element is at index 1, where `1010.0` is expected but `1020` is received.

The potential error location within the `_update_next` function is the line:
```python
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

The bug occurs because the method does not accurately handle cases where the current time is less than the next timeout. As a result, the calculation to update the next timeout does not behave as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation in the `_update_next` function to correctly handle cases where the current time is less than the next timeout.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # This is the corrected _update_next function
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            num_periods = math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            if num_periods >= 0:
                self._next_timeout += ((num_periods + 1) * callback_time_sec)
            else:
                self._next_timeout = current_time + callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected code, we first calculate the number of periods that have passed since the last timeout. If `num_periods` is greater than or equal to 0, we update the next timeout by adding the appropriate number of periods. If `num_periods` is less than 0, we set the next timeout to be the current time plus the callback time in seconds. This adjustment ensures that the periodic callback correctly handles cases where the current time is less than the next timeout.
