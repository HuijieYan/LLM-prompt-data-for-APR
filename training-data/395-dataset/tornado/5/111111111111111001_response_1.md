The error occurs because the buggy function `_update_next` does not correctly calculate the next timeout when the current time is smaller than the previously calculated next timeout. This causes the test case to fail because the expected values of the calculated next timeout are not being met.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the current time is smaller than the previously calculated next timeout. This causes the subsequent invocations of the callback to be skipped, leading to a slower schedule.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_update_next` function to properly calculate the next timeout even when the current time is smaller than the previously calculated next timeout.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (other code)

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_diff = (current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec
            if time_diff > 1:
                self._next_timeout = current_time + (math.floor(time_diff) + 1) * callback_time_sec
            else:
                self._next_timeout += callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected code, we first calculate the time difference between the current time and the previously calculated next timeout. If the time difference is greater than 1, we update the next timeout accordingly. Otherwise, we just add the callback time to the previously calculated next timeout.

This ensures that the next timeout is correctly updated even when the current time is smaller than the previously calculated next timeout.
