The test case `test_clock_backwards` is failing with an AssertionError. The error message indicates that the expected output for the function `simulate_calls` is `[1010, 1020, 1030, 1040, 1050]` but the actual output is `[1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0]`.

The potential error location within the `_update_next` function is the calculation of `self._next_timeout`. It seems that the calculation is not producing the expected result, leading to the failure of the test case.

The reason behind the bug could be a miscalculation in the formula used to update the next timeout. The use of `math.floor` and the conversion to `callback_time_sec` might be causing the issue in accurately updating the next timeout.

To fix the bug, a more straightforward and accurate approach for updating the next timeout could be to directly add the callback time to the current time and assign it to `self._next_timeout`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
# Corrected function
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        self._next_timeout = current_time + callback_time_sec
```

The corrected code directly adds the callback time to the current time and assigns it to `self._next_timeout`, ensuring an accurate update of the next timeout. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
