# Buggy function source code
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class PeriodicCallback(object):
    """
    Schedules the given callback to be called periodically.
    
    The callback is called every ``callback_time`` milliseconds.
    Note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, while most other
    time-related functions in Tornado use seconds.
    
    If the callback runs for longer than ``callback_time`` milliseconds,
    subsequent invocations will be skipped to get back on schedule.
    
    `start` must be called after the `PeriodicCallback` is created.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.
    """

        # don't currently. This trace shows that we run callbacks
        # every 10s of time.time(), but the first and second calls are
        # 110s of real time apart because the backwards jump is
