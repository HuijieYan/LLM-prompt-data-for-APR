The error occurs because the `_update_next` function is not correctly updating the `_next_timeout` value based on the current time and the callback time.

The bug is in the calculation of the updated `_next_timeout`. The logic should calculate the time for the next execution based on the current time and the callback time, and then update the `_next_timeout` with this calculated value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_update_next` function to correctly calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. We can then update the `_next_timeout` with this calculated value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback:
    def __init__(self, callback, callback_time):
        self.callback_time = callback_time
        self._next_timeout = 0
        self.callback = callback

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            self._next_timeout = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec + self._next_timeout
```

With this correction, the `_update_next` function properly updates the `_next_timeout` based on the current time and the callback time, and the test case should now pass without errors.
