1. The test case involves a PeriodicCallback that is supposed to run a function periodically according to a schedule. However, in the test case, the logs show that the function is executing more often than expected.

2. The potential error location within the code is the _update_next function in the PeriodicCallback class.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the _update_next function is not properly updating the next timeout, leading to the callback being executed more frequently than expected.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to correct the calculation in the _update_next function to properly update the next timeout according to the callback time.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            next_timeout = self._next_timeout
            self._next_timeout += math.ceil((current_time - next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec
```
