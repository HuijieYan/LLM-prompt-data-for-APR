The buggy function `_update_next` aims to calculate the next timeout based on the provided `callback_time` and the current time. However, there are multiple issues in the current implementation:

1. The initial value for `self._next_timeout` is an integer, but it should be a float to avoid type conflicts later on.
2. The calculation of the next timeout has a potential issue because it uses `math.floor` which could lead to discrepancies in the timeout calculation.

To fix this, the initial value of `self._next_timeout` should be converted to a float, and the next timeout calculation should be revised to ensure correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class PeriodicCallback(object):
    """
    Schedules the given callback to be called periodically.
    
    The callback is called every ``callback_time`` milliseconds.
    Note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, while most other
    time-related functions in Tornado use seconds.
    
    If the callback runs for longer than ``callback_time`` milliseconds,
    subsequent invocations will be skipped to get back on schedule.
    
    `start` must be called after the `PeriodicCallback` is created.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            num_periods = (current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec
            self._next_timeout += (math.ceil(num_periods)) * callback_time_sec
```
