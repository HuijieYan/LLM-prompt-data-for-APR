The problematic function is `_update_next` in the `tornado.ioloop` module. The function calculates the next timeout for the periodic callback.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the next timeout is not accurate which leads to the callback being executed too often on Windows.

The issue arises from the incorrect calculation of the next timeout using the formula:
```
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```
This calculation is causing the next timeout to be adjusted incorrectly, leading to the periodic callback being executed too often.

To fix this issue, the calculation for the next timeout should be modified to ensure it accurately calculates the next scheduled execution time.

Below is the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        intervals = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout += intervals * callback_time_sec
```

In this corrected code, the `math.floor` function has been replaced with `math.ceil` to accurately calculate the number of intervals needed to reach the next timeout. The adjustment to the next timeout now reflects the correct number of intervals, ensuring that the periodic callback executes at the expected frequency.
