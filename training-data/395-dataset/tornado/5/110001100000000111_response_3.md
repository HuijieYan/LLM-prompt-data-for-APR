The error seems to be related to the implementation of the `_update_next` function in the `ioloop.py` file. The function seems to be calculating the next timeout incorrectly, leading to frequent execution on Windows.

The potential error seems to be in the line that calculates the next timeout:
```python
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

The reason behind the bug is that the current implementation is not accurately calculating the next timeout, leading to incorrect scheduling and frequent execution.

To fix the bug, it is essential to correct the calculation of the next timeout in a way that accurately schedules the periodic callback.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_elapsed = current_time - self._next_timeout
        if time_elapsed <= 0:
            self._next_timeout += callback_time_sec
        else:
            callback_count = math.ceil(time_elapsed / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += callback_count * callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected code, we first calculate the `time_elapsed` to determine whether the callback execution is overdue. If it's overdue, we calculate the `callback_count` and update the `_next_timeout` accordingly. This approach ensures that the next timeout is accurately calculated, preventing frequent execution on Windows.
