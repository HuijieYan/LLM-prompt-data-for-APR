The problem is occurring in the `_update_next` function of the `PeriodicCallback` class. The function is supposed to calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. The error message from the test function indicates that the calculated values are not matching the expected values.

Upon analyzing the code and test case, it seems that the issue is with the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` function. The calculation is based on the "if" condition `if self._next_timeout <= current_time`, which is causing discrepancies in the calculated values.

The issue occurs because the condition `if self._next_timeout <= current_time` does not handle scenarios where the current time is less than the next timeout. This results in incorrect updates to the next timeout.

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculation logic for the next timeout. We can use the maximum of the current time and the calculated next timeout as the next timeout. This will ensure that the next timeout is always updated correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (other code)

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            next_timeout = self._next_timeout + callback_time_sec
            self._next_timeout = max(next_timeout, current_time + callback_time_sec)
```

By updating the calculation logic in this way, the bug should be fixed and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
