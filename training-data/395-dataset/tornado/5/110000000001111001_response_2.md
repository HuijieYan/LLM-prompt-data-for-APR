The bug in the given function is caused by incorrect calculation of the next timeout value. The calculation does not account for the difference between the current time and the next timeout, which leads to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the calculation of the next timeout value to properly consider the difference between the current time and the next timeout.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + num_intervals * callback_time_sec
```

In this corrected code, we calculate the time difference between the current time and the next timeout, then determine the number of intervals based on the callback time. We use `math.ceil` to round up to the nearest whole number of intervals. Finally, we update the next timeout value by adding the calculated number of intervals multiplied by the callback time. This should ensure that the next timeout is updated correctly based on the current time.
