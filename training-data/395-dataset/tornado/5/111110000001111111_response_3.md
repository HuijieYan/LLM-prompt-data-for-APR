The bug is in the `_update_next` function of the `PeriodicCallback` class. The bug occurs when the `_next_timeout` is not updated correctly after each execution of the callback function. This results in the callback function being called more often than it should be.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the next timeout is based on the difference between the current time and the next timeout, and the `callback_time` value is being used inappropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to update the calculation of the `_next_timeout` in the `_update_next` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... other code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
            next_timeout_offset = math.ceil(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec
            self._next_timeout += next_timeout_offset
```

This fix ensures that the `_next_timeout` is updated correctly based on the elapsed time and the `callback_time` value, preventing the callback function from being called too often.
