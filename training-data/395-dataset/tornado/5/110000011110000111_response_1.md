The test case `test_clock_backwards` simulates calls to the `PeriodicCallback` with a negative time, which should be ignored, and then checks if the callback times are correct. The error message indicates that the callback times are not as expected.

The potential error location within the `_update_next` method is the calculation of `self._next_timeout` using the callback time and the current time. It seems that this calculation is not accurately updating `self._next_timeout` as expected.

The bug occurs because the calculation of `self._next_timeout` is incorrect. The intention of the code is to update `self._next_timeout` to the next timeout time based on the callback time, but due to the incorrect calculation, it is not updating `self._next_timeout` as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the calculation of `self._next_timeout` in the `_update_next` method. We should calculate the number of whole intervals between `current_time` and `self._next_timeout`, then add the appropriate number of callback intervals to `self._next_timeout` to get the next timeout time.

The corrected code for the `_update_next` method with the fix is as follows:

```python
import math

# this is the corrected and bug-fixed function
def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        intervals = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout += (intervals * callback_time_sec)
```
With this fix, the calculation of `self._next_timeout` is updated accurately based on the callback time and the current time.
