The error seems to be related to the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` function of the `PeriodicCallback` class. The function calculates the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time, and it seems to be producing incorrect results.

Upon analysis, it appears that the error is caused by incorrectly updating the `_next_timeout` variable. The problem is specifically related to converting `callback_time` to seconds and adding it to `_next_timeout`.

The calculation for updating `_next_timeout` seems to be incorrect, resulting in a discrepancy between the expected and actual values.

One approach to fix this issue could be to use milliseconds for all time-related variables and calculations, ensuring consistency in units to avoid potential errors. Additionally, the calculation for updating `_next_timeout` based on the current time and the callback time should be carefully reviewed and corrected to accurately reflect the intended behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

...

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.ceil(abs(time_diff / callback_time_sec))
        self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_intervals * callback_time_sec)
```

This corrected code ensures that the calculation for updating `_next_timeout` is properly performed and should resolve the issue.
