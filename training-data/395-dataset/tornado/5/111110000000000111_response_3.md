The issue seems to be related to the periodic callback function not executing correctly on Windows. The error message indicates that the callback is executing too often, and the logs show that the delay and last execute time are not being calculated correctly.

Potential error location:
The `_update_next` function seems to be where the bug is located. It appears that the calculation for the next timeout is not accurate, causing the callback to execute too often and at incorrect intervals.

Reasons behind the bug:
The calculation for the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time is not being performed correctly. This results in the callback being scheduled too frequently and not at the proper intervals.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the calculation for the next timeout accurately reflects the desired interval for the periodic callback.
2. Check for any discrepancies between platforms (e.g., Windows vs. Linux) that might affect the timing and scheduling of the callback.

Corrected code for the `_update_next` function:
```python
def _update_next(self, current_time):
    while self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        self._next_timeout += self.callback_time
```

In the corrected code, the `_update_next` function incrementally adds the callback time to the next timeout until it exceeds the current time, ensuring that the callback is scheduled at the correct intervals without executing too often.
