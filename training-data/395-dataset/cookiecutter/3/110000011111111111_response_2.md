The error message indicates that the `prompt.assert_called_once_with` method is failing because it is expecting the call to `prompt` with the 'show_choices' parameter set to False. However, it is not receiving the expected parameters, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the function is where the click.prompt is being called. The prompt is being called without the 'show_choices' parameter being set to False.

The bug occurred because the test is asserting that when the prompt is called, the 'show_choices' parameter should be set to False. However, in the function `read_user_choice`, the click.prompt method is being called without providing the 'show_choices' parameter.

To fix the bug, the click.prompt method should be called with the parameter 'show_choices=False'. This can be accomplished by adding 'show_choices=False' to the parameter list of click.prompt in the `read_user_choice` function.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
