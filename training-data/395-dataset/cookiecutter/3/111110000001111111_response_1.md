The error in the provided function is related to the `click` module being used without being imported. The function is using `click.prompt` for user input without importing the `click` module, resulting in a NameError.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `click` module at the beginning of the code. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

By importing the `click` module and using its `prompt` method, the function should work as intended.
