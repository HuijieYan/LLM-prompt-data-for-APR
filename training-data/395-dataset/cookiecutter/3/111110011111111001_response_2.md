The error is in the assertion of the test case, where the `show_choices` attribute is set to `False` but not expected. The error message indicates that the `show_choices` attribute is not matching the expected value.

The bug is likely in the way `click.prompt` is invoked in the `read_user_choice` function. The `show_choices` attribute is not handled correctly in the `click.prompt` invocation, leading to the mismatch in the test case.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `show_choices` attribute is set correctly in the `click.prompt` invocation.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())  # Convert to list since we need list
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=True  # Fixed the prompt call
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]

```

With this corrected function, the `click.prompt` call includes the `show_choices=True` attribute, ensuring that the choices are shown as expected. This should resolve the issue in the test case and make the function work as intended.
