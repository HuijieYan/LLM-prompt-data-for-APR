The test case is designed to check the functionality of the `read_user_choice` function by using the `click.prompt` method. The error message indicates that there are inconsistencies between the expected and actual calls to `prompt` during the test cases.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `read_user_choice` function itself, specifically in the way it interacts with `click.prompt`. It seems that there is an issue with the interaction of `click.Choice` as the type parameter in the `click.prompt` method call.

The bug occurs because the `click.Choice` object is not being used correctatly. The `show_choices` argument, which is set as `False`, is not being handled in the `click.prompt` method call, leading to inconsistencies between the expected and actual calls during the test cases.

To fix the bug, the `show_choices` argument should be handled correctly in the `click.prompt` method call. This involves adding the `show_choices=False` argument to the `click.prompt` method call in the `read_user_choice` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    # existing code...

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

This change ensures that the `show_choices` argument is handled correctly when calling the `click.prompt` method within the `read_user_choice` function.
