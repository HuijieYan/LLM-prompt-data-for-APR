The error message appears to be asserting that the 'show_choices' argument should be False, but it is not being passed to the `prompt` function when it is called.

The bug is located in the `read_user_choice` function. The `show_choices` argument should be added when calling the `click.prompt` function to ensure that it is used correctly.

The bug occurs because the `show_choices` argument is not being provided when calling the `click.prompt` function, which leads to the test cases failing.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the `show_choices` argument when calling the `click.prompt` function. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the `show_choices` value is set to `False` when invoking the `click.prompt` function. 

Here is the corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = '1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
