The error message indicates that the `prompt` method is being called with different arguments compared to the expected ones. This error occurs during the `assert_called_once_with` step, which suggests that the `prompt` method is not being called with the expected arguments and also not being called exactly once.

The bug is likely due to the way the prompt is being defined in the `read_user_choice` method. The `prompt` might not be implemented correctly, causing the test case to fail.

To fix this bug, the `click.prompt` method should be used to properly prompt the user for input. Additionally, the order of the arguments should be verified because if the arguments are in different order, it might result in a failure.

Here's the corrected function for the `read_user_choice` method:

```python
import click
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

This code uses `click.prompt` correctly and ensures that the `prompt` method is called with the expected arguments and in the correct order.
