The error is occurring in the `read_user_choice` function due to the incorrect use of the `click.prompt` function in the function. The `prompt` function is not being called correctly in the `read_user_choice` function, which is causing the test cases to fail.

The correct way to call `click.prompt` function is by providing the `show_choices=False` as one of the arguments. 

In the provided code, the `prompt` function is being called as:

```python
user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
```
To fix the bug, we should modify the code to call the `click.prompt` function as follows:

```python
user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
```

This modification should resolve the issue and ensure that the `click.prompt` function is being called correctly. After making this change, the function should work as expected.

The corrected `read_user_choice` function is as follows:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
