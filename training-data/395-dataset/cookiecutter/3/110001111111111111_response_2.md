Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the `read_user_choice` function, specifically in the way the `click.prompt` function is being used. The error message indicates that the `show_choices` argument is not being passed as expected.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The function `click.prompt` is expected to be called with certain arguments, including `show_choices=False`, but it seems that this argument is not being passed correctly or as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the usage of the `click.prompt` function to ensure that the `show_choices` argument is passed correctly.
2. Verify the version compatibility of the `click` library being used, as certain versions may have different argument requirements.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
