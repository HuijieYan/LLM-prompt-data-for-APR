The error message from the test function indicates that the `prompt` function is being called with a parameter `show_choices=False`, but in the buggy function, there is no mention of this parameter being used. This likely indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual calls.

Additionally, the parameters being passed to the `prompt` function in the test function do not match the error message, which suggests that there may be a misalignment of parameters.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug are:
1. Remove the `show_choices=False` from the `assert_called_once_with` statement in the test function if `show_choices` is not actually used in the `prompt` function in the buggy function.
2. If `show_choices` is actually required in the `prompt` function, then it should be added to the `click.prompt` call in the `read_user_choice` function, and the test function should be updated to match.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = '1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

The corrected function includes the addition of the `show_choices=False` parameter in the `click.prompt` call. This change will align the test function's assertions with the actual function call.
