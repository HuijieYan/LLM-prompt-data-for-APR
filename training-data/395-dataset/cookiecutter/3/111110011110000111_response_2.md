The error message indicates that the `click.prompt` function is being called with a different set of kwargs than expected. This discrepancy is causing the test function to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the usage of `show_choices` in the call to `click.prompt`, which is not consistent with what the test expects.

The bug occurs because the `show_choices` parameter is not consistent between the actual call and the expected call within the test function. The `show_choices` parameter should be set to `False` in order for the test to pass.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the call to `click.prompt` inside the `read_user_choice` function to include the `show_choices` parameter explicitly as `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

With this correction, the code should now be consistent with the expected calling behavior in the test function.
