An issue is detected in the test case. The mock assertion `prompt.assert_called_once_with()` is failing because the `show_choices` key is expected to be `False`, but it is not being set in the call to `prompt`. 

The problem is caused by the logic in the `read_user_choice` function. The `show_choices` parameter is not being added when constructing the prompt in the `read_user_choice` function, and it is expected in the test case.

To fix this issue, we should update the `read_user_choice` function to include the `show_choices=False` parameter when constructing the prompt. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    # ... (existing code)

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

With this fix, the `show_choices` parameter will be set to `False` in the calls to `prompt`, aligning it with the expectation in the test case.
