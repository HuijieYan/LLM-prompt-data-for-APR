The error in the given function `read_user_choice` is that it uses the `click.prompt` function, which is not defined within the function itself or imported in the module. Therefore, it raises an error when the function is called.

##### Reason for the Occurrence of Bug:
The bug occurred because the `click.prompt` function was not properly imported or defined within the scope of the `read_user_choice` function.

##### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. The `click.prompt` function should be imported at the beginning of the file where `read_user_choice` is defined. Or it can be explicitly defined within the function if it's a custom function.
2. If `click` is not an external library, it could be an internal package. In this case, make sure the correct import path is used.

##### Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
import click  # Importing click to use click.prompt

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.
    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default)
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
