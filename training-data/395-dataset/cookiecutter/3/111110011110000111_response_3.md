The error message is related to the `pytest` test case `test_click_invocation`. The test case is trying to assert that the `read_user_choice` function calls `click.prompt` with certain arguments.

The potential error location within the `read_user_choice` function is likely in the line where `click.prompt` is being called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `click.prompt` call inside the `read_user_choice` function is not matching the expected arguments in the test case.

To fix this bug, the `click.prompt` call in the `read_user_choice` function should be modified to match the expected arguments passed in the test case.

Below is the corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict  # Add the import statement for OrderedDict
import click  # Add the import statement for click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("Options must be a list")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("Options list cannot be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())  # Convert the keys to a list
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(  # Use click.prompt to get user input
        prompt,
        type=click.Choice(choices),
        default=default,
        show_choices=False  # Add show_choices argument
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]

```

In this corrected code, the unsuitable use of `click.Choice` was fixed. Two parameters, `default` and `show_choices`, have been included in the `click.prompt` call to match the expected arguments from the test case. Additionally, the import statements for `OrderedDict` and `click` have been added at the beginning of the code.
