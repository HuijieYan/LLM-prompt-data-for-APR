The error in the provided code is related to the `click.prompt` method and how it should be called with the expected arguments. The error message indicates that `show_choices=False` is expected as an argument in the `prompt` method, but it's not being called with this argument.

The bug in the function is occurring because the expected argument `show_choices=False` is not being used in the `click.prompt` method. This is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the `click.prompt` method should be called with the `show_choices=False` argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("Options should be a list")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("Options cannot be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(map(str, choice_map.keys()))  # Ensure the keys are strings
    default = '1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

With this correction, the `click.prompt` method is called with the `show_choices=False` argument, which should resolve the issues mentioned in the error messages.
