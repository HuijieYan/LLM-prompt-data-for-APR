The issue with the provided function is that the `click.prompt` method is not being called correctly. According to the error messages, the arguments for `show_choices` are missing in the call.

The potential error location is the line where `click.prompt` is called. It seems that the `show_choices` argument is not being passed correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `show_choices` argument is not being passed in the call to `click.prompt` as expected. This is causing the test to fail as it expects this argument to be present in the call.

To fix the bug, the `show_choices` argument should be added to the call to `click.prompt`. Also, the `prompt.assert_called_once_with` statement in the test function should be updated to include the `show_choices` argument.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("options must be a list")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("options cannot be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

The corrected code ensures that the `show_choices` argument is passed correctly to the `click.prompt` call.
