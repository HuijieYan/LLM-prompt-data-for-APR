Potential error location: It seems like the function is using the click library, but it has not been imported. This could be the reason for the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The click library is missing, and thus the click.prompt() function is not recognized.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the click library at the beginning of the file.
2. Make sure that the click library is installed in the Python environment where the function is being used.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/cookiecutter_3/cookiecutter/prompt.py
import click
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
