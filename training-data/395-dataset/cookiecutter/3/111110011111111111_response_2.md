The error message suggests that the `prompt.assert_called_once_with` assertion in the test function is failing. The expected call includes `expected = ('Select varname:\n1 - hello\n2 - world\n3 - foo\n4 - bar\nChoose from 1, 2, 3, 4', {'default': '1', 'show_choices': False, 'type': <MagicMock name='Choice()' id='4351060432'>})`, but the actual call did not include `show_choices=False`.

The bug is likely occurring somewhere in the `read_user_choice` function, where the `prompt` function is being called. It seems that the `show_choices` parameter is supposed to be passed as `False`, but in the actual call, it's not being passed.

This bug is likely causing the `prompt.assert_called_once_with` assertion to fail because the expected call and the actual call don't match, specifically in terms of the `show_choices` parameter.

To fix this bug, the `read_user_choice` function needs to ensure that the `show_choices` parameter is correctly passed to the `click.prompt` function. This could involve modifying the function to pass `show_choices=False` to the `prompt` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function:

```python
import click
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )

    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )

    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

In this corrected code, the `click.prompt` function is called with the `show_choices=False` parameter to ensure that it matches the expected call in the test function.
