The error is occurring in the `generate_context` function. It seems that the function is trying to open a file using the `context_file` path, but it is unable to find the file at the specified location, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError` in the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to open the `context_file` without considering its complete path. It seems that the path to the context file is not being constructed correctly.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to construct the complete path to the `context_file` by using the `os.path` module to join the path with the file name. Additionally, it is also necessary to import the required libraries such as `os` and `json`. Lastly, we would need to fix the indentation of the whole function and correct the `except` block to handle the `FileNotFoundError` exception.

Here is the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict

def apply_overwrites_to_context(context, overwrite_context):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    context_file = os.path.abspath(context_file)  # Construct complete path to context_file

    try:
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except FileNotFoundError as e:  # Handle FileNotFoundError
        raise FileNotFoundError(f'Error while loading "{context_file}": {e}')

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```
