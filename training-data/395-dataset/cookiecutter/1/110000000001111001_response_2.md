The bug in the function `generate_context` seems to be related to the use of the `obj` variable. The function is attempting to add the Python object `obj` to the context dictionary, but the variable `obj` is not being defined properly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access it in the `apply_overwrites_to_context` function.

The reason for the bug is likely that the code is trying to access the `obj` variable in the `context` dictionary before it has been properly defined, possibly due to an error in the JSON decoding process or an issue with how the `obj` variable is being assigned.

To fix this bug, the `obj` variable needs to be properly defined by correctly loading the JSON data from the `context_file`.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    context = OrderedDict([])

    try:
        with open(context_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            f'JSON decoding error while loading "{full_fpath}". Decoding error details: "{json_exc_message}"'
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    return context
``` 

In the corrected code:
- We are opening the `context_file` with the correct encoding and using `json.load` to properly load the JSON data into the `obj` variable.
- We are using formatted string literals (f-strings) for the error message for better readability.
- We are returning the context without any logging as the original logger is not available in the given code snippet.
