The error message indicates a FileNotFoundError, suggesting that the function is trying to open a file that does not exist.

The potential error location within the function is the try-except block where it tries to open the context_file. If the file specified in `context_file` does not exist, a FileNotFoundError will be raised.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to load the content from 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json', but the file does not exist at that location.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file specified in `context_file` exists before trying to load its content. We also need to import the necessary modules at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict

class ContextDecodingException(Exception):
    pass

def generate_context(context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    if os.path.exists(context_file):  # Check if the file exists
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    else:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File '{context_file}' does not exist")

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```
