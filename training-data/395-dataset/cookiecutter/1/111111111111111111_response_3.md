The error message indicates that the function `generate_context` is trying to open a file that does not exist. This issue arises because the file path provided to the `context_file` parameter is not properly referencing the location of the JSON file.

The potential error location is within the `with open(context_file) as file_handle` line in the `generate_context` function.

The bug occurs because the `context_file` parameter is only provided with the file name, but it should include the full path to the file. When the function attempts to open the file using just the file name, it cannot find the file.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle the full path to the JSON file properly. This might involve either passing the full path to the `context_file` parameter or constructing the full path within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import os
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

# corrected generate_context function
def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    # Construct the full path to the JSON file
    full_context_file = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), context_file)

    try:
        with open(full_context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error handling
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(full_context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
``` 

In this corrected code, the `os.path.join(os.getcwd(), context_file)` line constructs the full path to the JSON file using the current working directory and the provided file name. This ensures that the file can be found and opened successfully.
