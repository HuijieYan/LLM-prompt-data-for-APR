The error message indicates that the function is trying to open a file that does not exist, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. This is likely because the function `generate_context` is expecting the `context_file` to be in a specific location or format that is not being provided in the test case.

To fix this issue, a few potential approaches could be:
1. Update the test case to ensure that the `context_file` exists in the specified location.
2. Modify the `generate_context` function to accept a full file path instead of assuming a specific directory structure.
3. If the `context_file` is expected to be located in a specific directory, update the test environment to include the necessary file.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import os
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

class ContextDecodingException(Exception):
    pass

def apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, overrides):
    for key, value in overrides.items():
        obj[key] = value

def generate_context(context_file, default_context=None, extra_context=None):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    try:
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    return context
```

The corrected code uses the `context_file` parameter as the absolute file path, allowing the function to open the file from any location. This change should resolve the `FileNotFoundError` issue encountered in the test case.
