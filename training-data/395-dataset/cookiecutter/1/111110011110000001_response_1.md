The error message states that the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' was not found. This indicates that the function `generate_context` is trying to open the file 'non_ascii.json' in a specific location, but it is unable to find it.

The potential error location within the `generate_context` function is in the line:
```python
with open(context_file) as file_handle:
```
This line is attempting to open the file specified by `context_file`, but it does not include the full path to the file, so it is looking for the file in the wrong location.

The reason behind this bug is that the `context_file` parameter only includes the filename, not the full path. Therefore, when trying to open the file, the function is looking for it in the wrong location.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to modify the `generate_context` function to accept a full file path instead of just a filename. This way, the function will know exactly where to find the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import os
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

def generate_context(context_file='path_to_context_file/cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: Full path to the JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    try:
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```

In this corrected code, the `context_file` parameter now includes the full path to the JSON file, ensuring that the function will look for the file in the correct location.
