The error message indicates a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file `'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json'`. This error suggests that the file is not being found at the specified location, which is likely causing the bug.

The potential error location within the function is in the `with open(context_file) as file_handle` line, where the `context_file` variable is used to open the file. It seems that the file path provided in the `context_file` parameter is incorrect, leading to the `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file.

The bug occurs because the provided file path in the `context_file` parameter is not accurate or does not exist. This causes the function to raise a `FileNotFoundError` when attempting to open the file.

To fix the bug, the correct file path should be provided in the `context_file` parameter, ensuring that the file exists at the specified location.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict

def apply_overwrites_to_context(context, overwrite_context):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.
    
    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.
    
    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])
    
    try:
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    return context
```

In this corrected code, make sure to provide the correct file path for the `context_file` parameter when calling the `generate_context` function to avoid the `FileNotFoundError`.
