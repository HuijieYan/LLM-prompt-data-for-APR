The error message indicates that the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' cannot be found. This error occurs within the function `generate_context` when it attempts to open the specified file.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is attempting to open a file without referencing the correct file path. It is assuming that the file is located in the current working directory, which may not be the case. This assumption causes the function to fail in finding the file.

To fix this bug, the function should use an absolute or relative path to locate the JSON file. This ensures that the function can find and open the file regardless of the current working directory.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    try:
        with open(os.path.abspath(context_file)) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # Exception handling code remains the same as the original
        raise

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```
