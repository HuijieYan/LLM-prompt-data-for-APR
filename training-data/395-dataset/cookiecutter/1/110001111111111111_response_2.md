The error message indicates that the "FileNotFoundError" occurred when trying to open the "non_ascii.json" file. This gives us a clear indication that the issue is related to the file path.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `with open(context_file) as file_handle`. This line is attempting to open the file specified by the `context_file` variable, but it seems that the path to the file is incorrect, leading to the "FileNotFoundError" exception.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The file path specified by the `context_file` variable is incorrect, leading to the "FileNotFoundError" exception.
2. The `context_file` parameter does not contain the correct path to the file.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `context_file` parameter contains the correct path to the file.
2. Use absolute paths for the file to avoid any relative path issues.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/cookiecutter_1/cookiecutter/generate.py

import os

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    context_file_path = os.path.abspath(context_file)  # Convert to absolute path

    try:
        with open(context_file_path) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # ... (remaining code) ...
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In this corrected code:
- The `os.path.abspath(context_file)` is used to convert the relative file path to an absolute file path. This ensures that the file is found regardless of the current working directory.
- The rest of the function remains unchanged from the original function.
