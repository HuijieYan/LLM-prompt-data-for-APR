The error message indicates that the file 'non_ascii.json' cannot be found, which is causing the FileNotFoundError. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the file opening part:
```python
with open(context_file) as file_handle:
```

The reason behind this bug is that the function is trying to open a file that does not exist. This could be due to the incorrect file path or the file not being present at the specified location.

To fix this bug, we can consider the following approaches:
1. Verify that the file 'non_ascii.json' exists at the specified location.
2. Ensure that the file path provided in the `context_file` parameter is correct.
3. Use relative or absolute file paths as per the project structure to ensure the file is located and opened successfully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

class ContextDecodingException(Exception):
    pass

def apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, overrides):
    obj.update(overrides)

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    context_file = os.path.abspath(context_file)  # Get absolute file path

    try:
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {context_file}")
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
