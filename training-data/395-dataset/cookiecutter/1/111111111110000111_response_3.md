The error message indicates a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json'. This suggests that the file is not found at the specified location.

The potential error location within the `generate_context` function is the line where the file is opened: `with open(context_file) as file_handle:`

The reason for the bug is that the function is trying to open a file based on the `context_file` parameter without considering the path to the file. As a result, it is unable to find the file and raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the function has access to the correct file path. This can be achieved by providing the absolute path to the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import os

def generate_context(context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    context_file_path = os.path.abspath(context_file)

    try:
        with open(context_file_path) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file_path)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```

In this corrected code, we use `os.path.abspath()` to obtain the absolute path of the `context_file`, ensuring that the file can be found and opened successfully.
