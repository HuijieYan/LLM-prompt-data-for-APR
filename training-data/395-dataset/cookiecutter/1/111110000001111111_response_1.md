The error occurs because the `json` module is imported but not used in the function. This is causing the `json.load` function to be called without the `json` module being referenced.

To fix this, the `import json` statement needs to be added at the beginning of the file. Additionally, the variable `obj` should be initialized as an empty `OrderedDict` before the `json.load` function is called to avoid a `NameError`. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import json  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    obj = OrderedDict([])  # Initialize obj as an empty OrderedDict

    try:
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged...
```
