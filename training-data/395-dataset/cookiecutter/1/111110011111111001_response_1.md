Potential Error Location:
The `generate_context` function is failing to open the `non_ascii.json` file, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError`. This indicates that there might be an issue with the file path or the file might not exist at the specified location.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the function is attempting to open a file based on the provided `context_file` path, but it is unable to locate the file at that location.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. One possible approach is to ensure that the file `non_ascii.json` exists at the specified location or modify the file path to point to the correct location.
2. Provide proper error handling to alert the user when the file is not found or does not exist.
3. Check for any potential issues with the file path format, such as incorrect slashes or backslashes.

Corrected Code for the `generate_context` Function:
```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict

class ContextDecodingException(Exception):
    pass

def generate_context(context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict()

    try:
        with open(context_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {context_file}")
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    return context
```

In the corrected code:
- Proper error handling has been added to handle `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError` exceptions.
- The context dictionary is initialized without providing an optional list.
- The file is opened with explicit encoding and mode parameters.
- The `OrderedDict` import is explicitly mentioned.
- The logger functionality has been removed as it is not defined in the provided context.
