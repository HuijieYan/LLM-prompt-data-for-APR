The error message indicates that the function `generate_context` is trying to open a file ('tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json') that does not exist, leading to a FileNotFoundError. This is likely the cause of the bug.

The potential error location within the `generate_context` function is the `with open(context_file) as file_handle` line, where it tries to open the context_file without checking whether the file actually exists.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the case when the context_file does not exist. It directly tries to open the file without verifying its existence, leading to the FileNotFoundError.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to verify if the context_file exists before trying to open it. We can use the `os.path.exists()` function to check if the file exists.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict

# relative function's signature in this file
def apply_overwrites_to_context(context, overwrite_context):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_context(context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    if os.path.exists(context_file):
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    else:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Context file {context_file} does not exist")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding the check for the existence of the context_file, we can prevent the FileNotFoundError from occurring and ensure that the function behaves as intended.
