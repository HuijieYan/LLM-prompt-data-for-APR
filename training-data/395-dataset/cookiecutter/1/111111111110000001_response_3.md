The test case "test_generate_context_decodes_non_ascii_chars" is trying to generate a context from a given JSON file, but it's encountering a FileNotFoundError when trying to open the file "tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json".

The potential error location in the generate_context function is the try block where it tries to open the context_file. This is where the FileNotFoundError is likely being raised.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to open a file based on the input context_file path, but it's not finding the file at the specified location.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the context_file exists at the specified location before trying to open it. We can use the pathlib module to check for the existence of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the generate_context function with the bug fix:

```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict
from pathlib import Path

def apply_overwrites_to_context(context, overwrite_context):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    context_file_path = Path(context_file)

    if context_file_path.is_file():
        with context_file_path.open() as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    else:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File '{context_file}' not found")

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = context_file_path.name
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```
