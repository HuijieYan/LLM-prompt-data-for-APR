The error message indicates that there is a FileNotFoundError when trying to open the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' within the `generate_context` function.

The potential error location is the `with open(context_file) as file_handle` line, as it is responsible for opening the file specified by `context_file`.

The bug occurred because the `generate_context` function is trying to open a file without including the correct path to the file. It is looking for the file 'non_ascii.json' directly in the current working directory, instead of looking within the 'tests/test-generate-context/' directory.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the path to the context file is correctly constructed, considering its relative location to the current working directory.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import os

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    # Construct the absolute path to the context file
    context_file_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), context_file)

    try:
        with open(context_file_path) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
