The error message in the test indicates a "FileNotFoundError" when trying to open 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' in the `generate_context` function.

The potential error location is within the `generate_context` function where the file is being opened.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to open a file that does not exist or is not in the path specified.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the file path is correct and that the file exists before attempting to open it.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import json
from collections import OrderedDict
import os

class ContextDecodingException(Exception):
    pass

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    if not os.path.exists(context_file):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f'The file {context_file} does not exist.')

    try:
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the file exists before attempting to open it. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised with a corresponding message. This should prevent the "FileNotFoundError" from occurring in the test.
