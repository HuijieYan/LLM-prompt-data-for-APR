The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of NaN values when casting a categorical array to an integer dtype. The code does not handle NaN values correctly and instead converts them to unexpected negative integer values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it handles the conversion from categorical to integer dtype, specifically when there are NaN values present in the array.

The bug occurs because the code does not have proper handling for NaN values when converting from categorical to integer dtype. It seems to be treating NaN values as a regular integer, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle NaN values when converting from categorical to integer dtype. It should ensure that NaN values are also properly handled and not converted to unexpected integer values.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to explicitly check for NaN values in the array before casting to an integer dtype. If NaN values are present, they should be converted to NaN in the integer dtype as well. Properly handling NaN values during the conversion process is crucial for the correct behavior of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if arr.hasnans:
            # Convert NaN values to NaN in integer dtype
            new_arr = arr.astype('Int64')
            return new_arr
        else:
            return arr.astype(dtype)
    # other parts remain unchanged
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check if the input array is of categorical type using `pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr)` and then handle NaN values appropriately by converting them to NaN in the integer dtype using `arr.astype('Int64')`. This ensures that NaN values are properly handled when converting from categorical to integer dtype.
