The error message indicates that the `astype_nansafe` function did not raise a `ValueError`, which means there is an issue with the function not raising the expected error when converting NaT values to integer.

The potential error location within the `astype_nansafe` function could be in the section that handles the conversion of NaT values to integer.

The bug is likely occurring because the function does not handle the conversion of NaT values to integer as expected, resulting in the function not raising the `ValueError` as it should.

To fix the bug, the section of the function that handles the conversion of NaT values to integer should be reviewed and corrected to raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert NaT values to integer.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and dtype == np.int64:
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.timedelta64) and dtype == np.int64:
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

In the corrected code, we added checks for the specific case when the input array `arr` has a dtype of `datetime64` or `timedelta64` and the requested `dtype` is `int64`. If this condition is met, we raise a `ValueError` as per the expected behavior in the test cases.
