Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the handling of NaN values when casting categorical data to int.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `astype_nansafe` is not handling the conversion from categorical data to int properly, specifically when dealing with NaN values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for NaN values in categorical data before conversion to int and handle them appropriately.
2. Modify the logic for handling categorical data when casting to int to ensure that NaN values are not converted to incorrect integer values.

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if is_categorical_dtype(arr):
        if dtype == np.int64:
            if skipna:
                return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
            else:
                # Handle NaN values by converting them to np.nan
                result = arr.astype(dtype)
                result[arr.isna()] = np.nan
                return result

    # ... (remaining logic for other data types)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In this corrected code, we added a specific check for categorical dtype and int dtype. If the dtype is int64 and the array is categorical, it handles NaN values by setting them to np.nan before casting to int.
