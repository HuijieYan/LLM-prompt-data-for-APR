The test function `test_astype_nansafe` is designed to check if the `astype_nansafe` function raises a ValueError when attempting to cast a specific array with `NaT` values to a specific data type. The error message from the test function indicates that the expected ValueError was not raised, which suggests a bug in the `astype_nansafe` function.

Upon analyzing the `astype_nansafe` function, it appears that the bug may be related to the handling of NaN values when casting to an integer dtype. The function attempts to cast NaN values to integer without proper handling, leading to unexpected behavior and the failure of the test case.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle NaN values properly when casting to an integer datatype. It attempts to convert NaN values to integers directly, which is not supported and leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `astype_nansafe` function to properly handle NaN values when casting to an integer datatype. This can be achieved by explicitly checking for NaN values and either raising a ValueError or converting them to a suitable representation (e.g., None or NaN) for the target datatype.

Below is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and np.isnan(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We explicitly check if the target datatype is an integer type and if there are NaN values in the array.
2. If both conditions are satisfied, we raise a ValueError to indicate that NaN values cannot be converted to integer.
3. Otherwise, we use the `arr.astype` function to perform the required type conversion with proper handling of NaN values.

By making these changes, the function should now handle NaN values properly when casting to an integer datatype, effectively fixing the bug.

It's important to test the corrected function with different input arrays and datatypes to ensure that it handles NaN values correctly and produces the expected results.
