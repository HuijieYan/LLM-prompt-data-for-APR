The bug in the provided function `tz_localize` is likely due to the unawareness of how daylight saving time (DST) affects the frequency of datetime indexes in pandas. When the time zone is localized to None, the frequency is not updated to reflect the changes caused by DST in the index.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the frequency is still consistent with the new localized index and update the frequency accordingly. If the frequency is no longer consistent due to DST changes, it should be set to None.

Here's the corrected function for `tz_localize`:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # code to handle tz conversion
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    
    # check if frequency is consistent or set it to None
    if freq is not None and (self.freq is not None) and (self.freq.is_anchored()):
        if len(self.freq) > 1:
            freq = None
        else:
            inferred = self.freq.inferred_freq
            if inferred is not None:
                freq = inferred
    
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

In this corrected code, the frequency `freq` of the new index is updated to reflect the changes caused by DST. If the frequency is no longer consistent, it is set to `None`. This ensures that the frequency of the index is accurately represented after the localization operation.
