Based on the provided GitHub issue and the code, it seems that the issue lies in the `tz_localize` function not updating the frequency after localizing the index to None, especially in the case of Daylight Saving Time switch.

The reason for the bug is that the `tz_localize` function does not update the frequency attribute after localizing the index to None. This leads to an inconsistency where the frequency is still retained even after localizing to None, which is not the expected behavior, especially in the context of Daylight Saving Time changes.

To fix this, the `tz_localize` function needs to update the frequency attribute to None if it is not inferrable after localizing the index to None.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    """
    Localize tz-naive Datetime Array/Index to tz-aware
    Datetime Array/Index.

    ... (other code remains the same) ...

    Returns
    -------
    Same type as self
        Array/Index converted to the specified time zone.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the Datetime Array/Index is tz-aware and tz is not None.
    """
    # Previous code remains the same

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    new_index = self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=self.freq)

    if tz is None:
        new_index.freq = new_index.inferred_freq  # drop the frequency if not inferrable

    return new_index
```

In the corrected code, after localizing the index to None, we update the `freq` attribute to `inferred_freq` if it is not inferrable. This approach ensures that the frequency is correctly updated after localizing the index to None, addressing the inconsistency issue described in the GitHub issue.
