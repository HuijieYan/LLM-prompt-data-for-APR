The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)` which sets the dtype of the new dates to `DT64NS_DTYPE`, regardless of whether the frequency should become None due to Daylight Saving Time switch.

The bug occurs because the `tz_localize` function does not correctly handle the case where the frequency of the index should become None due to Daylight Saving Time switch. It always sets the dtype of the new dates to `DT64NS_DTYPE`, which may not be consistent with the new localized index.

To fix the bug, the `tz_localize` function should check if the frequency of the index should become None, and update the dtype accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... other code ...

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
            freq = self.freq if tzconversion.needs_filling_of_dst_gaps(self.asi8, self.tz) else None
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent)
        freq = self.freq if tzconversion.needs_filling_of_dst_gaps(self.asi8, tz) else None

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected code, after localizing the index to the new timezone, the `tz_localize` function checks if the frequency should become None due to potential DST gaps. If it should, then the `freq` parameter for the `_simple_new` method is set to None, indicating that the frequency of the index is no longer applicable.
