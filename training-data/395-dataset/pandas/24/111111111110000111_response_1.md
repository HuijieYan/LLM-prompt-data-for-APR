The test fails with the error message: `assert result.freq is None`. The error indicates that after performing `dti.tz_localize("US/Eastern", nonexistent="shift_forward")`, the resulting frequency is not None as expected.

The potential error location within the `tz_localize` function is likely related to the handling of frequency preservation after localization, especially in cases where there is a Daylight Saving Time transition.

The bug occurs because the `tz_localize` function fails to update the frequency attribute when it should indeed become None due to the creation of duplicated or missing timestamps during a Daylight Saving Time transition.

To fix the bug, the `tz_localize` function needs to be modified to update the frequency attribute based on whether it is inferrable or not after performing the localization.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ...omitted code...
    new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
        self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
    )
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)

    # Updated code to handle frequency preservation after localization
    if self.freq is not None and nonexistent in ("shift_forward", "shift_backward", "raise"):
        new_freq = None  # Set frequency to None in case of Daylight Saving Time transition
    else:
        new_freq = self.freq

    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=new_freq)
```

With this correction, the `tz_localize` function should now handle the frequency attribute appropriately when performing localization, especially in cases of Daylight Saving Time transitions.
