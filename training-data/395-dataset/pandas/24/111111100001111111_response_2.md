The issue arises because the `tz_localize` function does not handle frequencies properly when localizing a timezone-naive index. As a result, the frequency of the index is not updated to reflect the absence of a timezone.

To fix this issue, the `tz_localize` function needs to include a check to update the frequency of the index to None if it's no longer inferrable after localization.

Here's the corrected `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... other code ...

    new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
        self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
    )
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)

    # update frequency if not inferrable
    inferred_freq = self.inferred_freq
    freq = None if inferred_freq is None else self.freq
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

In the above code, the frequency is updated to None if it's not inferrable after localization.

With this fix, the `tz_localize` function will handle the frequency properly when localizing a timezone-naive index, ensuring that the frequency is updated as expected.
