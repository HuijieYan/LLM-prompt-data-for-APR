The error occurs when the `tz_localize` method is called with `nonexistent="shift_forward"` on a `DatetimeIndex` object `dti`. The test checks if the frequency of the result is `None`, but the actual frequency is `<Hour>`.

The bug occurs in the `tz_localize` method of the `DatetimeArray` class, particularly in the handling of the `nonexistent` parameter. The method fails to appropriately handle the `nonexistent="shift_forward"` argument and as a result, the frequency is not preserved as expected.

The approach to fixing this bug would involve modifying the logic in the `tz_localize` method to correctly handle the `nonexistent` parameter. The logic should adjust the frequency based on the value of `nonexistent` and ensure that the frequency is preserved when possible.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` method:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... (previous code)
    if nonexistent not in nonexistent_options and not isinstance(
        nonexistent, timedelta
    ):
        raise ValueError(
            "The nonexistent argument must be one of 'raise', "
            "'NaT', 'shift_forward', 'shift_backward' or "
            "a timedelta object"
        )

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
    
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    
    # Preserve freq if not modified
    freq = self.freq if nonexistent in ("shift_forward", "shift_backward") else None
    
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

In this corrected code, the frequency is preserved by storing the original frequency and returning it when `nonexistent` allows it. Otherwise, the frequency is set to `None` as required. This modification ensures that the `tz_localize` method appropriately handles the `nonexistent` parameter and preserves the frequency when possible.
