The issue is related to the `tz_localize` function not properly handling changes in frequency when localizing DatetimeIndex across a Daylight Saving Time transition. The function invalidates the frequency information of the index in such cases, causing inconsistencies.

The bug seems to be occurring within the `tz_localize` function, specifically in handling changes in frequency during DST transitions.

The bug is occurring because when localizing the DatetimeIndex to a new timezone, the `tz_localize` function does not properly handle changes in frequency, specifically when encountering Daylight Saving Time transitions. As a result, the frequency information of the index becomes inconsistent, leading to the failing assertion in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `tz_localize` function needs to properly handle changes in frequency during Daylight Saving Time transitions. The function should check the inconsistencies in frequency and adjust it, for example by setting it to None, when encountering DST switches. This will ensure that the frequency information remains consistent after localization.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # existing code ...

    if self.freq is not None:
        if tz is not None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
            new_freq = None  # Set frequency to None after localization
        else:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
            new_freq = self.freq
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC with adjusted frequency
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
        new_freq = self.inferred_freq  # Use inferred frequency

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=new_freq)
```

In this correction, the function properly handles changes in frequency during Daylight Saving Time transitions. When encountering such transitions, it adjusts the frequency information accordingly, ensuring that it remains consistent after localization.
