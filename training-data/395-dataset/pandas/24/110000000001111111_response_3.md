The error is likely caused by the `tz_localize` function failing to update the frequency of the index after localizing the time zone to `None`. This inconsistency is observed when there is a switch in the Daylight Saving Time.

To fix this issue, the `tz_localize` function should check if the frequency is still consistent with the new localized index and update it accordingly. If the frequency is not inferrable, it should be set to None.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    """
    Localize tz-naive Datetime Array/Index to tz-aware
    Datetime Array/Index.
    ...
    """

    nonexistent_options = ("raise", "NaT", "shift_forward", "shift_backward")
    if nonexistent not in nonexistent_options and not isinstance(nonexistent, timedelta):
        raise ValueError(
            "The nonexistent argument must be one of 'raise', 'NaT', "
            "'shift_forward', 'shift_backward' or a timedelta object"
        )

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
            # Update frequency after setting timezone to None
        self.freq = None
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    # Set the frequency to None if not inferrable
    if pd.infer_freq(new_dates) is None:
        self.freq = None
    else:
        self.freq = pd.infer_freq(new_dates)

    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=self.freq)
```

In this corrected code, after setting the timezone to None, the frequency of the index is updated based on the inferred frequency of the new dates. If the frequency is not inferrable, it is set to None.
