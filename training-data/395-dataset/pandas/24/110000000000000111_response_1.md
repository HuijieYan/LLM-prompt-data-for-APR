The test case provided demonstrates that when using the `tz_localize(None)` method, the resulting index still retains its frequency, which is not the expected behavior. The frequency should become None when time is localized to remove the time zone information.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block of code that handles the tz-naive case (`self.tz is None`). 

The bug occurs because the code does not check if the frequency is still consistent with the new localized index when using `tz_localize(None)`. In the case of Daylight Saving Time switch, the frequency of the index should become None since duplicated/missing timestamps are created. 

To fix the bug, the code should check for the consistency of the frequency after localizing to a time zone or removing the time zone information.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # existing code remains the same 

    new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
        self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
    )
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)

    # check if tz is None and set frequency to None if DST changes occur
    if tz is None:
        freq = getattr(self, 'inferred_freq', None)
        if freq is not None and freq in self.freq:
            self.freq = None

    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=self.freq)
```

With this correction, the frequency will be set to None if DST changes occur after localizing to remove the time zone information, as expected.
