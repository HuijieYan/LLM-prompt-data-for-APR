The error is occurring at the line `assert result.freq is None` in the `test_tz_localize_invalidates_freq` test function. This indicates that after localizing the timezone to "US/Eastern" with `nonexistent="shift_forward"`, the frequency of the result is not being set to None as expected.

Upon analyzing the problematic function `tz_localize`, it seems that the issue might be related to how the `nonexistent` parameter is being handled. The `tz_localize` function might not be setting the frequency to None when `nonexistent="shift_forward"` is used.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the frequency is set to None when `nonexistent` parameter is specified. Additionally, a review of the `tz_localize` function's logic around how it handles `nonexistent` parameter may help in identifying any other potential sources of the bug.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # Existing code remains unchanged

    if nonexistent not in ("raise", "NaT", "shift_forward", "shift_backward"):
        raise ValueError(
            "The nonexistent argument must be one of 'raise', "
            "'NaT', 'shift_forward', 'shift_backward'"
        )

    # Existing code remains unchanged

    new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
        self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
    )
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)

    if nonexistent in ("shift_forward", "shift_backward"):
        return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=None)
    else:
        return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=self.freq)
```

In the corrected code, after localizing the timezone, if `nonexistent` is specified as either "shift_forward" or "shift_backward", the frequency of the result is set to None explicitly. This should address the frequency-related issue encountered in the test case.
