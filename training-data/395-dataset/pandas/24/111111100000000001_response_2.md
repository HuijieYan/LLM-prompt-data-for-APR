The potential error in the problematic function `tz_localize` is in the conditional statement `if self.tz is not None:`. This condition is checking if the datetime array/index is already time zone aware, and if yes, it tries to convert the array/index to another time zone. However, the subsequent code does not handle this scenario correctly and might result in incorrect behavior.

The bug occurs because the method `tz_localize` is trying to convert a time zone aware datetime array/index to another time zone without first converting it to a naive datetime array/index. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the conversions.

To fix this bug, the `tz_localize` method should first check if the datetime array/index is already time zone aware and if so, convert it to naive datetime array/index before performing the requested time zone localization.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `tz_localize`:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:  # Removing the time zone information while keeping the local time
            new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_naive(self.asi8, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=self.freq)
```
