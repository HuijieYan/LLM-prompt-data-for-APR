This bug occurs because the `tz_localize` function is not correctly preserving the frequency in ambiguous cases. In the test case, when the timezone is set to "US/Eastern" and `nonexistent` is set to "shift_forward", the asserted frequency is `None`, but it should be "H".

The bug is most likely located within the `tz_localize` function, possibly in the logic that checks for ambiguous cases and handles the frequency preservation.

To fix this bug, the `tz_localize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the preservation of frequency in ambiguous cases. This may involve adjusting the logic for handling ambiguous and nonexistent times to ensure that the frequency is preserved when appropriate.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # existing code ...

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
        if self.freq is not None:
            return new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE).asfreq(self.freq)
    return new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
```
In the corrected function, after localizing the timestamps, it checks if the frequency (`self.freq`) is not None and uses the `asfreq` method to preserve the frequency before returning the result. This ensures that the frequency is preserved when appropriate.
