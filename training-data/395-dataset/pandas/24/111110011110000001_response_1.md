The error message is indicating that the frequency of the result after localizing to "US/Eastern" timezone with non-existent times shifted forward is not being handled correctly. The result is expected to have no frequency (`None`) due to the shift in time, but the assertion is failing, suggesting that the frequency is still present.

The potential error location within the `tz_localize` method is likely related to handling the frequency when there are non-existent times due to a shift of time, as specified by the `nonexistent="shift_forward"` parameter.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the scenario of non-existent times caused by the shift forward properly, resulting in the incorrect preservation of the frequency in the localized result.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle the scenario of non-existent times when shifting forward during localization.

The corrected code for the problematic function `tz_localize` is as follows:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # Existing code omitted for conciseness

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
        if ambiguous in (True, False) and nonexistent == "shift_forward":
            # When shifting forward with non-existent times, frequency should be None.
            freq = None
        else:
            freq = self.freq

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz) if tz else DT64NS_DTYPE
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

In the corrected code, a condition has been added to handle the scenario of shifting non-existent times forward. If the `ambiguous` parameter signifies explicit handling of ambiguous times (True/False) and the `nonexistent` parameter is set to "shift_forward", the frequency of the result is set to `None`. Otherwise, the frequency is preserved based on the original frequency of the localized dates.
