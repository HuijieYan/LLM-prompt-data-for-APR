The error occurs in the `tz_localize` function, specifically in the part where it sets the frequency after localizing the index to None. The frequency should be set to None if the timestamps are duplicated or missing due to Daylight Saving Time switch.

The bug occurs because the function does not check if the frequency is still consistent with the new localized index. In the case of Daylight Saving Time switch, the frequency of the index should become None (since duplicated/missing timestamps are created).

To fix the bug, we can modify the `tz_localize` function to check if the frequency is consistent with the new localized index and set it to None if it's not. Additionally, the frequency can be set to None if it's not inferrable.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
        self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
    )
    
    # Check if the frequency is consistent with the new localized index
    if self.freq != new_dates.freq:
        new_dates.freq = None
    
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=None)
```

With these changes, the `tz_localize` function will now correctly set the frequency to None if it's not consistent with the new localized index. This should resolve the issue where the frequency remains unchanged after localizing the index to None.
