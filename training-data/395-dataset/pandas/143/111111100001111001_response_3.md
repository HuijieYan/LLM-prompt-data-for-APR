The buggy function `get_indexer` is from the class `RangeIndex` in the file `/Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_143/pandas/core/indexes/range.py`. This function is intended to return an indexer for the given target, method, limit, and tolerance.

Upon analyzing the function and given test cases, the bug stems from the conditional check `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))`. This condition wrongly handles the case where both `method` and `tolerance` are not None but `target` is not list-like, resulting in an inappropriate behavior.

To fix this bug, it is more suitable to use a different condition to ascertain whether `method` and `tolerance` are both None or if `target` is list-like. This can allow for more accurate handling of the input parameters and provide the expected output.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_list_like

# ...

@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if not (method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target)):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected code, the condition for checking `method`, `tolerance`, and `target` has been revised to ensure that all cases are handled appropriately. This should resolve the issues observed in the buggy function.
