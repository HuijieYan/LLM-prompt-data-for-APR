The bug seems to be related to the `get_indexer` method in the pandas library, which is used in the `reindex` method. The bug results in the `limit` parameter not being applied as expected when using the `ffill` method.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` method is the condition check:
```python
if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)):
```
This condition seems to be incorrectly checking for the method and tolerance being None, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the condition is not correctly checking for the method and tolerance being None, which could lead to the incorrect execution of the subsequent code blocks. This can result in unexpected behavior when using the `reindex` method with the `limit` and `ffill` parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check and ensure that it correctly handles the method and tolerance parameters, as well as the target being list-like. We also need to ensure that the subsequent code blocks are executed correctly based on the condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code ensures that the condition check for the method, tolerance, and target is correct, and the subsequent code blocks are executed accordingly. This should address the bug related to the `reindex` method not following the limit parameter.
