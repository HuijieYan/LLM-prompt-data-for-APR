The buggy function `get_indexer` seems to have an issue with the conditional logic and input type validation. The function is intended to return the index of the target values.

The condition `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))` seems to be incorrect. It should be checking if `method` and `tolerance` are not None and `target` is list-like instead.

Based on the expected input and the error message, the issue may be related to the conditional logic, which incorrectly uses `not` and does not account for the expected types of the parameters.

To fix this, you can modify the conditional statement to correctly check for the expected conditions.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step
    
    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
