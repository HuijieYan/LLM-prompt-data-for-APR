The given function `get_indexer` has a bug that causes it to return incorrect values for the input parameters. The issue arises due to how the conditions are structured and the incorrect use of `is_list_like` function.

The bug occurs because the condition `not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))` is not effectively checking for both `method` and `tolerance` being `None`. Additionally, the use of `is_list_like(target)` is meant to identify if the `target` is list-like, but it does not effectively achieve this due to incorrect implementation.

To fix the bug, the condition needs to be restructured to accurately check for `method` and `tolerance` being `None`. Additionally, the check for list-like `target` should be directly performed on the `target` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making these changes, the `get_indexer` function should now correctly handle the input parameters and produce the expected results for the test cases provided.
