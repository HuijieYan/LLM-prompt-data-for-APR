The error occurs when the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class is called with the `method` parameter set to "pad" and the `limit` parameter set to 1. This method should return an indexer for non-monotonic indexers, but it is not producing the expected result in some cases.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the logic within the `get_indexer` method is not correctly handling the "pad" method and the `limit` parameter. It fails to properly take into account the limit when generating the indexer, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `get_indexer` method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the "pad" method and the `limit` parameter, ensuring that the appropriate values are returned as per the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# corrected method
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method == 'pad' and limit is not None:
        # Perform the pad operation with the given limit
        indexer = np.empty(len(target), dtype=np.intp)
        indexer.fill(-1)  # Initialize indexer with -1
        i = 0
        for value in target:
            while i < len(self) and value >= self[i]:
                indexer[i] = i
                i += 1
            i = max(0, i - limit)  # Apply the limit
        return indexer
    else:
        # Perform the default logic for other cases
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
```

By using this adjusted logic in the `get_indexer` method, the bug should be fixed, and the `get_indexer_limit` test case should pass without any errors.
