The error is occurring in the `get_indexer` function of the `RangeIndex` class. The function takes `target`, `method`, `limit`, and `tolerance` as input parameters. The bug seems to be related to the `if` condition at the beginning of the function, where it checks if `method` is None and `tolerance` is None, and if `target` is list-like. 

The condition `method is None and tolerance is None` is never met because `method` is always provided in the input parameters. Therefore, the function always ends up executing the `return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)` statement.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to check if `limit` is None instead of `tolerance`. Additionally, we need to consider other aspects such as the step value as it is used in the subsequent calculations.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function of the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if limit is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with the `if` condition and considers the `limit` parameter for determining the execution flow within the function.
