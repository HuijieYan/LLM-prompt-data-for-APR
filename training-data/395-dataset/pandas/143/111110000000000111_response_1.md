The bug seems to be related to the `get_indexer` function in the `RangeIndex` class, which is used when reindexing a DataFrame with the `method` and `limit` parameters.

The bug seems to be occurring in the conditional check:
```python
if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)):
```
This condition checks if `method` is None, `tolerance` is None, and `target` is list-like. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns the result of `super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)`. However, the intention seems to be to return `super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)` instead.

To fix this issue, you should modify the above condition to check for `limit` instead of `tolerance`. Additionally, ensure that the correct reindexing behavior is maintained.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if not (method is None and limit is None and is_list_like(target)):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
In this corrected code:
- The condition now checks for `limit` instead of `tolerance`.
- The call to `super().get_indexer` includes both `method` and `limit` parameters, ensuring that the reindexing behavior is properly handled.

With these changes, the bug related to the incorrect behavior of the `limit` parameter in DataFrame reindexing should be resolved.
