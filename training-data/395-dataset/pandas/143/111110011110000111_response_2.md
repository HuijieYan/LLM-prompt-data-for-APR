The error messages indicate that the problem comes from the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The method is not correctly handling the 'limit' parameter.

The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` method does not correctly implement the 'limit' parameter. When the 'limit' parameter is set, it is supposed to limit the data from being filled beyond a certain point in the reindexing process. However, the code does not handle this correctly and as a result, the tests fail, and the reindexing operation is not limited as expected.

To fix the bug, the code for the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the 'limit' parameter.

Here's the corrected `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if limit is not None:
        values = self.values
        indexer[indexer > limit] = -1
        for i in range(len(indexer) - 2, -1, -1):
            if indexer[i] == -1:
                break
            limit -= 1
            if limit < 0:
                indexer[i] = -1

    return indexer
```

This correction addresses the handling of the 'limit' parameter by correctly updating the indexer to limit the reindexing process as per the specified limit. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the `get_indexer` method behaves as expected, resolving the test failures and the issue reported.
