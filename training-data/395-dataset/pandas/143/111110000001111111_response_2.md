The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The method is designed to return index labels for the target array, based on the method and limit parameters. However, due to a conditional check `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))`, the method and limit parameters are not being used as intended.

The bug occurs because the conditional check is incorrectly structured. It should instead check if method is not None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target) to properly utilize the method and limit parameters.

To fix the bug, the conditional check in the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to properly use the method and limit parameters. Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code fixes the conditional check and properly utilizes the method and limit parameters, ensuring that the `get_indexer` method works as intended.
