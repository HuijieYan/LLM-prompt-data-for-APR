The buggy function `get_indexer` is not correctly handling the case where method and tolerance are not None, and the target is not a list-like object. The conditional check for this scenario is causing the function to return `super().get_indexer()` unconditionally. This causes the correct functionality for the RangeIndex not to be handled properly.

To fix this:
- We need to change the conditional check to properly handle the different scenarios based on the target, method, and tolerance.
- We should also ensure that the code to handle reversed ranges is working correctly.
- Additionally, we should handle the scenario where the target_array is not an integer dtype and has dimensions different from 1.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    if step < 0:
        start, stop = stop, start

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1:
        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)

    # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to the general method
    return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

The above fix addresses the incorrect handling of different scenarios based on the target, method, and tolerance. It also handles the case where target_array is not an integer dtype and has dimensions different from 1. With these changes, the `get_indexer` function should now work correctly for the given test cases.
