The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)):`. This condition is trying to check if method is None, tolerance is None, and target is a list-like object. However, the way it is currently written might not produce the expected result.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the condition is written in a way that might not accurately check if all three conditions are met. It's using `and` to check for three conditions, which might not give the intended logical evaluation.

To fix the bug, a better approach would be to check each condition separately and combine them using the `and` operator.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target):
        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1:
            locs = target_array - start
            valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
            locs[~valid] = -1
            locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

            if step != self.step:
                # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
                locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
            return ensure_platform_int(locs)

    return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In the corrected code, the conditions are checked separately and combined using the `and` operator, which provides the intended logical evaluation.
