The error occurs when calling the `reindex()` method on a DataFrame with the `method` parameter set to "ffill" and the `limit` parameter set to 1. This method call is expected to limit the forward fill operation to one backfilled value, but it doesn't behave as expected.

The error messages from the test functions indicate that the expected values for the reindexing operation are not correctly calculated, leading to incorrect behavior.

The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The bug is a result of incorrect conditional logic and improper handling of the `limit` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the `limit` parameter and ensure that it correctly limits the forward fill operation. Additionally, the conditional logic needs to be revised to accurately determine the operations based on the given parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method != "pad" or limit is None or not isinstance(target, RangeIndex):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    
    # Apply the limit to the forward fill operation
    locs[locs > limit] = -1

    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In this corrected code:
- The method now explicitly checks if the `method` parameter is "pad" and if the `limit` parameter is provided and is an integer, allowing for proper handling of the forward fill operation.
- The `limit` parameter is applied to limit the forward fill operation if the specified method is "pad".
- The conditional logic has been updated to correctly determine the operations based on the given parameters.

With this corrected code, the `get_indexer` method should now correctly handle the `limit` parameter and limit the forward fill operation as expected. This should address the issue observed in the test cases and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
