The error messages from the test functions indicate that there are differences in the values returned from the function being tested and the expected values. These differences are causing the tests to fail.

The `get_indexer` method is the one being called in both test functions. This method appears to implement a custom logic for returning the indexer for a given target range based on different criteria like step, start, stop, etc.

Upon reviewing the `get_indexer` method, it seems that the bug is related to the logic used to handle the range indices, especially when the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values are calculated.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the range indices needs to be reviewed and modified. The conditions for validating the target range and the calculations based on the step need to be adjusted to ensure the correct indexer is returned.

Here's the corrected `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = self.stop - 1, self.start - 1, -self.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

The change includes modifying the initial condition for `method` and `tolerance` checks, as well as updating the `if` condition for `step`. Additionally, integer division `//` is used instead of normal division `/` for calculations involving `locs[valid]`.
