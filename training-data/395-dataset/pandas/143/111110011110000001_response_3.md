The bug is occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The error messages from the test functions indicate that the expected and actual values are different, with a difference percentage of 16.66667%. This suggests that the bug is likely in the logic of the `get_indexer` method causing it to give incorrect results.

The faulty part of the `get_indexer` method is the condition checking `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))`. This condition seems to be preventing the correct execution of the subsequent code when it should not. This could be the reason for the incorrect results and the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we should consider the following approaches:
1. Carefully evaluate the boolean value of the condition `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))`. It might need to be revised to ensure that the subsequent code executes correctly when the condition is not met.
2. While calculating the `start`, `stop`, and `step`, ensure that the values are computed correctly based on the logic for handling a reversed range or setting `start`, `stop`, and `step` values when `self.step > 0`.
3. Validate the computation for `locs` and `valid` to correctly handle the indices in the `target_array`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    # Fixed condition to execute subsequent code
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step  # Changed division to integer division

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
