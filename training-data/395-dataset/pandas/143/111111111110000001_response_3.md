The error messages from the two test functions indicate that there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual results. This suggests that the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class may contain a bug.

The bug appears to occur in the `get_indexer` method when handling the `limit` parameter. This potentially leads to incorrect indexing of the target array resulting in mismatched expected and actual results.

To fix this bug, the `if` condition in the `get_indexer` method should be revised to correctly handle the `limit` parameter. Additionally, the logic for handling `limit` and `method` should be examined to ensure that the indexing is performed accurately.

Here's the corrected `get_indexer` method for the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
class RangeIndex(Int64Index):
    # ... other code ...

    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if limit is not None:  # Check if limit is provided
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected `get_indexer` method, if the `limit` parameter is provided, it returns the result from the superclass method with the `limit` parameter included. Otherwise, it proceeds with the existing logic for indexing the target array.

This correction should address the bug and ensure that the indexing is performed correctly, resolving the discrepancies observed in the test results.
