The buggy function is an overridden method `get_indexer` defined in the `RangeIndex` class. This method is intended to return index labels for the provided target values based on some internal logic related to the `start`, `stop`, and `step` attributes of the `RangeIndex` instance.

The bug arises from incorrect handling of the condition checks in the method. The method erroneously returns the result of `super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)` when one of the conditions is not met. This is likely not the intended behavior and results in unexpected output.

To fix this bug, the condition checks and logic for handling the target array need to be revised. The method should appropriately handle the provided target array based on the start, stop, and step attributes of the `RangeIndex` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    if step < 0:
        start, stop = stop, start
    
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    locs = (target_array - start) // step
    valid = (locs >= 0) & (locs < len(self))
    locs[~valid] = -1
    
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In this corrected code, the conditions are revised, and the logic for handling the target array and computing the index labels is appropriately adjusted based on the start, stop, and step attributes of the `RangeIndex` instance.
