The buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `RangeIndex` class. The error message from the test cases indicates that the indexing is not working correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The issue is likely in the logic of the `get_indexer` function for handling the `method="pad"` and `limit` parameters. When the method is "pad" and a limit is specified, the function should fill forward, imposing a limit on the number of consecutive NaNs to fill. However, the current implementation of the function does not handle this case correctly, resulting in incorrect results when using the "pad" method with a limit.

To fix this issue, the logic for handling the "pad" method with a limit needs to be revised to correctly apply the limit for forward filling. This may involve adjusting the indexers and the application of the limit for filling forward with padding.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
# this is the corrected get_indexer function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method == "pad" and limit is not None:
        # Apply forward fill with a limit
        indexer = self.get_indexer(target, method="pad", tolerance=tolerance)
        
        # Modify the indexer to apply the limit
        count = 0
        for i, val in enumerate(indexer):
            if val == -1:  # Indicates a NaN
                count += 1
                if count > limit:
                    indexer[i] = -1  # Exceeds the limit, set as NaN
            else:
                count = 0  # Reset consecutive NaNs count
        
        return indexer
    else:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In this corrected implementation, when the method is "pad" and a limit is specified, the forward filling is applied, and the limit is enforced on consecutive NaNs. This should address the issues observed in the test cases and prevent the incorrect results previously obtained.
