The test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` creates a DataFrame with a single column consisting of datetime values. The `quantile` method is then called with `q=0.5`, which results in a `ValueError` with the message "need at least one array to concatenate". This error occurs because the `quantile` method internally attempts to concatenate the data, and when all the columns are dropped by `_get_numeric_data` due to the absence of numerical columns, an empty DataFrame without any arrays is left. 

The error is likely to occur in the section of the `quantile` method where it processes the data and attempts to concatenate the values from blocks.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` method needs to handle the case where all the columns are dropped, resulting in an empty DataFrame. In this situation, the method should return an empty Series or DataFrame based on the input.

The corrected `quantile` method is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return self._constructor(data=None, index=q, columns=self.columns).rename_axis(index=0)
        else:
            return pd.Series([], name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

With this correction, the `quantile` method now checks if the DataFrame is empty after obtaining the numeric data. If it is empty, it returns an empty Series when `q` is a float, or an empty DataFrame with appropriate index and columns when `q` is an array. This prevents the ValueError that was previously occurring when all columns are dropped.
