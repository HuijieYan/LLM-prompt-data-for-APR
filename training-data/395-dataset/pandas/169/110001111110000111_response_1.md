The test case creates a DataFrame from a date range and then tries to calculate the quantile, which eventually leads to a ValueError due to an attempt to concatenate empty arrays.

The issue seems to lie in the `quantile` function in the DataFrame class, particularly in the line where it calls `data._data.quantile`. The method then tries to concatenate the results of the quantile computation, but it ends up with empty arrays, causing the ValueError.

The reason for the bug is that the `quantile` method does not handle datetime data correctly. It should be able to compute the quantile of datetime and timedelta data, as mentioned in the function's documentation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `quantile` method properly handles datetime and timedelta data by allowing for the computation of quantiles for these types of data. This can be achieved by modifying the code to handle datetime and timedelta data correctly and avoid empty arrays during the computation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation='linear'):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    # Updated code to handle datetime and timedelta data
    if issubclass(data.dtypes[0].type, (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
        result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed, numeric_only=numeric_only)
    else:
        result = data._data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

This corrected code includes handling the computation of quantiles for datetime and timedelta data by checking the dtype of the data. If the data is of datetime or timedelta type, it ensures that the quantile computation considers this data type and avoids the ValueError caused by empty arrays.
