The issue is occurring when calling the `quantile` method on a DataFrame that contains datetime data. The error message indicates that there is a problem with concatenation and the need for at least one array to concatenate.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function, it seems that the bug might be related to the `data` variable, which is supposed to contain the numeric data for computation. In cases where the DataFrame contains only datetime data, the `data` variable is empty. This leads to issues in the subsequent operations, such as concatenation.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to check if the `data` DataFrame is empty and handle this case separately. If the DataFrame contains only non-numeric data (like datetime), the function should return an empty Series or DataFrame, similar to how it behaves for empty input.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # existing code

    # Check if the DataFrame contains only non-numeric data
    if data.empty:
        if isinstance(q, float):  # In case q is a float
            result = pd.Series([], index=self.columns, name=q)
        else:  # In case q is an array-like
            result = pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=self.columns)
        result.columns.name = self.columns.name
    else:
        # Perform the quantile computation as before
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected code, when the `data` DataFrame is empty, an empty Series or DataFrame is returned based on the type of `q` (float or array-like).

By handling the edge case of an empty `data` DataFrame, the fixed function should now be able to handle scenarios where the input DataFrame contains only non-numeric data, such as datetime values.
