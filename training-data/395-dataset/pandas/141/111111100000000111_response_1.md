Analysis:
The bug occurs when the RangeIndex is decreasing and not in its canonical form. The start, stop, and step values are not correctly computed in this case, leading to incorrect values being returned by the get_indexer method. The bug results in the method indicating that all of its own values are missing and finding matches for values not included in the index.

Error Location:
The error occurs in the get_indexer method of the RangeIndex class, specifically in the code that determines the start, stop, and step values when dealing with decreasing RangeIndex.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The code in the get_indexer method incorrectly assumes that self.stop is the canonical form for a decreasing RangeIndex. This assumption leads to incorrect computation of start, stop, and step values when the RangeIndex is not in its canonical form.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the code should be modified to directly compute the reversed values from the underlying RangeIndex object rather than assuming self.stop is the canonical form for a decreasing RangeIndex.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected get_indexer method
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
