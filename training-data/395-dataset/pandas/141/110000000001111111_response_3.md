The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The issue arises when the RangeIndex is decreasing and not in its canonical form. When the step is larger than 1, uniqueness of representation with the stop value is lost.

The bug occurs because the code to determine start, stop, and step when dealing with a decreasing `RangeIndex` in `get_indexer` assumes that `self.stop` is the canonical form, which is not always the case.

To fix the bug, the start, stop, and step values should be calculated based on the reversed underlying range object, rather than assuming that `self.stop` is the canonical form.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code ensures that the start, stop, and step values are calculated correctly for both increasing and decreasing RangeIndex, regardless of whether the index is in its canonical form or not.
