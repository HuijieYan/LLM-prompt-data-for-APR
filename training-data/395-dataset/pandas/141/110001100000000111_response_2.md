The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of RangeIndex in the pandas library. This method is used to find matching indices for a given target, and the bug prevents this from working correctly for some cases, particularly when the RangeIndex is in decreasing order and not in its canonical form.

The reason for the bug is that the code to determine the start, stop, and step when dealing with decreasing RangeIndex in `get_indexer` assumes that `self.stop` is the canonical form, which is not always true. This assumption leads to incorrect results for some cases.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to simply take the values from the reversed underlying range object, rather than directly computing the reversed values ourselves. This can be achieved by using the `_range[::-1]` attribute to obtain the reversed range and then extracting the start, stop, and step values from it.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

The corrected code now handles decreasing RangeIndex in a manner that accounts for non-canonical forms and should now produce correct results for all cases.
