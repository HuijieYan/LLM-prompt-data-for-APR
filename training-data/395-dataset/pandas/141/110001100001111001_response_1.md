The buggy function `get_indexer` is designed to handle indexers for a range-based index. It seems to reverse the range and perform certain calculations based on the indices of the elements in the target array.

The potential error is in the calculation of `start`, `stop`, and `step` when the `self.step` is less than 0. More specifically, the reversal of the range might have resulted in incorrect start, stop, and step values which might impact the subsequent calculations.

The core issue is likely related to the logic used to handle negative step values when reversing the range. Additionally, the usage of variables such as `start`, `stop`, and `step` within the subsequent calculations should be handled carefully.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully determine the correct start, stop, and step values when the `self.step` is less than 0 and a range reversal is required. Additionally, the subsequent calculations involving these variables should be reviewed and modified as necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )
    
    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop + self.step, self.start - 1, -self.step)
    
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step
    
    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In this corrected code, the handling of negative `self.step` values and the reversal of the range have been updated to ensure that the start, stop, and step values are calculated effectively. Additionally, the subsequent calculations take into account the correct values of these variables.
