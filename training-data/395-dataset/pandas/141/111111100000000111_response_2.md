The test cases demonstrate that for some decreasing RangeIndex, the `get_indexer` method is incorrect and returns unexpected results. Specifically, it indicates that all of its own values are missing and finds matches for values not included in the index.

The issue arises when dealing with decreasing RangeIndex that are not in their canonical form. The code to determine start, stop, and step when dealing with a decreasing RangeIndex in the `get_indexer` method assumes `self.stop` is the canonical form. This assumption leads to incorrect reversed values being computed, resulting in faulty calculations.

To fix this bug, the reversed values should be taken from the reversed underlying range object instead of directly computing them ourselves.

The corrected code for the problematic function `get_indexer` is as follows:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
