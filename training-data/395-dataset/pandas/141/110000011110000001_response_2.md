The error message is indicating that the resulting array from the function `get_indexer` is different from the expected array, with 55.56% difference. This suggests an issue with the calculations and logic inside the `get_indexer` function.

The potential error location is the section where the `valid` indices are being calculated and modified. It seems that the logic for calculating `locs` and `valid` is incorrect.

The buggy function has a logical error in the calculation of `locs` and `valid` indices. As a result, the function is returning incorrect indices, leading to the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, the calculation of `locs` and `valid` indices should be reviewed and updated to ensure that the correct indices are returned. Additionally, the `if` conditions should be checked to handle all edge cases accurately.

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = (target_array - start) / step
    valid = (locs % 1 == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]

    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
