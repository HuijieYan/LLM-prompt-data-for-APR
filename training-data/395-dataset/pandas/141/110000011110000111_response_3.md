The test case `test_get_indexer_decreasing` is failing with an assertion error indicating that the left and right arrays of the `assert_numpy_array_equal` function are different. The expected and result arrays are not matching, leading to a failure in the test case.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` method is the calculation of `start`, `stop`, and `step` when the range is decreasing. This part of the code is responsible for determining the start, stop, and step values to process the range correctly.

The bug is occurring because the code to determine `start`, `stop`, and `step` when dealing with decreasing `RangeIndex` in `get_indexer` assumes `self.stop` is the canonical form. This assumption causes incorrect start, stop, and step values to be used in the subsequent calculations, leading to wrong results.

To fix the bug, the correct start, stop, and step values need to be obtained when the range is decreasing. Instead of directly computing the reversed values ourselves, we should take the values from the reversed underlying range object to ensure correctness.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Use the reversed underlying range object for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = self._range[::-1].start, self._range[::-1].stop, self._range[::-1].step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With this corrected code, the bug related to `RangeIndex.get_indexer` for some decreasing `RangeIndex` should be resolved.
