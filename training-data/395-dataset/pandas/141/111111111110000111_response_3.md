In the test case, the `test_get_indexer_decreasing` function is being used to test the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The test is intended to verify the behavior of the `get_indexer` method for a decreasing `RangeIndex` where the `stop` parameter is specified as 0, -1, or -2.

The error message indicates that the actual output from the `get_indexer` method does not match the expected output. Specifically, the numpy arrays for the actual and expected results are not equal. This suggests that the `get_indexer` method is not functioning as expected for decreasing `RangeIndex` instances.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional logic for handling the `step` in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The code that determines the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values when the `step` is greater than 0 or less than 0 could be causing the incorrect behavior for decreasing `RangeIndex` instances.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the `get_indexer` method does not correctly handle the case of decreasing `RangeIndex` instances. The conditional logic for handling the `step` value when it is less than 0 may not be accurately computing the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values for the reversed range.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for determining the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values when the `step` is less than 0 should be modified to accurately compute the reversed values. Instead of directly computing the reversed values, we should take the values from the reversed underlying range object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the `get_indexer` method behaves correctly for decreasing `RangeIndex` instances.
