The issue occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. When the step is negative, the code incorrectly calculates the start, stop, and step values, leading to incorrect indexing and causing the test cases to fail.

The potential error location is in the conditional block where the start, stop, and step values are reassigned based on whether the step is greater than 0. The issue arises from the incorrect computation of reversed values, which leads to unexpected results and assertion failures in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the reversed values should be obtained from the underlying range object instead of directly computing them. By using the reversed range directly, we can ensure that the start, stop, and step values are correctly determined for both increasing and decreasing ranges.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
class RangeIndex(Int64Index):
    # ... other methods ...

    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            reverse = self._range[::-1]
            start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

        if step != self.step:
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should now correctly handle both increasing and decreasing ranges without causing assertion failures in the test cases.
