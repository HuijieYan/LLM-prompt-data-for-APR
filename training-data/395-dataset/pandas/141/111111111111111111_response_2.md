The test function `test_get_indexer_decreasing` is parametrized for three different values of `stop`: 0, -1, and -2. The expected results of this test function are provided. However, the provided expected results do not match with the actual results, leading to an assertion error.

The issue occurs in the calculation of the `start`, `stop`, and `step` variables within the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. This occurs when dealing with a decreasing `RangeIndex` that is not in its canonical form. The code to determine `start`, `stop`, and `step` when dealing with a decreasing `RangeIndex` in `get_indexer` assumes that `self.stop` is the canonical form, leading to incorrect results when the index is not in its canonical form.

To fix this bug, the code should directly compute the reversed values by taking the values from the reversed underlying range object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method in the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
# ... (other code)

# this is the corrected get_indexer method
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

By directly computing the reversed values from the reversed underlying range object, the `get_indexer` method now correctly handles decreasing `RangeIndex` that are not in their canonical form.
