The buggy function is the `get_indexer` method in the `RangeIndex` class. This method is used to obtain the index labels for a target. However, it contains some conditional statements that could be leading to unexpected results.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly calculates the start, stop, and step values to perform the indexing. This results in incorrect index labels being returned.

To fix the bug, the function should calculate the start, stop, and step based on the properties of the `RangeIndex` object. It should also ensure that the calculations are correctly applied to the target array to obtain the index labels.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step

    if step > 0:
        start, stop = min(start, stop), max(start, stop)
    else:
        start, stop = max(start, stop), min(start, stop)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    locs = (target_array - start) // step
    valid = (target_array >= start) & (target_array < stop) & ((target_array - start) % step == 0)
    locs[~valid] = -1

    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
In the corrected code, start, stop, and step are calculated based on the properties of the `RangeIndex` object. The target array is then used to calculate the index labels. Finally, the function returns the index labels after ensuring their integer type.
