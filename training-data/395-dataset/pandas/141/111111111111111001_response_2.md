The error in the function is likely due to incorrect calculations regarding "start," "stop," and "step" variables that are used to compute the "locs" and "valid" arrays. Based on the provided values and types, it seems that the logic within the function is flawed, resulting in the incorrect computation of the aforementioned arrays.

The error is likely caused by incorrectly handling the "start," "stop," and "step" values and their usage in reverse range computation.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly compute the "start," "stop," and "step" values based on whether "step" is positive or negative. Additionally, the computation of "locs" and "valid" arrays based on the "step" value should be fixed to generate the correct output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        stop, start, step = self.start, self.stop, -self.step  # swap start and stop for reverse range computation

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = (target_array - start) // step
    valid = (target_array >= start) & (target_array < stop) & ((target_array - start) % step == 0)
    locs[~valid] = -1

    if step != self.step:
        # We are using the reversed range: transform locs back to original
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]

    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With the new implementation, the "start," "stop," and "step" values are handled correctly to compute the "locs" and "valid" arrays for the given input values. This should resolve the bug in the function.
