Potential Error Location:
The issue appears to be in the calculation of the `start`, `stop`, and `step` variables in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class in the pandas library. Specifically, the computation of these values when dealing with a decreasing `RangeIndex` is causing incorrect indexing results.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code to determine `start`, `stop`, and `step` when dealing with a decreasing `RangeIndex` assumes `self.stop` is in the canonical form. However, when the step is larger than 1, the uniqueness of representation with `stop` (i.e., `range(1, 6, 2)` being equal to `range(1, 7, 2)`) is lost, leading to incorrect calculations.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to directly compute the reversed values from the reversed underlying range object, rather than relying on the assumptions about the canonical form.

Corrected Code for the `get_indexer` Method:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    reverse = self._range[::-1]
    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
In this corrected code, the `start`, `stop`, and `step` variables are computed based on the `reverse` range object, which resolves the issue of incorrect indexing for decreasing `RangeIndex`.
