The error is likely occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The expected output seems to mismatch with the actual output. The function should return an index array that labels the index of the elements in the input `target` range.

The problem is likely occurring in the calculation of the `locs` array and the subsequent usage of that array to identify valid indices in the input range.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to carefully analyze the logic used to calculate the `locs` and `valid` arrays. The `locs` array should correctly reflect the index positions of the elements in the input range, and the `valid` array should correctly identify the valid indices. Based on the expected values, it seems that the indices of valid elements could be off by one or could be incorrectly assigned.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    locs = (target_array - self.start) // self.step
    valid = (locs >= 0) & (locs < len(self)) & ((locs * self.step + self.start) == target_array)

    return ensure_platform_int(np.where(valid, locs, -1))
```

In this corrected code, calculations for `locs` and `valid` are simplified to ensure correct indexing and validation of the target range. Additionally, the return statement is updated to use the `np.where` function to generate the final array containing valid indices for the elements in the target range.
