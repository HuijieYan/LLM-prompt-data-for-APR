The error is likely occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The issue is that when dealing with decreasing `RangeIndex` values, the method assumes that `self.stop` is in canonical form, which leads to incorrect behavior in some cases.

The bug occurs because the code to determine `start`, `stop`, `step` when dealing with decreasing `RangeIndex` in `get_indexer` assumes `self.stop` is the canonical form. This assumption causes the method to produce incorrect results, especially for decreasing `RangeIndex` that are not in their canonical form. 

To fix the bug, instead of directly computing the reversed values ourselves, it would be better to take the values from the reversed underlying range object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
