The bug is occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class for some specific scenarios where the stop value is not the next valid value in the range that's not included. This causes the method to indicate that its own values are missing and find matches for values not included in the index.

The error is likely occurring in the calculation of the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values when `self.step` is less than 0, as indicated by the error message and the issue description. The code directly computes the reversed values based on `self.start` and `self.stop`, assuming `self.stop` is the canonical form. This assumption is causing the incorrect behavior of the `get_indexer` method.

To fix this bug, the values for `start`, `stop`, and `step` should be obtained from the reversed underlying range object `self._range[::-1]` instead of directly computing the reversed values based on `self.start` and `self.stop`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

By obtaining the values for `start`, `stop`, and `step` from the reversed underlying range object, the `get_indexer` method should now work correctly for the specific scenarios where the bug was observed.
