The error message indicates that the arrays returned by the `get_indexer` method and the expected values are different. This suggests that the logic inside the `get_indexer` method is not producing the correct output.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` method is the calculations related to the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values. It seems that the logic to calculate the indices is not functioning as expected when the step is negative. This could be causing the incorrect output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the conditional statement that handles cases where the step is less than 0. It appears that the logic within this conditional block is causing the incorrect output. This could be due to incorrect indexing or calculation of the range when the step is negative.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case where the step is negative more accurately. This may involve modifying the calculations and transformations of the indices when the step is negative.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
            return super().get_indexer(
                target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
            )
    
        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = self.start - 1, self.stop - self.step, -self.step
    
        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step
    
        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the negative step is modified to ensure that the indices are calculated correctly. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the `get_indexer` method.
