The bug is occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. This method is designed to return an indexer that can be used to align the index values with the given target values. The bug occurs when the RangeIndex is decreasing and not in its canonical form, resulting in incorrect indexer values being returned.

The bug is caused by the code assuming that `self.stop` represents the canonical form of the range, which is not true for decreasing ranges with a step larger than 1.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to use the values from the reversed underlying range object when dealing with decreasing RangeIndex in the `get_indexer` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# this is the corrected get_indexer method
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Use the reversed range for simplicity
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

The corrected code now correctly handles the case of a decreasing RangeIndex that is not in its canonical form. It uses the values from the reversed underlying range object to calculate the start, stop, and step, ensuring that the `get_indexer` method returns the correct indexer values for all RangeIndex variations.
