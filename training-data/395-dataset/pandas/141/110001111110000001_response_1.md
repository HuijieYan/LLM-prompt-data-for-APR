The error arises from the fact that the 'result' variable is different from the 'expected' variable, causing the assertion error. This means that the 'get_indexer' function is not producing the expected results.

The issue lies in how the start, stop, and step values are being handled based on the value of 'self.step'. This affects the calculation of the 'locs' variable, which in turn leads to incorrect results.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to reconsider how the start, stop, and step values are handled, and how the 'locs' variable is calculated. There seems to be confusion in the treatment of reversed range and general range cases.

Here's the corrected code for the get_indexer function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if step < 0:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = stop - step, start + 1, -step

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step

    if step < 0:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With this corrected code, the 'get_indexer' function should produce the expected results, and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
