The issue is occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class in the file `pandas/core/indexes/range.py`. The purpose of this method is to return the indices of the elements from the 'target' array that are present in the index. It is mainly failing when dealing with decreasing `RangeIndex` that are not in their canonical form.

The root cause seems to be in the code that determines the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values when dealing with a decreasing `RangeIndex`. The code makes assumptions about the `start` and `stop` values, which are incorrect when the `RangeIndex` is not in its canonical form.

To address this issue, it is suggested that the reversed values should be computed from the underlying range object directly, rather than making assumptions based on the canonical form of the `RangeIndex`.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step
    
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step
    
    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

It's important to note that the key change is in how the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values are computed, specifically when `self.step` is less than 0. The corrected approach directly retrieves the reversed values from the underlying range object. This change should address the issues related to non-canonical forms of decreasing `RangeIndex`.
