The error is that when dealing with decreasing RangeIndex, the `get_indexer` method mistakenly assumes that `self.stop` is the canonical form. This causes it to indicate that all of its own values are missing and find matches for values not included in the index. The issue stems from the code attempting to determine the `start`, `stop`, and `step` when dealing with a decreasing RangeIndex within the `get_indexer` method.

To fix this bug, the correct approach would be to take the values from the reversed underlying range object, instead of directly computing the reversed values ourselves.

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` method is as follows:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Corrected calculation for reversed range
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

By making the suggested changes to the `get_indexer` method, the bug related to the issues with the `RangeIndex.get_indexer` should be resolved.
