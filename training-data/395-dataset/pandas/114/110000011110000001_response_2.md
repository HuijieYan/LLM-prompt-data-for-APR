The error occurred when trying to access elements of a DecimalArray using comparison operations such as `s[s > 0.5]`. The DecimalArray is not being appropriately handled within the `get_value` method of the Series index.

The potential error location within the `get_value` method is the section where it tries to retrieve values using `com.values_from_object(series)`. This can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with non-standard array types such as DecimalArray.

The bug occurred because the `get_value` method did not handle the DecimalArray appropriately. When trying to perform comparison operations, the method was not able to correctly access the values from the DecimalArray.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the DecimalArray separately within the `get_value` method and ensure that its values are appropriately accessed.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    try:
        if hasattr(series, "loc"):
            return series.loc[key]
        is_integer = False
        if is_scalar(key):
            is_integer = is_integer(key)

        s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
        if isinstance(s, DecimalArray) and is_scalar(key):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                return s[loc]
            except KeyError:
                if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                    raise
                elif is_integer:
                    return s[key]
        elif isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
                return s[loc]
            except KeyError:
                if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                    raise
                elif is_integer:
                    return s[key]
    except Exception as e:
        raise e
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the series has a `loc` property, in which case we directly use `series.loc[key]` to retrieve the value. Then, we handle the DecimalArray separately and access values accordingly. Finally, we handle potential exceptions by re-raising them.
