The issue arises from the `get_value` method in the `pandas` library. It appears that the method `get_value` densifies the ExtensionArray when it filters a Series with a mask, which can be very expensive and cause performance issues.

The potential error location is within the block of code where the `s[s > 0.5]` operation is being performed. This is where the `get_value` method is being called to filter the Series with a mask.

The bug occurs because the `get_value` method unnecessarily densifies the ExtensionArray when performing filtering operations. This densification can be very expensive and is unnecessary for filtering operations.

To fix the bug, the `get_value` method should be modified to avoid densifying the ExtensionArray when performing operations like filtering Series with a mask.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):

    if isinstance(key, (bool, np.bool_)) or self.is_boolean():
        return self._engine.get_value(series._values, key)

    return self._engine.get_value(series._values, key, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))

```

In this corrected code, the `get_value` method checks if the key is a boolean type or if the index is boolean, and if so, it directly calls the `_engine.get_value` without densifying the ExtensionArray unnecessarily. If the condition is not met, the method proceeds to perform the regular indexing operation without densification.
