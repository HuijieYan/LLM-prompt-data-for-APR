The test case provided is attempting to create a pandas Series with a DecimalArray and filter the series with a mask. This operation should not materialize the ExtensionArray unnecessarily, but it currently seems to be doing so. The error message indicates that an attempt is made to convert a DecimalArray to a numpy array, which is not desired behavior.

The potential error location within the `get_value` method of the `Index` class in the `pandas/core/indexes/base.py` file. More specifically, the conversion from an ExtensionArray to a materialized numpy array seems to occur in the `get_value` method.

The bug occurs because the `get_value` method is not handling the ExtensionArray appropriately and is converting it to a numpy array unnecessarily.

To fix the bug, the `get_value` method should be modified to handle ExtensionArray appropriately and not convert it to a numpy array unnecessarily.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return s[iloc]

    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
```

This corrected code ensures that the `get_value` method doesn't unnecessarily convert the ExtensionArray to a numpy array and handles it appropriately.
