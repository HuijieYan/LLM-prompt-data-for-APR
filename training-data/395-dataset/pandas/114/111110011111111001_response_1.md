The test case "test_indexing_no_materialize" is using a pandas Series of DecimalArray and performing indexing operations on it. The error message indicates that an attempt is being made to convert a DecimalArray to a numpy array, which is not allowed.

The potential error location is the "get_value" function in the Index class. The code within this function is attempting to convert the DecimalArray to a numpy array, which is not allowed based on the error message.

The bug occurred because the "get_value" function is not handling DecimalArray objects properly and is trying to convert them to a numpy array, which is not supported.

To fix the bug, the "get_value" function should explicitly handle DecimalArray objects and avoid converting them to numpy arrays.

Below is the corrected code for the "get_value" function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    if isinstance(series, pd.Series) and isinstance(series.array, DecimalArray):
        if isinstance(key, int):
            return series.array[key]
        else:
            return series.array[list(key)]
    else:
        return super(Index, self).get_value(series, key)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the input series is a pandas Series and its underlying array is a DecimalArray. If it is, we handle the indexing operation directly with the DecimalArray without attempting to convert it to a numpy array. Otherwise, we fall back to the original behavior of the function.
