This code defines the `get_value` method for the `Index` class. This method is used to retrieve the value at a specific index location within the index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of index location 'key'. The code attempts to convert the key to a location and then retrieve the corresponding value. However, the error handling and value retrieval logic seems to be convoluted and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

The reasons behind the bug could be improper handling of exceptions, incorrect key conversion, and ambiguous treatment of different types of keys.

To fix the bug, the code should be refactored to have clear and concise logic for handling key retrieval and value extraction. Proper error messages or handling should also be implemented to make it easier to debug issues related to key retrieval and value extraction.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return s[key]
    
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(key, kind="getitem")

    try:
        return s[k]
    except (KeyError, IndexError):
        raise KeyError(key)
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling different types of keys and retrieving values is simplified and made more clear. Proper error handling is also implemented to raise meaningful exceptions when key retrieval fails.
