Upon analysis of the test case and error message, it is evident that the error occurs when attempting to filter a series with a mask, leading to materializing the ExtensionArray. This is not desirable, especially if the ExtensionArray doesn't store a numpy array of scalars.

The bug is likely located in the `Index` class method `get_value` since it is responsible for converting the ExtensionArray to a materialized numpy array.

The bug occurs because the `get_value` method first tries to call `values_from_object(series)` which indirectly leads to a numpy array materialization, and this is not desirable for ExtensionArrays.

To fix the bug, the `get_value` function needs to be modified to avoid unnecessary materialization of the ExtensionArray.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    if isinstance(series, ExtensionArray) and is_scalar(key):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return series[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return series[key]

    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")

    try:
        # as_indexer
        loc = np.where(self == key)[0]
        if len(loc) > 0:
            return series[loc[0]]
    except TypeError:
        pass

    return self._engine.get_value(series, k)
```

The modification made in the corrected code is to directly check if the `series` is an `ExtensionArray` and then implement a different logic to handle the scenario, avoiding unnecessary materialization of the ExtensionArray.
