The potential error in the provided code is that the `get_value` function is being defined twice, which is not allowed in Python. This will result in a syntax error.

To fix this issue, one of the `get_value` functions should be removed or renamed.

One approach to fixing this bug is to rename one of the `get_value` functions to a different name, or remove it if it is redundant.

Corrected code:
