The issue reported on GitHub is related to the __getitem__ method of DataFrame/Series with ExtensionArray densifying the array. The problem arises when trying to access elements (indexing) of a DataFrame or Series with a mask, causing the ExtensionArray to be converted to a materialized numpy array, which can be very expensive, especially if the ExtensionArray doesn't store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

The __getitem__ method is a part of the Python data model and it's used to implement the behavior of the [] operator. In this case, when using the [] operator with a mask, it triggers a call to Index.get_value method, which eventually leads to the densification of ExtensionArray.

To fix this bug, the __getitem__ method should be modified in a way that it doesn't trigger the densification of ExtensionArray. This can possibly be achieved by handling the behavior of [] operator more efficiently, specifically when used with ExtensionArray.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function (Index.get_value method):

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series) if hasattr(series, "_values") else series
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        if self._can_fast_get_values():
            return self._fast_get_values(s, key)
    # ... omitted code ...
    return s
```
In this corrected code, I added a check for self._can_fast_get_values() before proceeding with the rest of the code. If this condition is met, it will call self._fast_get_values to get the value, without triggering the unwanted densification of ExtensionArray. If the condition is not met, the code will proceed with the rest of its logic.
