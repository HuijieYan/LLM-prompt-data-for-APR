The bug seems to be related to the `get_value` method in the `pandas.core.indexes.base` file. The issue occurs when filtering a series with a mask that densifies the ExtensionArray, which can potentially be very expensive if the ExtensionArray doesn't store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

The code first tries index.get_value() in `__getitem__` before doing anything else and inside Index.get_value, it is calling `values_from_object`. This seems to be causing the densification of the ExtensionArray.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `get_value` method to avoid densifying the ExtensionArray. This may involve updating the way indexing is performed in the `get_value` method to prevent unwanted densification.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # Use values attribute directly to avoid densifying ExtensionArray
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        # First try to convert the key to a location
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except (IndexError, KeyError):
            if is_integer(key) and len(self) > 0:
                return s[key]

    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")

    return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
```

In the corrected code, we use the `values` attribute directly to avoid the unintentional densification of the ExtensionArray. This should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
