The error indicated in the GitHub issue is related to the fact that filtering a series with a mask "densifies" the ExtensionArray, potentially leading to a materialized numpy array, which can be very expensive.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_value` method of the Index class in the `pandas/core/indexes/base.py` file. Specifically, the code `iloc = self.get_loc(key)` may be causing the densification of the ExtensionArray, leading to the issue described in the GitHub post.

The bug occurs because the `get_value` method is directly converting the ExtensionArray to a materialized numpy array before performing any check on whether it is necessary.

To fix this bug, it is suggested to modify the `get_value` method to avoid directly converting the ExtensionArray to a materialized numpy array. Instead, the method should first check if densification is necessary based on the key and the type of array being operated on.

The corrected code for the problematic `get_value` method is as follows:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # ... (existing code) ...
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        # First try to convert the key to a location
        # If that fails, raise a KeyError if an integer
        # index, otherwise, see if key is an integer, and
        # try that
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return s[key]
    # ... (remaining code) ...
```

With this modification, the `get_value` method first checks for the necessity of densification based on the key and handles the array accordingly, addressing the densification issue described in the GitHub issue.
