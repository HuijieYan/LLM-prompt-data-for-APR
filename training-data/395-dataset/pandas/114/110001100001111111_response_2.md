It seems that the issue arises from the `Index.get_value` method, which is calling `values_from_object` to convert the `series` and `key` parameters into objects.

The error message indicates that the ExtensionArray is being densified (converted to a materialized numpy array), which can be very expensive. This is problematic as it defeats the purpose of using ExtensionArray, especially if it doesn't store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

To fix this issue, the `Index.get_value` method should be modified to handle ExtensionArray efficiently without densifying it unnecessarily. One possible approach is to check the type of the `series` parameter and handle ExtensionArray differently to avoid densification.

Here's the corrected code for the `Index.get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # handle ExtensionArray differently to avoid densification
    if isinstance(series, ExtensionArray):
        try:
            return series[key]
        except KeyError as e:
            raise e
    
    # for other types, convert series and key to objects
    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except KeyError as e1:
        if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
            raise
    
        try:
            return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
        except IndexError:
            raise
        except TypeError:
            # generator/iterator-like
            if is_iterator(key):
                raise InvalidIndexError(key)
            else:
                raise e1
        except Exception:
            raise e1
    except TypeError:
        # e.g. "[False] is an invalid key"
        if is_scalar(key):
            raise IndexError(key)
        raise InvalidIndexError(key)
```

In this corrected code, we handle ExtensionArray differently by directly accessing its elements without densifying it. For other types, the previous logic for converting series and key to objects is retained. This should prevent the unnecessary densification of ExtensionArray and improve its efficiency in the `Index.get_value` method.
