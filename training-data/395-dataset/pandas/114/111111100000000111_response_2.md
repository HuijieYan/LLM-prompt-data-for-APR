The test case provided with the error message indicates that when filtering a Series with a mask, the ExtensionArray is being densified, potentially resulting in the conversion of the ExtensionArray to a materialized numpy array. This conversion can be very expensive, especially if the ExtensionArray does not store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

The error location within the `get_value` function is likely the conversion of the Series to a numpy array using `com.values_from_object(series)`.

The bug occurs because the `get_value` function uses `com.values_from_object(series)` to convert the Series to a numpy array, which densifies the ExtensionArray. This conversion to a numpy array of the Series introduces the expensive operation, leading to the potential performance issue.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to avoid the unnecessary conversion of the Series to a numpy array within the `get_value` function. Instead, directly operate on the ExtensionArray without densifying it unnecessarily.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_value` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # if we have something that is Index-like, then
    # use this, e.g. DatetimeIndex
    # Things like `Series._get_value` (via .at) pass the EA directly here.
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        # GH 20882, 21257
        # Unify Index and ExtensionArray treatment
        # First try to convert the key to a location
        # If that fails, raise a KeyError if an integer
        # index, otherwise, see if key is an integer, and
        # try that
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return s[key]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged.
    # ...
```
In the corrected code, the unnecessary conversion of the Series to a numpy array has been removed, and the function now directly operates on the ExtensionArray without densifying it. This should prevent the expensive operation and resolve the potential performance issue.
