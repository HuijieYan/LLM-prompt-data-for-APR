Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring within the `get_value` method of the DataFrame/Series class in pandas.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `get_value` method first tries to call `index.get_value(self, key)` before performing any checks, which leads to unnecessary densification of the ExtensionArray when filtering a series with a mask. This behavior is problematic and can potentially be very expensive.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the `get_value` method to avoid unnecessary densification of the ExtensionArray. This may involve restructuring the code to perform the necessary checks before calling `index.get_value(self, key)` or finding an alternative approach to handling the indexing operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_value(self, key, tz=None):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value within an Series at passed key
    Parameters
    ----------
    key : label
    Returns
    -------
    value : scalar
    Raises
    ------
    KeyError : if the key is not in the index
    """
    if com.is_iterator(key):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with an iterable is not supported")

    if com.is_scalar(key):
        # a scalar
        key = com.cast_scalar_indexer(key)

    return self._engine.get_value(self, key, tz=tz)
```
This corrected implementation avoids unnecessary densification of the ExtensionArray by directly calling `self._engine.get_value` after performing the necessary type checks.
