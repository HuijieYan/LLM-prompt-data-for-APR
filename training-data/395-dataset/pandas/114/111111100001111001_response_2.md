Potential error location: The error is occurring within the `get_value` method of the `Index` class.

Reasons for the bug:
1. It seems that the function first checks if the series is an ExtensionArray or Index and then tries to convert the key to a location using `get_loc(key)`.
2. If that fails, it checks if the key is an integer and tries to access it directly from the series.
3. There are also some error handling mechanisms and checks for types and lengths of the index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the key is an integer before trying to use it as a location.
2. Handle the error cases properly and provide clear error messages if the key is invalid.
3. Simplify the code to make it more readable and understandable.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except (KeyError, IndexError):
            pass
    try:
        k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._engine.get_value(series, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except Exception as e:
        if is_scalar(key):
            raise IndexError(f"Invalid index value: {key}") from e
        else:
            raise InvalidIndexError(key) from e
    return self._engine.get_value(series, key, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
```

This corrected code simplifies the error handling and avoids unnecessary error checks. It first attempts to get the value using `get_loc` and if that fails, it converts the key and tries to get the value directly. If both approaches fail, it raises an appropriate error.
