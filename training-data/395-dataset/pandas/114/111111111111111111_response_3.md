The error occurs in the `get_value` method of the `Index` class, where the extension array is being converted to a numpy array unnecessarily.

The bug occurs because the `get_value` method calls `com.values_from_object(series)`, which in turn converts the extension array to a numpy array. This is not necessary and could lead to performance issues, especially if the extension array doesn't store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary conversion of the extension array to a numpy array needs to be avoided.

The corrected `get_value` method should be updated as follows:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    k = getattr(key, "_values", key)

    # Other code logic remains the same
    # ...
```

By using the `_values` attribute of both the `series` and `key` objects, it is possible to avoid converting the extension array to a numpy array unnecessarily. This change should resolve the issue of the extension array being densified when performing indexing operations.
