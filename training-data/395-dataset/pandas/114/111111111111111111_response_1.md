The provided error message indicates that the attempt to convert a DecimalArray to a numpy array raises an exception when the `__array__` method of the DecimalArray is called. This occurs specifically during the indexing operation `s[s > 0.5]`.

The bug is likely located within the `get_value` method of the Index class, as it utilizes the `com.values_from_object` function to convert the input series and key to an object representation. This conversion process may lead to the materialization (conversion to a numpy array) of the ExtensionArray unnecessarily, triggering the exception.

The occurrence of the bug is due to the implicit conversion of the ExtensionArray to a numpy array during the indexing operation, leading to an exception when the `__array__` method is called on the DecimalArray.

To fix this issue, a possible approach would be to modify the `get_value` method of the Index class to avoid unnecessary materialization of the ExtensionArray. This can be achieved by directly accessing the underlying values of the ExtensionArray without prompting its conversion to a numpy array.

Below is the corrected `get_value` method:

```python
# corrected get_value method
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # directly accessing the underlying values of the ExtensionArray
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    k = getattr(key, "_values", key)  # accessing the underlying values of the key

    # remaining code...
```

By directly accessing the `_values` attribute of the series and key, the unnecessary materialization of the ExtensionArray can be avoided, resolving the reported issue.
