The test case is trying to filter a series with a mask, but it's encountering an error when doing so, specifically when trying to obtain the value from the index in the `__getitem__` method. The error message indicates that it's trying to convert a `DecimalArray` to a numpy array.

The potential error location in the code is within the `get_value` method of the `Index` class, where it tries to call `com.values_from_object(series)` which may be causing the issue.

The error is likely occurring because the `com.values_from_object(series)` function is trying to convert the `DecimalArray` into a numpy array, which is causing the unexpected behavior. This is not desirable because the problem mentioned in the detailed issue description is that the ExtensionArray is getting densified unnecessarily, leading to potentially expensive operations. This is critical as the extension array might not store a numpy array of scalars under the hood, leading to resource-intensive conversions when not required.

To fix the bug, we should update the `get_value` method to avoid unnecessary conversion to a numpy array for the `DecimalArray`. Instead, it should directly handle the `DecimalArray` and return the required values without densifying the array unnecessarily.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
# corrected get_value method
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return s[key]

    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        return s[k]
    except IndexError:
        raise
    except TypeError:
        # generator/iterator-like
        if is_iterator(key):
            raise InvalidIndexError(key)
        else:
            raise
```

With this correction, the `com.values_from_object(series)` should not unnecessarily convert the `DecimalArray` to a numpy array, thereby avoiding the error message encountered in the test case.
