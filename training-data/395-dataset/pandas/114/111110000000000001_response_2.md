Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the `get_value` function within the `Index` class. 

Reasons behind the bug: The code seems to be trying to handle different types of input data (e.g., ExtensionArray, Index, integers, scalars) and is using multiple try-except blocks to handle errors. However, the handling of different types of input data and the corresponding error handling logic seems to be convoluted and may lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Simplify the logic by handling different types of input data separately without the need for multiple try-except blocks.
2. Clearly define the behavior for different types of input data and implement the error handling logic accordingly.

Corrected code for the `get_value` function:
```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return s[iloc]

    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
```
