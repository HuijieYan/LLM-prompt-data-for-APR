The test function is trying to index a Series `s` with a boolean condition `s > 0.5`. This is triggering the `get_value` method of the `pd.Series` class, which is causing an exception related to converting a `DecimalArray` to a numpy array.

The issue is occurring in the `get_value` method. It seems that the method is not handling the case of a `DecimalArray` being used as the series, which is causing the exception related to converting it to a numpy array.

To fix this issue, the `get_value` method should be modified to handle the case of a `DecimalArray` being passed in as the series parameter. The method should check the type of the series and handle the `DecimalArray` differently.

Here's the corrected `get_value` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        # Handle DecimalArray differently
        if isinstance(s, DecimalArray):
            return s[key]
        # Rest of the code remains the same...
```
