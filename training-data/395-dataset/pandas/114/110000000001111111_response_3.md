The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_value` method.

The issue with the current implementation is that it is converting ExtensionArray to a materialized numpy array when filtering a series with a mask, which can be very expensive. This behavior is not desired, and it is causing potential performance issues.

One approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `get_value` method to handle ExtensionArray more efficiently, such that it does not unnecessarily convert to a materialized numpy array.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)

    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return s[iloc]

    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")

    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except KeyError:
        return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
    except IndexError:
        raise
    except TypeError:
        if is_iterator(key):
            raise InvalidIndexError(key)
        else:
            raise IndexError(key)
    except Exception as e:
        raise e
```

This corrected code handles ExtensionArray in a more efficient way, especially when filtering a series with a mask. It avoids unnecessary materialization of the numpy array and should improve performance in such cases.
