The issue here is that when filtering a Series with a mask, the ExtensionArray is being converted to a materialized numpy array, which can be very expensive. This is causing performance issues, especially if the ExtensionArray doesn't store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_value` method of the `Index` class in the `pandas.core.indexes.base` module.

The bug occurs because the `get_value` method is not handling ExtensionArray efficiently, and is unnecessarily densifying the array, leading to performance issues.

To fix the bug, the `get_value` method can be modified to handle ExtensionArray more efficiently by avoiding the unnecessary densification of the array. Instead, it should directly access the values from the ExtensionArray and operate on them without densifying the array.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return s[iloc]
    
    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
```

In this corrected code, we are avoiding unnecessary densification of the ExtensionArray and directly accessing the values from the ExtensionArray when handling them in the `get_value` method. This should improve the performance and avoid the unnecessary conversion to a numpy array.
