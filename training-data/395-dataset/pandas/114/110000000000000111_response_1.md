Based on the detailed issue description, it seems that the problem arises from the `Index.get_value` method being called before doing anything else, and it may be calling `values_from_object`.

The potential error in the problematic function is likely in the `get_value` method, specifically where it calls `values_from_object` and tries to get the value from the series.

The bug occurs because the `Index.get_value` method is called before any other operations, and this method may convert ExtensionArray to a materialized numpy array, which can be expensive.

To fix this bug, one approach could be to modify the `get_value` method so that the ExtensionArray is not densified unnecessarily. This might involve restructuring the method to avoid the call to `values_from_object` or finding an alternative way to retrieve the value from the series.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    if isinstance(series, ExtensionArray):
        try:
            return series[key]
        except IndexError:
            raise KeyError(key)

    # Rest of the original code for handling non-ExtensionArray cases
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, Index) and is_scalar(key):
        # GH 20882, 21257
        # Unify Index and ExtensionArray treatment
        # First try to convert the key to a location
        # If that fails, raise a KeyError if an integer
        # index, otherwise, see if key is an integer, and
        # try that
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return s[key]
    
    # Remaining code for non-ExtensionArray cases
```

In the corrected code, when the `get_value` method is called with an ExtensionArray, it directly retrieves the value without converting it unnecessarily to a materialized numpy array. This approach should help avoid densifying the ExtensionArray and resolve the performance issue described in the bug report.
