This issue seems to be related to the `get_value` method in the `Index` class. The problem appears to be that when filtering a series with a mask, it densifies the ExtensionArray, which can be very expensive if the ExtensionArray doesn't store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

The specific issue arises when `index.get_value` is called in the `__getitem__` method of the `Series` class. This ultimately leads to a call to `values_from_object`, which may be causing the densification of the ExtensionArray.

One possible approach to fixing this issue could be to avoid calling `values_from_object` or `get_value` in the `Index` class when dealing with ExtensionArrays. Instead, a different method of value retrieval or filtering could be implemented that doesn't lead to densification of the ExtensionArray.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method in the `Index` class:

```python
# this is the corrected get_value function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):

    if isinstance(series, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return series[iloc]

    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")

    return self._engine.get_value(com.values_from_object(series), k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
```
This corrected function aims to avoid densifying the ExtensionArray unnecessarily by directly accessing the value from the Series based on the location obtained from the Index.
