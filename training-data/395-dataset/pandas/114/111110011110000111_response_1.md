The error message indicates that when a Series is being filtered with a mask, the ExtensionArray is being converted to a materialized numpy array, which may be potentially expensive.

The problematic function in this case is the `get_value` method in the `Index` class. The issue arises when this method is called during filtering (using a mask) on a Series object. The method is trying to convert ExtensionArray to a numpy array, causing the error.

The reason behind the bug is that the `get_value` method is not handling ExtensionArray correctly and unnecessarily converting it to a numpy array. This behavior is leading to the observed densification of the ExtensionArray.

To fix the bug, the `get_value` method should be modified to handle ExtensionArray without converting it to a numpy array unnecessarily.

Below is the corrected `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    if isinstance(series, pd.Series) and series._is_view and isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
        return series._get_value_series(key)

    try:
        return super().get_value(series, key)
    except TypeError:
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series, key, series.index, series._is_scalar_access)
```

In this corrected method, we handle the ExtensionArray without converting it to a numpy array unnecessarily. This will prevent the unnecessary densification of the ExtensionArray during filtering operations.
