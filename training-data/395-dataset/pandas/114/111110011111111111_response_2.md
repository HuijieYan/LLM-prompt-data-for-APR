The error message highlights an `Exception: tried to convert a DecimalArray to a numpy array` when attempting to perform filtering operations on a series. This suggests that the filtering operation is causing the conversion of an ExtensionArray to a numpy array, which is not intended.

Upon analyzing the code, we can see that the `get_value` function in the `Index` class is being used to retrieve the value from the series based on the given key (in this case, the mask `s > 0.5`). The use of `values_from_object` within the `get_value` function may lead to the unintended materialization of the ExtensionArray, causing the exception.

The issue stems from the fact that `get_value` directly calls `values_from_object` which can trigger the conversion of an ExtensionArray to a numpy array, resulting in the unintended materialization.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to handle the ExtensionArray separately and prevent the unnecessary conversion to a numpy array. This can be achieved by specifically checking for the type of the object before converting it.

Here's the corrected `get_value` function:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    if isinstance(series, pd.Series) and isinstance(series.array, ExtensionArray):
        return series.array[key]
    else:
        # existing implementation for non-extension arrays
        s = com.values_from_object(series)
        k = com.values_from_object(key)
        
        k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
        try:
            return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
        except KeyError as e1:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise

            try:
                return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
            except IndexError:
                raise
            except TypeError:
                if is_iterator(key):
                    raise InvalidIndexError(key)
                else:
                    raise e1
            except Exception:
                raise e1
        except TypeError:
            if is_scalar(key):
                raise IndexError(key)
            raise InvalidIndexError(key)
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the `series` is a pandas Series with an ExtensionArray. If it is, we directly return the value from the ExtensionArray without unnecessary materialization. If not, the existing implementation for non-extension arrays is preserved.

This approach ensures that ExtensionArrays are handled separately to avoid the unintended materialization, addressing the bug reported.
