The buggy function is `get_value` within the `Index` class. The main issue with this function is that it is trying to handle various types of input keys (like integer, boolean, etc.) and apply different logic based on the type of key. However, the implementation seems to be convoluted and might be leading to unexpected behavior.

One approach to fixing this bug could be to simplify the logic within the `get_value` function and handle different types of input keys separately. This can reduce the complexity of the function and make it easier to understand and maintain.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)

    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return s[iloc]

    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)

    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
```

In this corrected code, the handling of different types of input keys is simplified, making the function less error-prone and easier to understand.
