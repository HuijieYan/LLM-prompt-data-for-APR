The error occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` method, particularly in the `column_op` functions where it's trying to perform the operation on a NumPy array and a 'NaTType' (Not a Time) object.

This error is triggered by the attempt to perform the multiplication operation (`*`) between a DataFrame and a series containing 'NaT' values.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle the case of 'NaT' values in the series and handle it as a special case where the result should also be 'NaT' instead of trying to perform multiplication with the DataFrame.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_scalar
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
import numpy as np

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

By adding the condition `if not pd.isna(b)` in the `column_op` function for scalar or 0-dimensional `right`, we ensure that the operation is only performed when the 'NaT' value is not present, effectively avoiding the TypeError caused by the unsupported operand types for multiplication.
