The error occurs during the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` where a DataFrame `df` is multiplied by a Series `ser` containing "NaT" values. The error message indicates that the `unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` occurred during the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series.

The bug is likely located within the `dispatch_to_series` function where the `column_op` function is used to perform column-wise operations for different data types. The error occurs because of the "NaT" values within the Series, which are not handled properly in the `column_op` function.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should be updated to handle "NaT" values appropriately for both scalar and Series inputs. Additionally, the conditionals for handling different data types should be updated to consider the case of "NaT".

Here's the corrected `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.api.types.is_scalar(b) and pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.api.types.is_scalar(b) and pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function now checks if the input `b` is a scalar and if it's NaN. If it is, it returns a dictionary with the same NaN value for each column. If the input `b` is not a scalar NaN, it proceeds with the column-wise operation as before. This change ensures that "NaT" values are handled correctly in the column-wise operations.
