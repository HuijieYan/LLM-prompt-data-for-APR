The error occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function is trying to evaluate the operation `df * ser`. The error message indicates that the operation `*` is being applied to an array and a NaTType (Not a Time) object, which is unsupported.

The bug is likely located in the `column_op` function within the `dispatch_to_series` function. It seems that the column_op function is attempting to perform operations with a scalar or a Series type which may result in wrongly using it with an array, which leads to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function needs to be modified to handle the different cases correctly. Specifically, it needs to handle scalar types, ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries, and other cases with the necessary checks to ensure that the operation is performed correctly without attempting to perform operations with unsupported types like NaTType.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
