The potential error location in the given function is in the `dispatch_to_series` function, as there are multiple conditions for different types of input and the wrong implementation might lead to incorrect results.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to handle different types of input (scalar, DataFrame, and Series) and apply the specified operation (`func`) in a column-wise manner.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the function and handle the different input cases separately. We can use the `apply` method for the DataFrame and Series operations, and use a conditional check for scalar input.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, (int, float)):  # Check if right is a scalar
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))  # Apply the func to each column in the DataFrame
    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]), axis=1)  # Apply the func to each row in the DataFrame
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if axis == "columns":
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=1)  # Apply the func to each row in the DataFrame
        else:
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))  # Apply the func to each element in the DataFrame
  
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, we handle scalar input, DataFrame input, and Series input separately using the `apply` method to apply the specified operation (`func`) in a column-wise or row-wise manner based on the input type and the `axis` parameter. This should resolve the bug in the original function.
