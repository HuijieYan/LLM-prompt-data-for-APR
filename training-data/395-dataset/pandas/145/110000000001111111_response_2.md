The issue arises in the function because the logic for handling different data types and index alignment is not correctly implemented. The code attempts to handle different cases based on the type and alignment of the input data, but the implementation includes errors which result in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling different types of input data and ensure that the index alignment is correctly handled. Additionally, the expressions used within the function need to be evaluated properly to avoid any unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index) and right.columns.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]), axis=0)
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]), axis=1)
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
    else:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, we have used the `apply` method along with lambda functions to apply the `func` operation on the columns or rows of the DataFrame based on the type and alignment of the input data. This approach ensures that the operations are performed correctly with the proper index alignment.
