The error occurs in the `na_arithmetic_op()` function when it tries to perform the operation `op(a, b)` where `a` is the array `[1, 3]` and `b` is `NaT`. This operation raises a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types for * (multiplication).

The bug is likely caused by the function `dispatch_to_series` not handling the case of `NaT` when performing the arithmetic operation. The implementation does not handle the `NaT` type correctly and results in a `TypeError` during the evaluation of the expression.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to correctly handle the `NaT` type when performing the arithmetic operation. Specifically, we need to implement a case for handling the `NaT` type within the `column_op` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if pd.isna(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    # remaining code remains the same
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `pd.isna(b)` to handle the case where `b` is `NaT`. If `b` is `NaT`, we return a dictionary with the same length as the columns in `a`, where all values are `NaT`. Otherwise, we perform the operation normally for non-`NaT` values.
