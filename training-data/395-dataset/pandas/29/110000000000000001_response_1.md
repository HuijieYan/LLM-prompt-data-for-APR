Potential Error: The potential error in the code is that the `__setitem__` method is not correctly updating the left and right values when a new key-value pair is added.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the method does not handle updates to the left and right values correctly. Additionally, there is an issue with checking for the `isna` value and handling different data types.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly handle the updating of the left and right values based on the key-value pair.
2. Check for `isna` value and handle different data types appropriately.

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if isna(value):
        value = np.nan
    key = check_array_indexer(self, key)
    self.left.values[key] = value.left
    self.right.values[key] = value.right
```
