The potential error location within the problematic function is with the assignment of `left` and `right` values.

The bug occurs because the `left` and `right` values are not being updated atomically, leading to inconsistent states for the `left` and `right` properties.

To fix the bug, we can update the `left` and `right` values atomically, by copying the original `left` and `right` properties, updating the copies, and then swapping in the new values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    # ... (previous code) ...
    # Need to ensure that left and right are updated atomically, so we're
    # forced to copy, update the copy, and swap in the new values.
    left = self.left.copy(deep=True)
    if needs_float_conversion:
        left = left.astype("float")
    left.values[key] = value_left

    right = self.right.copy(deep=True)
    if needs_float_conversion:
        right = right.astype("float")
    right.values[key] = value_right

    self._left = left
    self._right = right
```

In the corrected code, we copy the `left` and `right` properties, update the copies with the new values, and then assign the updated copies back to the original properties. This ensures that the `left` and `right` properties are updated atomically, preventing inconsistent states.
