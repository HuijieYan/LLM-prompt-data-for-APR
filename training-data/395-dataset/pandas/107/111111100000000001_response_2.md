The problem with the `append` function is that it has a logical issue with how it handles the input `other`. The code tries to handle different input types (`Series`, `dict`, and `list`) and their combinations, but the logic around handling these input types is not consistent and can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this, the function needs to have separate logic for handling `Series`, `dict`, and `list` input types. Each input type should be handled separately to ensure consistent behavior and to avoid unexpected results.

Here's the corrected `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=False):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default False
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23.0
        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0

            Changed to not sort by default.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    --------
    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.
    """

    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, (Series, dict)):
        if isinstance(other, dict):
            other = Series(other)
        if other.name is None and not ignore_index:
            raise TypeError(
                "Can only append a Series if ignore_index=True"
                " or if the Series has a name"
            )

        if other.name is None:
            index = None
        else:
            index = Index([other.name], name=self.index.name)

        other = DataFrame(other)
        if (self.columns.get_indexer(other.columns) >= 0).all():
            other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)

        to_concat = [self, other]
    elif isinstance(other, list):
        to_concat = [self] + other
    else:
        to_concat = [self, other]

    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```

In the corrected function, each input type (`Series`, `dict`, and `list`) is handled separately, ensuring consistent behavior and avoiding unexpected results. Additionally, the logic for handling `Series` and `dict` inputs has been improved to ensure proper concatenation with the original `DataFrame`.
