Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the `append` method of the `DataFrame` class. The method incorrectly removes the timezone-awareness when appending rows.

Reasons behind the bug: 
The bug occurs because when a DataFrame with timezone-aware datetime data is appended to another DataFrame, the timezone-awareness is not preserved in the resulting DataFrame.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the data being appended contains datetime data and if so, preserve the timezone-awareness in the resulting DataFrame.
2. Modify the `append` method to handle datetime data appropriately, ensuring that timezone-awareness is maintained.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    to_concat = [self, other]
    return concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity, sort=sort)
```
