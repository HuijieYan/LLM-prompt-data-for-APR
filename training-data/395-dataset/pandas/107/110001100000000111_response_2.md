The error in the code is due to the fact that when `df.append(df.iloc[0])` is being used, it removes the timezone awareness from the timestamp.

The bug is caused by the `_convert` method call on the `other` DataFrame, which removes timezone awareness from the timestamps. This happens in the following line:

```python
other = other._convert(datetime=True, timedelta=True)
```

To fix this bug, the `_convert` method should not be called on `other` DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=False):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default False
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23.0
        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0

            Changed to not sort by default.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    See Also
    --------
    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + other
    else:
        to_concat = [self, other]
    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```

Removing the `_convert` method call from the `append` function eliminates the behavior of removing the timezone awareness from the timestamps.
