The error occurs when the `concat` function is called from within the `test_duplicate_keys` function. This error arises because the `_make_concat_multiindex` function, which is being called within the `concat` method, contains some issues related to the creation and verification of MultiIndex objects.

The bug in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function is causing the MultiIndex object to be created incorrectly, leading to the TypeError when trying to convert the object to the required data type.

To fix this bug, we need to address the issues in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function regarding the creation of MultiIndex objects, especially the handling of the levels, codes, and names. Additionally, we need to ensure proper error handling and verification of the integrity of the MultiIndex object.

Below is the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.api import ensure_index
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas import MultiIndex
import numpy as np

def _concat_indexes(indexes) -> Index:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    if levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple):
        keys = list(zip(*keys))

    levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels] if levels else [ensure_index(keys)]
    names = [None] if names is None else names

    if not all(i.equals(indexes[0]) for i in indexes):
        raise ValueError("Incompatible indexes")

    codes_list = []
    for hlevel, index in zip(keys, indexes):
        try:
            i = level.get_indexer(hlevel)
        except KeyError as err:
            raise ValueError(f"Key {hlevel} not found in level {level}") from err
        to_concat = np.repeat(i, len(index))
        codes_list.append(to_concat)

    new_levels = levels + [indexes[0]]
    new_codes = codes_list + [np.tile(np.arange(len(indexes[0])), len(indexes))]
    new_names = names + list(indexes[0].names)

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )
```

In the corrected code, we have handled the level, code, and name creation more robustly, ensuring that they are compatible with given indexes and concatenate along the appropriate axis. We have also added an integrity check for the MultiIndex object before its creation.

This revised implementation should address the TypeError issue and handle the creation of MultiIndex objects correctly for concatenation.
