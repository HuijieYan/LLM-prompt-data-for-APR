It appears that the bug is related to the incorrect generation of the `codes_list` variable and the subsequent construction of the `MultiIndex`. This is likely causing the function to return unexpected results or encounter errors when concatenating the DataFrame with the Series.

The bug seems to be occurring in the portion of the code where `codes_list` is constructed using the zipped keys and indexes. It looks like the zipped keys are not being handled correctly in the construction of `codes_list`. The issue may be related to incorrect slicing operations, index handling, or generation of codes.

To fix this bug, it is important to ensure that the construction of `codes_list` is correctly aligned with the expected behavior of concatenating the indexes. This may involve revisiting the logic for constructing `codes_list` and ensuring that it properly reflects the relationship between the keys and indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.base import ensure_index
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    if levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple):
        keys = list(zip(*keys))
    if levels is None:
        levels, _ = factorize_from_iterables(keys)
    else:
        levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    codes_list = []
    for key in keys:
        level_index = levels[keys.index(key)]
        codes = [level_index.get_loc(k) for k in key]
        codes_list.append(codes)

    index = MultiIndex.from_tuples(keys, names=names)
    index.codes = codes_list
    return index
```

In the corrected code, we form the `keys` as tuples and then iterate through the `keys` to get the appropriate `codes` for each level. This ensures that the `codes_list` is correctly constructed based on the keys and levels. The corrected code also assigns the `codes_list` to the `MultiIndex` object and returns it as the expected output.
