Analysis:
The error message "TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'slice'" indicates that there is an issue with concatenating a DataFrame with a Series with duplicate keys.

Potential Error Location:
The error may be occurring in the _make_concat_multiindex function, specifically in the logic related to concatenating indexes.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of duplicate keys when concatenating indexes, leading to the TypeError message.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for duplicate keys in the input indexes and handle them appropriately during the concatenation process.
2. Ensure that the levels, names, and codes are handled correctly when concatenating indexes with duplicate keys.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:

    if (levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple)) or (
        levels is not None and len(levels) > 1
    ):
        zipped = list(zip(*keys))
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(zipped)

        if levels is None:
            _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]
    else:
        zipped = [keys]
        if names is None:
            names = [None]

        if levels is None:
            levels = [ensure_index(keys)]
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    if not all_indexes_same(indexes):
        # Handling duplicate keys during concatenation
        codes_list = []
        idx_set = set()
        for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
            to_concat = []
            for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
                try:
                    i = level.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError as err:
                    raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err
                if i in idx_set:
                    raise ValueError(f"Duplicate index key: {key}")
                idx_set.add(i)

                to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
            codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat))

        concat_index = _concat_indexes(indexes)

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
In the corrected code, I have added a check for duplicate index keys during the concatenation process, and an appropriate ValueError is raised if duplicate keys are found. This ensures that the function handles the issue of concatenating indexes with duplicate keys correctly.
