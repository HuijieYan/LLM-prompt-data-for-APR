The potential error location within the problematic function is at the start of the `_make_concat_multiindex` function, where the indentation of the function is incorrect. It should be at the same level as the `_concat_indexes` function.

The bug occurred due to incorrect indentation, which resulted in the function `_make_concat_multiindex` being defined inside the `_concat_indexes` function.

To fix the bug, the `_make_concat_multiindex` function should be re-indented to be at the same level as the `_concat_indexes` function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _concat_indexes(indexes) -> Index:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    if (levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple)) or (levels is not None and len(levels) > 1):
        zipped = list(zip(*keys))
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(zipped)

        if levels is None:
            _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]
    else:
        zipped = [keys]
        if names is None:
            names = [None]

        if levels is None:
            levels = [ensure_index(keys)]
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
