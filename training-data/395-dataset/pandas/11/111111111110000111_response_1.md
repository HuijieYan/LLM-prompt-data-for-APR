The error occurs when attempting to concatenate a DataFrame with Series using duplicate keys. The error message is related to a TypeError and an AssertionError, indicating issues with the concatenation process and the number of manager items that must equal the union of block items.

The potential error location is within the `_make_concat_multiindex` function, where the allocation and concatenation of levels, codes, and names for the MultiIndex may be causing the issues.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the concatenation of DataFrame and Series with duplicate keys properly. This results in a mismatch of sizes and an error during the concatenation process.

To fix the bug, the function `_make_concat_multiindex` should be modified to ensure that the concatenation process properly handles the allocation and concatenation of levels, codes, and names for the MultiIndex. Additionally, special handling for cases with duplicate keys should be implemented to avoid size mismatches and errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
from pandas import MultiIndex, ensure_index, factorize_from_iterables
import numpy as np

def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    zipped = list(zip(*keys))
    if levels is None:
        _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
    else:
        levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    codes_list = []
    for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
        to_concat = []
        for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
            try:
                i = level.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError as err:
                raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err
            to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
        codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat))

    if not names:
        names = [None] * len(levels)
    elif len(names) != len(levels):
        names += [None] * (len(levels) - len(names))
    
    return MultiIndex(levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
```

By applying these changes, the function should now handle the concatenation of DataFrame and Series with duplicate keys correctly, resolving the bug.
