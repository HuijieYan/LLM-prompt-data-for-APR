The bug appears to be related to the `pd.concat` function when concatenating a DataFrame with a Series with duplicate keys. The error message "TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'slice'" suggests that there is an issue with the data type being passed to the `int()` function.

Upon analyzing the provided function `_make_concat_multiindex`, it seems that the bug could be related to the way keys are being handled and the construction of the MultiIndex.

One possible reason for the bug occurring is that the function is not properly handling the duplicate keys when constructing the MultiIndex. This could lead to incorrect data types being passed to the `int()` function, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function `_make_concat_multiindex` needs to be updated to properly handle the concatenation of DataFrames and Series with duplicate keys. This may involve revising the logic for constructing the MultiIndex from the keys, levels, and names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    from pandas.core.algorithms import factorize_from_iterables
    import numpy as np

    zipped = list(zip(*keys))
    if names is None:
        names = [None] * len(zipped)

    if levels is None:
        levels, _ = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
    else:
        levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    codes_list = []
    for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
        codes_list.append(level.get_indexer_for(hlevel))

    new_index = indexes[0]
    n = len(new_index)
    
    new_names = list(names)
    new_levels = list(levels)
    new_codes = codes_list

    return MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False)
```

This corrected code addresses the handling of keys, levels, and names to ensure that the MultiIndex is constructed properly when concatenating DataFrames and Series with duplicate keys.
