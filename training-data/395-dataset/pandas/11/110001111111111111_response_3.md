The error message indicates a TypeError related to the 'slice' object being passed to the 'int' function. This could be due to incorrect handling or type conversion of the slice object in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function.

The potential error location within the function could be in the `to_concat` list creation, where it seems that the `repeat` function might be receiving a slice object instead of an integer.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the 'slice' object properly when creating the `to_concat` list. The `repeat` function expects an integer, but is receiving a slice object in this context.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `to_concat` list contains only integer values, and handle the slice objects appropriately. This can be achieved by using the appropriate indexing or conversion to integer values before passing to the `repeat` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # logic for creating zipped, names, and other variables remain unchanged...

    # rest of the code...

    if levels is None:
        # updated logic to handle the slice object appropriately
        idx_map = dict(zip(level, range(len(level))))
        to_concat = [np.array([idx_map.get(key, -1) for key in hlevel])]
    else:
        to_concat = [np.repeat(-1, len(hlevel))]

    # rest of the code...

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False
    )
```

This correction ensures that the `to_concat` list only contains integer values and handles the slice objects correctly. This should resolve the TypeError related to the 'slice' object.
