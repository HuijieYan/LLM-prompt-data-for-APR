The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it is trying to concatenate the indexes.

The bug occurred because the function is not handling the concatenation of the indexes properly. It is also not handling the cases where the indexes have different levels or names.

To fix the bug, we can use the `from_arrays` function provided by Pandas to create the MultiIndex instead of manually constructing the levels and codes. We also need to handle the cases where the indexes have different levels or names by checking for these differences and raising an error if necessary.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the levels and codes are properly concatenated and the names are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:

    try:
        return MultiIndex.from_arrays(keys, names=names)
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Error creating MultiIndex: {e}")

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=None, codes=None, names=None, verify_integrity=False
    )
```
