The test case provided in the GitHub issue involves concatenating a DataFrame with two Series along the columns axis, using the keys 'a', 'b', and 'b'. The expected output is to have the original DataFrame columns labeled as 'a' and 'b', and the Series labels as 'b' and 'b', but the actual output is a TypeError.

Upon reviewing the provided function, it seems that the error is occurring in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of concatenating multiple indexes and assigning names to them.

To address the bug, the function `_make_concat_multiindex` needs to be modified to correctly handle the concatenation of multiple indexes with proper naming. Additionally, the function should be updated to handle the specific case mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

    if levels is None:
        levels = [None] * len(keys)

    if names is None:
        names = [None] * len(keys)

    if isinstance(keys[0], tuple):
        zipped = list(zip(*keys))
    else:
        zipped = [keys]

    if len(zipped) != len(levels):
        raise ValueError("Number of levels must match the number of keys")

    new_levels = []
    new_codes = []

    for key, level, zipped_vals in zip(keys, levels, zipped):
        if level is None:
            level = ensure_index(zipped_vals)
        elif not isinstance(level, MultiIndex):
            level = ensure_index(level)

        codes = np.tile(np.arange(len(level)), len(indexes))
        new_levels.append(level)
        new_codes.append(codes)

    if len(names) < len(new_levels):
        names.extend([None] * (len(new_levels) - len(names)))

    return MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
```

This corrected function ensures that the keys and levels are correctly handled, and it addresses the bug related to concatenating a DataFrame with Series with duplicate keys.
