Based on the provided test cases and their error messages, the issue seems to be occurring in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function. The error message indicates that some arrays must be the same length, so this likely means that the code that handles different lengths of the `indexes` is not working as intended.

The code has some sections for handling different lengths of the `indexes` but it seems that the logic is not consistent throughout the function. The function is complex and requires handling various scenarios related to MultiIndex. The error is likely due to inconsistent or incorrect handling of different lengths of `indexes`. More specifically, the issue might be with the concatenation and processing of `codes_list`, where different lengths in `indexes` are not correctly accounted for.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the function properly handles different lengths of `indexes` and correctly calculates the codes for the MultiIndex. Additionally, it might be useful to use descriptive variable names or comments to improve the readability and maintainability of the code. Testing different scenarios involving variations in the lengths of `indexes` is also important to verify the correctness of the fixed function.

The corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function is as follows:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    if (levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple)) or (levels is not None and len(levels) > 1):
        zipped = list(zip(*keys))
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(zipped)

        if levels is None:
            _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]
    else:
        zipped = [keys]
        if names is None:
            names = [None]

        if levels is None:
            levels = [ensure_index(keys)]
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    if not all_indexes_same(indexes) or len({idx.nlevels for idx in indexes}) != 1:
        raise AssertionError("Cannot concat indices that do not have the same number of levels")

    codes_list = []
    for hlevel, index in zip(zipped, indexes):
        level = ensure_index(hlevel)
        allocated = level.get_indexer(index)

        mask = allocated == -1
        if mask.any():
            raise ValueError(f"Values not found in passed level: {hlevel[mask]!s}")

        if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
            levels.extend(index.levels)
            codes_list.extend([np.tile(allocated, len(index.levels))])
        else:
            levels.append(index)
            codes_list.append(np.tile(allocated, 1))

    if len(names) < len(levels):
        names.extend(indexes[0].names)

    return MultiIndex(levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
```

This corrected code addresses issues related to handling different lengths of `indexes`, ensures consistency in the handling of MultiIndex, and provides better error handling for scenarios where lengths of `indexes` differ.
