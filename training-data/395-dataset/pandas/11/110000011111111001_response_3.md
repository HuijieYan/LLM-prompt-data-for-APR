The error message indicates that there is a problem with concatenation, including mismatched lengths of arrays in the MultiIndex. This suggests that the bug is likely in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function, particularly when dealing with concatenating the indexes and constructing the MultiIndex for further concatenation.

The potential bug is likely in the part where the function handles concatenation of indexes with mismatched lengths, and constructing the MultiIndex with the levels, codes, and names.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the concatenation of indexes and construction of MultiIndex correctly when they have different lengths. This results in a mismatch and causes the subsequent concatenation operation to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the concatenation of indexes with different lengths properly. This involves checking the lengths of the indexes and aligning the levels, codes, and names accordingly before constructing the MultiIndex.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # ... (existing code)

    # Check if all indexes have the same levels, if not raise an error
    if not all(idx.nlevels == indexes[0].nlevels for idx in indexes):
        raise AssertionError("Cannot concat indices that do not have the same number of levels")

    # Concatenate any differences in the levels, codes, and names
    levels_list = []
    codes_list = []
    names_list = []
    for idx in indexes:
        levels_list.extend(idx.levels)
        codes_list.extend(idx.codes)
        names_list.extend(idx.names)

    # Construct the MultiIndex with the concatenated levels, codes, and names
    return MultiIndex(levels=levels_list, codes=codes_list, names=names_list, verify_integrity=False)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if all indexes have the same number of levels. If not, we raise an error. Then, we concatenate the levels, codes, and names of all indexes before constructing the MultiIndex. This ensures that the MultiIndex is properly formed, and concatenation of indexes with different lengths is handled correctly.
