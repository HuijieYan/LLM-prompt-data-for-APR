The bug in the provided code is likely due to incorrect handling of the 'levels' and 'zipped' variables, leading to unexpected behavior when generating the 'codes_list' and 'to_concat' arrays.

The bug may be related to the discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual concatenation/mapping of levels and keys. Additionally, the usage of 'np.repeat' and 'np.concatenate' may not be consistent with the expected behavior and results.

To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure that the concatenation and mapping of levels and keys are performed correctly. This involves properly handling the indices and iterations over levels and keys to generate the 'codes_list' and 'to_concat' arrays.

Also, the mapping operations such as 'get_loc' and 'get_indexer' need to be used consistently and with the correct input parameters to avoid unexpected results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import Index, MultiIndex
import numpy as np

def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    if levels is None:
        levels = [keys]

    if names is None:
        names = [None] * len(levels)

    codes_list = [np.repeat(np.arange(len(level)), len(index)) for level, index in zip(levels, indexes)]

    if levels[0] == keys:
        levels.pop(0)

    for idx in indexes:
        if isinstance(idx, MultiIndex):
            levels.extend(idx.levels)
            codes_list.extend(idx.codes)
        else:
            codes, categories = pd.factorize(idx)
            levels.append(categories)
            codes_list.append(codes)

    if len(names) < len(levels):
        names.extend([None]*(len(levels)-len(names)))

    return MultiIndex(levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
```
