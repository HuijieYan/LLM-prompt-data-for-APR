The bug occurred due to a problem in the logic of concatenating the MultiIndex. Specifically, the issue arises when the function encounters duplicate keys during concatenation, leading to an error. In this case, the code is trying to concatenate a DataFrame with Series using duplicate keys.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for concatenating MultiIndex and handling duplicate keys.

To fix the bug:
1. The code needs to have a mechanism to handle duplicate keys during concatenation, possibly by checking for duplicates and resolving them.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # ... (existing logic)

    # If condition to check for duplicate keys
    if any(keys.duplicated()):
        raise ValueError("Duplicate keys found during concatenation")

    # ... (remaining logic)

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `if` condition checks for any duplicate keys, and if found, raises a ValueError indicating the presence of duplicate keys during concatenation.

This fix addresses the bug by explicitly handling duplicate keys during concatenation.
