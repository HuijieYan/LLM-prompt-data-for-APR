The error message indicates that there is an issue related to the length of arrays or items that need to be equal but are not in the concat function. The error likely occurs in the _make_concat_multiindex function, particularly in the part where it constructs new levels and new codes.

The bug seems to be related to the way the function is dealing with concatenating dataframes, series, and keys. The function is not properly handling the different lengths of the input data, which leads to the error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the different lengths of input data more gracefully. This could involve checking the lengths of the data before attempting to concatenate them and raising a meaningful error if the lengths are not compatible.

Below is the corrected version of the _make_concat_multiindex function:

```python
from pandas import MultiIndex
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.indexes.api import ensure_index

def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # Checking for consistent lengths of keys and indexes
    if len(keys) != len(indexes):
        raise ValueError("The length of keys must be equal to the length of indexes")

    if levels is not None and len(levels) > 1:
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(keys)
        
        # Extract levels from keys if levels are not provided
        _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(list(zip(*keys)))
        levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    else:
        if names is None:
            names = [None]
        levels = [ensure_index(keys)]

    concatenated_indexes = _concat_indexes(indexes)

    if isinstance(concatenated_indexes, MultiIndex):
        levels.extend(concatenated_indexes.levels)
        codes = concatenated_indexes.codes
    else:
        codes, categories = factorize_from_iterable(concatenated_indexes)
        levels.append(categories)

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=levels,
        codes=codes,
        names=names,
        verify_integrity=False
    )
```

The corrected code includes checks for equal lengths of keys and indexes, and appropriately combines the indexes while handling MultiIndex objects. It also provides better handling of levels when the keys and indexes are provided with different lengths.
