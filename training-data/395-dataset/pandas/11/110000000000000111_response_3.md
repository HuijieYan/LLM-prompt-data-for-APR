The error message "TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'slice'" is likely caused by an issue with the concatenation of DataFrame and Series objects using the `pd.concat` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the part where the function is trying to concatenate the indexes.

The bug occurred because the function was not handling the concatenation of DataFrame and Series objects with duplicate keys properly, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the function can handle the concatenation of DataFrame and Series objects with duplicate keys by properly indexing and concatenating the MultiIndex levels and codes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # Verify all indexes are the same
    if not all_indexes_same(indexes):
        raise AssertionError("Cannot concat indices that do not have the same number of levels")

    # Concatenate the indexes
    concat_index = _concat_indexes(indexes)

    # Construct the MultiIndex
    new_index = concat_index if isinstance(concat_index, MultiIndex) else concat_index
    return new_index
```

In the corrected code, the function ensures that all indexes are the same before attempting to concatenate them. Once verified, the function simply concatenates the indexes using the `_concat_indexes` function and returns the new index. This approach simplifies the function and avoids potential errors related to duplicate keys.
