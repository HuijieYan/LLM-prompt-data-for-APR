Potential error location: The bug might occur in the section where the function is trying to construct the new_codes for the MultiIndex.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. It appears that the way the new_codes are being constructed for the MultiIndex may not be handling the conditions properly, leading to potential errors in the creation of the MultiIndex.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the construction of new_codes for the MultiIndex properly handles different cases such as when the new_index is a MultiIndex or a single index.
2. Check for any potential issues with the mapping and repetition of codes that could lead to errors.

Corrected code:

```python
from pandas import MultiIndex
import numpy as np

def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    ...
    # existing code here

    new_index = indexes[0]
    n = len(new_index)
    kpieces = len(indexes)

    # also copies
    new_names = list(names) if names is not None else [None] * len(levels)
    new_levels = list(levels) if levels is not None else [ensure_index(keys)]

    # construct codes
    new_codes = []

    for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
        hlevel = ensure_index(hlevel)
        mapped = level.get_indexer(hlevel)

        mask = mapped == -1
        if mask.any():
            raise ValueError(f"Values not found in passed level: {hlevel[mask]!s}")

        new_codes.append(np.repeat(mapped, n))

    if isinstance(new_index, MultiIndex):
        new_levels.extend(new_index.levels)
        new_codes.extend(new_index.codes)
    else:
        new_levels.append(new_index)
        new_codes.append(np.tile(np.arange(n), kpieces))

    if len(new_names) == len(new_levels):
        names = list(names)
    else:
        # make sure that all of the passed indices have the same nlevels
        if not len({idx.nlevels for idx in indexes}) == 1:
            raise AssertionError(
                "Cannot concat indices that do not have the same number of levels"
            )

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )
```
