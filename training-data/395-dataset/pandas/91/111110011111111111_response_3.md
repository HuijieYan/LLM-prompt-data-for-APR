The error "ValueError: Value must be Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta or convertible, not Period" is occurring because the `searchsorted` method in the `TimedeltaIndex` class does not handle the `Period` object correctly. It should be able to handle the `Period` object as one of the allowed types according to the function's documentation.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `searchsorted` method to handle the `Period` object by including it in the condition where the value is checked for its type and converted appropriately if needed. The method should be able to convert the `Period` object to a compatible type for the search sorted functionality.

Below is the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, pd.Period):  # Handle Period object
        value = Timedelta(value.end_time - value.start_time, "ns").asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    else:
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

With this correction, the `searchsorted` method should be able to handle the `Period` object correctly and not raise a ValueError. The method will first check if the value is a `Period` and then convert it into a compatible type for the search operation.
