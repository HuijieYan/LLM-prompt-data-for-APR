The error occurs in the `searchsorted` function of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. This function is supposed to find the indices where the input values should be inserted in order to maintain the order of the timedelta values. However, the function is currently generating a `ValueError` when called with certain types of input values.

The function is expected to handle a variety of input types, including integers, floats, datetime64, and others, and return the insertion indices. However, in the case of some input types like Timestamp, the function is currently throwing a `ValueError` instead of the expected `TypeError`.

The reason behind this behavior is that the function is not handling the input types correctly. It is supposed to check the type of the input, convert it into the appropriate format, and then perform the searchsorted operation. However, the current implementation is not handling this conversion properly, leading to the `ValueError` when encountering unexpected input types.

To fix this issue, the `searchsorted` function needs to have proper handling for different input types. It should check the type of the input value and convert it into the appropriate format (Timedelta) before calling the `searchsorted` method on the values attribute.

Below is the corrected code for the `searchsorted` function:

```python
@Substitution(klass="TimedeltaIndex")
@Appender(_shared_docs["searchsorted"])
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, pd.Timestamp):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    elif isinstance(value, pd.Period):
        value = Timedelta(value.to_timestamp()).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    else:
        # Handle other types of input here, e.g., integers, floats
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

With this fixed implementation, the `searchsorted` function will properly handle different types of input values and perform the searchsorted operation correctly, returning the insertion indices as expected.
