Potential error location: The error could potentially occur in the assignment of the 'value' variable, specifically in the 'if' condition where 'value' is checked for being an instance of either np.ndarray or Index.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug could occur if 'value' is not an instance of np.ndarray or Index, as the code attempts to use 'value' in a way that assumes it is of a specific type. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The 'if' condition should be modified to explicitly handle the case where 'value' is not an instance of np.ndarray or Index. This could involve converting 'value' to an appropriate type, or handling it in a different way depending on its actual type.

Corrected code:
```python
# signature of a relative function in this class
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# this is the corrected function
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        # handle the case where 'value' is not an instance of np.ndarray or Index
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
