The error message indicates that the `searchsorted` function is not behaving as expected, raising a `ValueError` instead of the expected `TypeError` in certain cases. Upon further examination, it appears that the function is incorrectly trying to convert the input `value` to a `Timedelta` object, which leads to unexpected errors when non-convertible types are passed as `value`. This is causing the test cases to fail with different kinds of errors, such as `ValueError` instead of the expected `TypeError`, as well as raising errors for non-compatible types like `datetime64`.

To fix the bug, the `searchsorted` function should not try to convert the `value` to a `Timedelta` object. Instead, it should directly use the input `value` and perform the search operation on the array.

Below is the corrected code for the `searchsorted` function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

By simplifying the function to directly use the input `value` without unnecessary type conversions, the issues with unexpected errors and incorrect behavior should be resolved. The corrected function should now behave as expected and pass the test cases properly.
