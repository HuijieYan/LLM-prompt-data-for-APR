The error message from the test function indicates that the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class is not behaving as expected. The error is due to a `ValueError` being raised instead of the expected `TypeError` in certain cases. The `searchsorted` method is expected to handle various input types such as integers, floats, timedeltas, strings, and compatible numpy arrays, but the current implementation is not handling these inputs correctly.

Upon reviewing the function `searchsorted` of the `TimedeltaIndex` class, the issue lies in the conversion of the `value` parameter. The input value should be converted into a timedelta format before performing the `searchsorted` operation. However, the current implementation unintentionally raises a `ValueError` in some cases where conversion is not performed correctly.

To fix this bug, the `searchsorted` method needs to be modified to correctly handle different types of input values. The method should check the type of input value and then convert it to a timedelta format if necessary before performing the search operation.

Here's the corrected function for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, Timedelta):
        if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
            value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
        else:
            value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected implementation, the method checks if the input value is not already a `Timedelta`. If not, it performs the necessary conversion according to the input type before proceeding with the `searchsorted` operation. This should address the issue and ensure that the correct error types are raised depending on the input value.
