The error message "searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar" indicates that there are issues with the data types being passed to the `searchsorted` function in the `TimedeltaArray` class. It seems that the function is not handling the input data types correctly, leading to the ValueError or TypeError exceptions.

Looking at the test cases, it seems that the function is not handling the different input data types such as int, float, datetime, and invalid inputs correctly. The error messages show that the function is raising ValueError or TypeError when it should handle these data types more gracefully.

To fix the bug, the input data types need to be handled appropriately within the `searchsorted` function to avoid ValueError or TypeError. This may involve adding type checks or conversions to ensure that the input values are compatible with the expected data types for the searchsorted operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function code
@Substitution(klass="TimedeltaIndex")
@Appender(_shared_docs["searchsorted"])
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    
    if isinstance(value, np.ndarray):
        value = value.astype(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In the corrected function, we check if the input `value` is not an instance of `(np.ndarray, Index)` and then convert it to an array with the appropriate data type. Additionally, we perform an explicit conversion to `_TD_DTYPE` if `value` is an instance of `np.ndarray`. This should handle the different input data types more gracefully and prevent the ValueError or TypeError exceptions that were occurring.
