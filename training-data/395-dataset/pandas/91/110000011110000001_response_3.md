The error occurs due to a ValueError being raised by the searchsorted method when it's called with certain types of input. The error message indicates that the value must be Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta, or convertible, but it's receiving other types such as datetime64 and Period.

The bug seems to be related to the conversion of certain types of input values. The searchsorted method is expecting values of specific types, but the function is not handling the conversion of certain types properly.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the conversion of input values more robustly, ensuring that the input types are properly handled and converted to the required types expected by the searchsorted method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Period)):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    else:
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
