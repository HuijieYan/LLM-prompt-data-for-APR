The error occurs in the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. This method accepts a `value` parameter and is supposed to return the positions of the elements of `self` where `value` should be inserted to maintain the order. However, it is currently raising ValueError or not raising TypeError as per the test case, indicating a bug in the implementation.

The bug is most likely due to improper handling of the `value` parameter in the `searchsorted` method. The method is incorrectly converting the `value` parameter to `Timedelta` and attempting to view it as `_TD_DTYPE` which is leading to the raised ValueError or not raising TypeError as per the test case.

To fix this bug, the method should handle the different types of `value` parameters appropriately and consider the specified `side` and `sorter` parameters while performing the search and returning the result.

Below is the corrected `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype='timedelta64[ns]', copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, np.integer)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype='timedelta64[ns]', copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, float):
        value = np.array([value], dtype='timedelta64[ns]', copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (str, pd.Timedelta, pd.Timestamp)):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value).asm8.view('timedelta64[ns]')
    else:  # handle other types appropriately
        raise TypeError("value must be an array, integer, float, string, Timedelta, or Timestamp")

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected method:
- We handle different types of `value` parameters appropriately.
- When `value` is an array, integer, or float, it is converted to a NumPy array with the appropriate data type.
- When `value` is a string, Timedelta, or Timestamp, it is converted to a timedelta with appropriate conversion.
- If an invalid type of `value` is passed, a TypeError is raised, as described in the test case.

With these changes, the `searchsorted` method should now handle different types of `value` parameters correctly and return the expected result without raising ValueError or not raising TypeError as per the test case.
