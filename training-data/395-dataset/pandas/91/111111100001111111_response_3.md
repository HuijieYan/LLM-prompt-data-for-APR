The bug is in the searchsorted method of the TimedeltaIndex class. The method is intended to find the indices where the input value should be inserted into the TimedeltaIndex to maintain sorted order.

The bug occurs because the input parameter, 'value', is being converted into a numpy timedelta64 object regardless of its original type. This conversion is incorrect and can lead to unexpected behavior especially when 'value' is an ndarray or an Index.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conversion of the 'value' parameter based on its original type. If 'value' is an ndarray or an Index, it should not be converted. Only when 'value' is a single integer or float, it should be converted to a numpy timedelta64 object.

Here's the corrected code for the searchsorted method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (int, float)):
        value = np.timedelta64(int(value), 'ns')
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
