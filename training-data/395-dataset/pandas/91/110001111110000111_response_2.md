The error message indicates that the function `searchsorted` in the file `timedeltas.py` is not handling some input types correctly. The test cases are raising errors when the function is called with various input types such as integers, floats, datetime objects, and arrays.

Upon inspection of the function `searchsorted`, it seems that the issue arises when it receives input that is not of type `Timedelta`. The function tries to convert the input to a `Timedelta` using `Timedelta(value)`, and this is where the error occurs. The function should be able to handle various input types without raising a `ValueError`.

To fix the issue, the function needs to check the type of the input and handle the conversion appropriately. It should not assume that the input is a `Timedelta`. If the input is not of type `Timedelta`, appropriate actions should be taken to handle the input.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, Timedelta):
        value = Timedelta(value)
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

This modified code checks if the `value` is not of type `Timedelta`, and if not, it converts it to a `Timedelta` before passing it to the `searchsorted` method. This will ensure that the function can handle various input types correctly.
