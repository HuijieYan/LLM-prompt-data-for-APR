The bug is located in the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The purpose of this method is to find the indices where the input `value` should be inserted in order to maintain the sorted order of the `TimedeltaIndex` values.

The bug occurs because the input `value` is expected to be a `timedelta64` object, but in some situations, it is not being converted correctly to this data type before being used in the `searchsorted` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input `value` is properly converted to a `timedelta64` object before it is passed to the `searchsorted` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype='timedelta64[ns]', copy=False)
    else:
        value = np.timedelta64(value, 'ns')

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

This corrected code first checks if the `value` is an array or Index, and if so, it converts it to the correct data type. If the `value` is not an array or Index, it directly converts it to a `timedelta64` object using `np.timedelta64(value, 'ns')`.

With this correction, the `searchsorted` method should now work correctly for all the test cases provided.
