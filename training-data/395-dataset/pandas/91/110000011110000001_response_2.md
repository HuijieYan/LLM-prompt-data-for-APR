The error message in the test function indicates that the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaArray` is not behaving as expected. This error is caused by the specific implementation within the method.

The bug is likely occurring inside the `searchsorted` method due to improper handling of different types of input values. The method should be able to handle a variety of input types, such as integers, floats, datetimes, and other compatible types, but it seems to be throwing an error when dealing with certain input values.

To fix the bug, the `searchsorted` method should be modified to handle different input types appropriately. This may involve adding type checks and conversions to ensure that the input values are compatible with the search behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
class TimedeltaIndex:
    ...

    def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
        if isinstance(value, (int, float, datetime.datetime, str, pd.Timedelta)):
            value = pd.Timedelta(value)  # Convert various input types to Timedelta
        elif isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
            if value.dtype != "timedelta64[ns]":
                raise TypeError("Input array must have dtype 'timedelta64[ns]'")
        else:
            raise TypeError("Unsupported value type for searchsorted")

        return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In the corrected code, the `searchsorted` method now checks the type of the input value and converts it to a `pd.Timedelta` when necessary to ensure compatibility. Additionally, it performs type checks for arrays and raises appropriate errors for unsupported input types.
