The bug in the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class is due to an incorrect implementation. When the method is called with certain parameters, it is raising a `ValueError` instead of the expected `TypeError` as specified in the test cases. This indicates that the method is not handling the input parameters correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The potential error location within the method is the condition that checks the type of the `value` parameter and tries to convert it to a `Timedelta` object. This conversion is leading to the `ValueError` because the method is expecting the input to be a compatible dtype or scalar, but certain types of input such as `np.datetime64` and `pd.Timestamp` are not being handled properly.

To fix this bug, the method needs to be updated to handle a wider range of input types appropriately. It should first check the type of the input and only perform conversion to a `Timedelta` object if the input is of a compatible type such as string, integer, float, timedelta, or convertible. For other types of input, it should raise a `TypeError` as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (str, int, float, np.timedelta64, pd.Timedelta)):
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")
    
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, float)):
        value = np.timedelta64(value, 'ns')
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value).to_timedelta64()
        
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

With this corrected implementation, the `searchsorted` method should now handle the input parameters appropriately and return the expected results without raising any `ValueError`.
