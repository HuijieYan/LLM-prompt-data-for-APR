The error in the `searchsorted` function seems to be related to incompatible input data types causing either a `ValueError` or `TypeError` to be raised instead of the expected `TypeError`. The error occurs when the `searchsorted` function is called with incompatible input types such as `int`, `int64`, `float`, `datetime64`, `Timestamp`, invalid string, `ndarray`, or `Period`. The current implementation does not handle these input types properly, which leads to the wrong exception being raised.

To fix this issue, the `searchsorted` function should be modified to handle the different input types correctly and ensure that a `TypeError` is raised when the input type is incompatible.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype='timedelta64[ns]', copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, np.int64, float)):
        value = np.array(np.timedelta64(int(value), 'ns'))
    else:
        # Handle other input types here and raise a TypeError if incompatible
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

With this correction, the different input types are properly handled, and a `TypeError` is raised for incompatible input types as expected. This should resolve the issues encountered in the test cases.
