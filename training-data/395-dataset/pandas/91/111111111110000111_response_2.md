The given error message clearly indicates that the searchsorted() method is failing to handle different data types such as integers, floats, datetimes, and periods, resulting in either a ValueError or a TypeError. This indicates a mismatch in data type handling in the searchsorted() method of the TimedeltaIndex class.

The root cause of the problem is that the searchsorted() method is not capable of handling the input data types such as integers, floats, datetimes, or periods. The method is expecting the input value to be a Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta, or convertible, and it cannot handle other data types gracefully, leading to unexpected errors.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to modify the searchsorted() method to handle different data types properly. Specifically, it should check the type of the 'value' parameter and convert it to an appropriate type (e.g., Timedelta) before performing the searchsorted operation.

However, given the complexity and specificity of the TimedeltaIndex and related classes in the pandas library, it is recommended to consult the pandas library documentation and release notes to ensure the correct approach for handling different data types in the searchsorted() method of the TimedeltaIndex class.

Here's the corrected code for the searchsorted() method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    # Convert the input value to the appropriate type if needed
    if not isinstance(value, (pd.Timedelta, str, int, float, pd.Timestamp)):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

This modification checks the type of the 'value' parameter, and if it's not one of the expected types, it converts it to a Timedelta object before performing the searchsorted operation. This should address the issues with different input data types and resolve the errors encountered in the test cases.
