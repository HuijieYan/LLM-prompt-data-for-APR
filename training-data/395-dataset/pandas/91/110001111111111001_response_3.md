The error occurs in the `searchsorted` function of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The function is supposed to find the indices where the specified value would be inserted in the sorted TimedeltaIndex. However, the function is not handling the input parameters correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior and error messages observed in the test cases.

The potential error location is where the function tries to convert the input value into a Timedelta object using the `Timedelta` constructor.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that the input value can always be directly converted into a Timedelta object. However, this assumption is not valid for all types of inputs, such as datetime64, float, etc. This leads to errors when incompatible input types are encountered.

To fix this bug, the function should check the type of the input value and then perform the appropriate conversion or operation based on the type. For example, if the value is an integer, it should be converted to a timedelta; if it's a datetime64, it should be converted to timedelta; and so on. This would ensure that the function handles various input types correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype="timedelta64[ns]", copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, np.integer, float, np.datetime64, pd.Timestamp, str)):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value).to_timedelta64()
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type for value")

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
