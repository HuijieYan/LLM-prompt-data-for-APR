The error message from the test function indicates that the `searchsorted` method is not behaving as expected and is not raising the correct exceptions. The error messages show that the method is not handling various input types correctly, leading to the wrong exceptions being raised.

Based on the test cases and error messages, it is evident that the bug is in the implementation of the `searchsorted` method. The method is not handling different input types properly, which is causing incorrect exceptions to be raised. This likely indicates that the function is not properly validating the input types before performing the search.

To fix this bug, the `searchsorted` method should perform input validation to ensure that the input `value` is of compatible types before conducting the search operation. Additionally, for invalid input types, appropriate exceptions should be raised as specified in the test cases.

Here's the corrected `searchsorted` method:

```python
# Corrected searchsorted method
@Substitution(klass="TimedeltaIndex")
@Appender(_shared_docs["searchsorted"])
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    # Perform input validation
    if not isinstance(value, (pd.Timedelta, str, int, float)):
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")

    # If input value is a Period, raise a ValueError
    if isinstance(value, pd.Period):
        raise ValueError("Value must be Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta or convertible, not Period")

    # Convert input value to Timedelta if necessary
    if not isinstance(value, pd.Timedelta):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value)

    # Perform the search operation using validated input
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
