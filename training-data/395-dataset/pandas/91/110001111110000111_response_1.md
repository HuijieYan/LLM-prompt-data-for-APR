The error message indicates that the function `searchsorted` in the file `timedeltas.py` is raising a `ValueError` when it should be raising a `TypeError` in certain cases, such as when the input `other` is of incompatible type.

The issue seems to be with the handling of incompatible input types in the `searchsorted` function. The function should be raising a `TypeError` when the input is not compatible, but it is incorrectly raising a `ValueError` instead.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to properly check for compatible input types and raise a `TypeError` when the input is not compatible.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")
    
    if not isinstance(value, pd.Timedelta):
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")

    value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected code, type checks are added to ensure that the input `value` is an instance of `pd.Timedelta`. If it's not, a `TypeError` is raised. This should resolve the issue where the function was incorrectly raising a `ValueError` and ensure that it correctly raises a `TypeError` when the input type is incompatible.
