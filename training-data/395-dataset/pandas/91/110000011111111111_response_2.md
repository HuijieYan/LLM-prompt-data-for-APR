The error message from the test cases indicates that the `searchsorted` function is not behaving as expected. The function should be able to handle different input types such as integers, floats, timedelta objects, and compatible arrays. The function is failing to handle these input types and is raising a `ValueError` instead of a `TypeError` for certain input types.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies in the conditional block where the input `value` is being transformed based on its type. The function has a conditional check to handle `np.ndarray` and `Index` separately, but it is not handling other input types such as integers, floats, and datetime64 objects properly.

To fix the issue, the `searchsorted` function should be modified to handle different input types correctly. It should check for the type of the `value` input and transform it accordingly to ensure compatibility with the `searchsorted` operation. Additionally, the function should raise a `TypeError` for unsupported input types instead of a `ValueError`.

Here's the corrected `searchsorted` function:

```python
@Substitution(klass="TimedeltaIndex")
@Appender(_shared_docs["searchsorted"])
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, np.int64, float, np.float64)):
        value = np.array([value], dtype='timedelta64[ns]')
    elif isinstance(value, np.datetime64):
        value = value.astype('timedelta64[ns]')
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported value type for searchsorted")

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

With these changes, the `searchsorted` function should be able to handle different input types and raise a `TypeError` for unsupported types, aligning with the requirements of the test cases.
