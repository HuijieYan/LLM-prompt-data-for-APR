The error message indicates that the `searchsorted` function is not behaving as expected. It is not raising the correct error in some cases, and in other cases, it is raising a `ValueError` when it should be raising a `TypeError`.

Looking at the code, it seems that the issue lies with how the function handles the `value` parameter. The function attempts to convert the `value` parameter into a `Timedelta` object and then perform some operations. However, the current approach is not handling different types of input correctly.

The bug occurs because the `searchsorted` function does not handle different types of input (int, float, ndarray, Timestamp, etc.) properly. The function is not able to handle these different types and raise the correct error when needed.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to handle different types of input appropriately and raise the correct `TypeError` in case of incompatible input types.

Here's the corrected version of the `searchsorted` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(klass="TimedeltaIndex")
@Appender(_shared_docs["searchsorted"])
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if not (
        isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index))
        or isinstance(value, (int, float, str, timedelta, Timestamp))
    ):
        raise TypeError(
            "searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar, not {}".format(type(value))
        )

    if not isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value)  # Use pd.Timedelta to handle different input types

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle different input types and raise a `TypeError` when needed. This should resolve the issues observed in the test cases.
