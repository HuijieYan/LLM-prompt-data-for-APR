The error seems to be occurring in the intersection method of the DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex class. The error messages indicate that the dtype attribute of the resulting index is different from the expected dtype, and that the freq attribute is None when it should match the freq attribute of the other index.

The intersection method should return an index with the same frequency as the original index. However, the implementation is not correctly handling cases where there is no overlap between the indices or when the indices have different time frequencies.

To fix this bug, the following changes can be made to the intersection method:
- Validate the frequency and dtype of the resulting index to match the input indices.
- Handle cases where there is no overlap between the indices by returning an empty index with the correct frequency.
- Correctly handle cases where the indices have different frequencies or time zones.

Here's the corrected version of the intersection method:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    # ... (existing code)

    # Validate the sort keyword argument
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)

    # Check if the indices are equal
    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    # Handle cases where there is no overlap
    if len(self) == 0 or len(other) == 0:
        return self._shallow_copy([])

    # Check if the other index is of the same type
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        return result

    # Handle cases where the indices have different frequencies or time zones
    if self.freq != other.freq or self.tz != other.tz:
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        return result

    # Find the overlapping range and create a new index
    start = max(self[0], other[0])
    end = min(self[-1], other[-1])
    if start > end:
        return self._shallow_copy([])

    overlap = self[(self >= start) & (self <= end)]
    return self._shallow_copy(overlap.values)
```

With these changes, the intersection method should now handle cases where there is no overlap between the indices and correctly handle different frequencies and time zones. Additionally, it ensures that the resulting index has the correct frequency and time zone.

This updated implementation should fix the bug and address the issues identified in the error messages.
