The error message indicates that the `freq` attribute of the result is not being set correctly. It should be set to the frequency of the second Index. This bug is most likely occurring due to incorrect conditional execution within the `intersection` method.

The potential error location is within the conditional blocks that handle the frequency setting within the `intersection` method.

The bug occurs because the conditional execution for setting the frequency is not properly considering different cases that involve DateTimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex, or PeriodIndex.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks should be revised to handle different types of indexes properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `intersection` method in the `DatetimeTimedeltaMixin` class:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.
        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0
        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1
           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0
           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    elif (
        other.freq is None
        or self.freq is None
        or other.freq != self.freq
        or (isinstance(other, DatetimeIndex) and not other.freq.is_anchored())
        or (isinstance(self, DatetimeIndex) and not self.freq.is_anchored())
        or (not self.is_monotonic or not other.is_monotonic)
    ):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

        # Invalidate the freq of `result`, which may not be correct at
        # this point, depending on the values.

        result._set_freq(None)
        result = self._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name)
        if result.freq is None:
            result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    # to make our life easier, "sort" the two ranges
    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:
        left, right = other, self

    # after sorting, the intersection always starts with the right index
    # and ends with the index of which the last elements is smallest
    end = min(left[-1], right[-1])
    start = right[0]

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        lslice = slice(*left.slice_locs(start, end))
        left_chunk = left.values[lslice]
        return self._shallow_copy(left_chunk)
```

The code now properly handles different types of indexes and properly sets the frequency based on the second index. This should resolve the issues highlighted in the test cases.
