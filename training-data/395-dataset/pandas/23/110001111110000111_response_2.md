The error messages indicate that the `freq` attribute of the `result` index is `None`, while the `freq` attribute of the other index `b` is a specific frequency (e.g., BusinessDay).

The bug in the intersection method is likely caused by the absence of a proper implementation for setting the frequency attribute of the resulting index. This bug causes the incorrect comparison of the `freq` attribute in the test cases, leading to assertion errors.

To fix this bug, the `freq` attribute of the resulting index should be properly set based on the input indices' frequencies.

Here's the corrected code for the `intersection` method:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    # existing implementation

    # to make our life easier, "sort" the two ranges
    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:
        left, right = other, self

    # existing implementation

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        lslice = slice(*left.slice_locs(start, end))
        left_chunk = left.values[lslice]
        
        # Set the frequency of the resulting index
        if isinstance(left, DatetimeIndex):
            freq = left.freq if left.freq is not None else "infer"
            return self._shallow_copy(left_chunk, name=self.name, freq=freq)
        else:
            return self._shallow_copy(left_chunk, name=self.name)
```

In this corrected code, the frequency of the resulting index `self` is set based on the frequency of the input `left` index. If `left` is a `DatetimeIndex` and has a frequency, the resulting index will inherit that frequency. Otherwise, the frequency is set to "infer" for the resulting index.

With this correction, the bug causing the wrong comparison of the frequency attribute and the resulting assertion errors should be fixed.
