The error message from the test functions indicates that the `freq` attribute of the result is not matching the `freq` attribute of the expected output in some cases. This inconsistency in frequency is leading to test failures.

The potential error within the `intersection` method is the incorrect handling of `freq` attribute comparison in some conditions, resulting in the inconsistency of the `freq` attribute of the result.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
- The comparison of `freq` attribute in the `intersection` method is not consistently implemented, leading to mismatches in output, especially when dealing with different time frequencies or custom business day frequencies.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
- Review the logic for frequency comparison in the `intersection` method and ensure that it correctly handles different time frequencies and custom business day frequencies.

The corrected code for the problematic `intersection` method is as follows:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    elif (other.freq is None
          or self.freq is None
          or other.freq != self.freq
          or not other.freq.is_anchored()
          or (not self.is_monotonic or not other.is_monotonic)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

        # Invalidate the freq of `result`, which may not be correct at
        # this point, depending on the values.

        result._set_freq(None)
        result = self._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name)
        if result.freq is None:
            result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    # to make our life easier, "sort" the two ranges
    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:
        left, right = other, self

    # after sorting, the intersection always starts with the right index
    # and ends with the index of which the last elements is smallest
    end = min(left[-1], right[-1])
    start = right[0]

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        lslice = slice(*left.slice_locs(start, end))
        left_chunk = left.values[lslice]
        return self._shallow_copy(left_chunk)
```

In this corrected version, the frequency comparison is handled appropriately, ensuring that the `freq` attribute of the result matches the expected output in various cases, thereby fixing the bug.
