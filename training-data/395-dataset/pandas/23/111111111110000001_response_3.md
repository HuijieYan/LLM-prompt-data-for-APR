The error with the `intersection` method seems to be related to the comparison of the `freq` attribute of the resulting index with the `freq` attribute of another index (the `b` index in the first test case and the `bdate_range` call in the second test case) which contains a frequency object. The error's cause is the `freq` attribute is `None` for the resulting index.

The potential error location is the `_shallow_copy` method which should copy the frequency attribute, but it might not be doing so correctly.

To fix this bug and prevent the `freq` attribute from being `None`, the `freq` should be properly passed to the `_shallow_copy` method when creating a shallow copy of the resulting index. Additionally, the `freq` attribute should be properly inherited from the input indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `intersection` method:

```python
# Updated function code
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    ... (omitted description) ...

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    elif (
        other.freq is None
        or self.freq is None
        or other.freq != self.freq
        or not other.freq.is_anchored()
        or (not self.is_monotonic or not other.is_monotonic)
    ):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

        # Invalidate the freq of `result`, which may not be correct at
        # this point, depending on the values.

        result._set_freq(None)
        result = self._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name, freq=self.freq)  # Pass the freq attribute
        if result.freq is None:
            result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    # ... (omitted code) ...

```

In this corrected version, the `freq` attribute is explicitly passed to the `_shallow_copy` method when creating a shallow copy of the resulting index, and additional inheritance of the `freq` attribute from the input indices is provided. These modifications should help fix the bug, and the tests shouldn't produce assertion errors anymore.
