The error message indicates that there is a comparison between the frequency of the result and the frequency of `b`, but the result has a `None` value for its frequency. This suggests that the bug may be occurring in the calculation of the frequency for the `intersection` function in the `DatetimeTimedeltaMixin` class.

The possible reason for this bug is that the frequency is not being set correctly within the `intersection` method. As `result.freq` is expected to have a value, the bug might be related to how the frequency is determined or assigned within the `intersection` method.

To fix this bug, the relevant section of the `intersection` method should be reviewed. It might be necessary to refactor the logic for setting the frequency to ensure that it correctly identifies and assigns the frequency for the result.

Here's the corrected version of the `intersection` method:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            return result

    elif (
        other.freq is None
        or self.freq is None
        or other.freq != self.freq
        or not other.freq.is_anchored()
        or (not self.is_monotonic or not other.is_monotonic)
    ):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        result._set_freq(None)
        result = self._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name)
        return result

    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:
        left, right = other, self

    end = min(left[-1], right[-1])
    start = right[0]

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        lslice = slice(*left.slice_locs(start, end))
        left_chunk = left.values[lslice]
        return self._shallow_copy(left_chunk)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the frequency of the result is correctly identified and assigned based on the conditions specified. This should resolve the issue of the frequency being `None` in the result.
