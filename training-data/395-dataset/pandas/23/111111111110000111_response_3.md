The error seems to be occurring in the `test_intersection` method. The assertions `assert_attr_equal("dtype", l, r, obj=obj)` are failing because the dtype of the left and right sides are different for the DatetimeIndex. The issue seems to be with handling the intersection for the datetime index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is with the handling of frequency (`freq`) and the equality check `assert result.freq == rng.freq`.

The bug might be occurring due to the way the `freq` attribute is being handled in the `intersection` function. It seems the `freq` attribute is not being set correctly in the output of the `intersection` method.

To fix the bug, it might be necessary to ensure that the `freq` attribute is being preserved or set correctly in the output of the `intersection` method. This could involve making adjustments to how the frequency is handled during the intersection operation.

Here's the corrected function for the problematic method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
            from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)) and self.freq is not None:
            result._set_freq(self.freq)
        return result

    ):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:

    # after sorting, the intersection always starts with the right index
    # and ends with the index of which the last elements is smallest
    end = min(left[-1], right[-1])
