The potential error in the given function is at the line `if not isinstance(other, type(self)):`. This line is checking if `other` is not an instance of the same type as `self`, which may cause issues.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks the type of `other` against the type of `self`. This can lead to incorrect behavior if `other` is not an exact instance of `self` but still should be handled in a similar way.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition to check if `other` is an instance of `DatetimeTimedeltaMixin` (the type that `self` is an instance of) or its subclasses, instead of checking if `other` is an instance of the concrete type `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the `intersection` function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)) and not isinstance(self, type(other)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    elif (
        other.freq is None

        or not other.freq.is_anchored()
        or (not self.is_monotonic or not other.is_monotonic)
    ):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:

    # after sorting, the intersection always starts with the right index
