The error messages indicate that there are issues with the comparison of the `freq` attribute in the `intersection` method. The comparison is failing because one of the objects has a `None` value for the `freq` attribute and the other has a specific frequency value (e.g., `<BusinessDay>` or `<CustomBusinessDay>`).

The bug in the `intersection` method is due to the fact that the `freq` attribute is not being set properly in certain cases. The function should ensure that the `freq` attribute is maintained correctly when performing the intersection.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the `intersection` method to correctly set the `freq` attribute when creating the intersection result.
2. Add logic to handle the cases where the `freq` of the intersection should be maintained from one of the input ranges.

Here is the corrected code for the `intersection` method:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    elif (
        other.freq is None
        or self.freq is None
        or other.freq != self.freq
        or not other.freq.is_anchored()
        or (not self.is_monotonic or not other.is_monotonic)
    ):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

        # Invalidate the freq of `result`, which may not be correct at
        # this point, depending on the values.

        result._set_freq(None)
        result = self._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name)
        if result.freq is None:
            result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    # Maintain the freq attribute from one of the input ranges
    result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
    # Preserve the freq of `result` from `self` if `other` has a None freq
    if other.freq is None:
        result._set_freq(self.freq)
    return result
```

With these changes, the `intersection` method should maintain the correct `freq` attribute when creating the intersection and handle the corresponding comparisons properly.
