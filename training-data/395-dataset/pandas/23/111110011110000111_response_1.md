The error occurs in the `intersection` function of the `DatetimeTimedeltaMixin` class. The error is due to the incorrect comparison of frequencies of the result and the other index in the test cases.

The reason for the bug is that the `intersection` function is not correctly handling the comparison of frequencies between the result and the other index. This results in `None` being compared with the frequency object, leading to the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the frequency comparison between the result and the other index is handled correctly. The correct frequency comparison logic should be implemented to resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `intersection` function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
        """
        Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

        May be much faster than Index.intersection

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : Same type as self or array-like
        sort : False or None, default False
            Sort the resulting index if possible.

            .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

            .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

               Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
               from before 0.24.0.

            .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

               The `sort` keyword is added

        Returns
        -------
        y : Index or same type as self
        """
        self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
        self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

        if self.equals(other):
            return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

        if len(self) == 0:
            return self.copy()
        if len(other) == 0:
            return other.copy()

        if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
            result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
            if isinstance(result, type(self)):
                if result.freq is None:
                    result.freq = getattr(other, "freq", None)  # Set the frequency of result
            return result

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...

``` 

With this correction, the frequency comparison issue between the result and the other index will be resolved. This should eliminate the assertion errors observed in the test cases.
