The error message indicates that there is an issue with the frequency comparison in the `intersection` function of the DatetimeTimedeltaMixin class. The error is caused by the incorrect handling of comparing frequencies of the datetime index.

The potential error location within the function is the comparison of frequencies `assert result.freq == b.freq`. This comparison is causing the assertion to fail, indicating a bug in the frequency comparison logic.

To fix the bug, the comparison of frequencies should be adjusted to handle the different types of frequencies correctly. Instead of a direct comparison, a proper comparison method or logic should be used to compare the frequencies.

The corrected code for the `intersection` function is as follows:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    elif other.freq is None or self.freq is None or other.freq != self.freq:
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

        # Invalidate the freq of `result`, which may not be correct at
        # this point, depending on the values.
        result._set_freq(None)
        result = self._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name)
        if result.freq is None:
            result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    # to make our life easier, "sort" the two ranges
    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:
        left, right = other, self

    # after sorting, the intersection always starts with the right index
    # and ends with the index of which the last elements is smallest
    end = min(left[-1], right[-1])
    start = right[0]

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        lslice = slice(*left.slice_locs(start, end))
        left_chunk = left.values[lslice]
        return self._shallow_copy(left_chunk)
```

In the corrected code, the frequency comparison logic has been adjusted to handle different types of frequencies correctly.
