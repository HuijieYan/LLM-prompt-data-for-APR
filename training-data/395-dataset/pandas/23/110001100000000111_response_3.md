The potential error in the provided function is related to the comparison and intersection of two datetime indexes. The bug seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the intersection logic, especially when dealing with the frequency attributes of the indexes.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to carefully check the conditions for intersection and implement the logic to correctly handle the frequency and sorted nature of the datetime indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    elif (
        other.freq is None
        or self.freq is None
        or other.freq != self.freq
        or not other.freq.is_anchored()
        or (not self.is_monotonic or not other.is_monotonic)
    ):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

        # Invalidate the freq of `result`, which may not be correct at
        # this point, depending on the values.

        result._set_freq(None)
        result = result._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name)
        if result.freq is None:
            result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    # to make our life easier, "sort" the two ranges
    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:
        left, right = other, self

    # after sorting, the intersection always starts with the right index
    # and ends with the index of which the last elements is smallest
    end = pd.Timestamp(min(left[-1], right[-1]))
    start = pd.Timestamp(right[0])

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        lslice = slice(*left.slice_locs(start, end))
        left_chunk = left.values[lslice]
        return type(self)(data=left_chunk)
```

In the updated code, the logic for sorting, identifying the intersection, and handling frequency attributes has been revised to ensure correct behavior when performing the intersection operation on datetime indexes. Additionally, the function now returns an index object of the appropriate type for the intersection result.
