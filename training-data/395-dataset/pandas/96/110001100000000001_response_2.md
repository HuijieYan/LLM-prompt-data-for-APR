Based on the given code, the buggy function seems to be `apply(self, other)`. The error in this code is likely to occur due to the following reasons:

1. The function `isinstance(other, datetime)` is called without importing the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module and use it in the `isinstance` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
        pass
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
