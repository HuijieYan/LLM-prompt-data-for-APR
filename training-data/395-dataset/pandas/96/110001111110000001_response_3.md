The error message indicates that there is an issue with the frequency validation when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset in the `pd.date_range` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `apply` function. It seems that the calculation and adjustment of business hours within this function are not correctly handling the custom business hours specified in the test case.

The bug is occurring because the `apply` function is not properly handling the custom business hours, leading to an incorrect frequency being inferred from the passed values.

To fix the bug, the `apply` function should be modified to correctly handle the custom business hours and ensure that the frequency is properly calculated when using the `CustomBusinessHour` offset.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_other = other

        # Handle positive and negative offsets
        if n >= 0:
            # If the time is not in the specified end time or the specified offset, adjust to the next opening time
            if other.time() not in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                adjusted_other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_other)

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # Adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self._next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                adjusted_other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                adjusted_other = other + skip_bd

        # Remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_other)) - adjusted_other
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    adjusted_other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    adjusted_other = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other) - adjusted_other
                if bhour_remain > bhour:
                    adjusted_other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    adjusted_other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(adjusted_other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return adjusted_other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
