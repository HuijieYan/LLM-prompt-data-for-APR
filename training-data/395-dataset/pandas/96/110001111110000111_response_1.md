The error occurs in the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` when using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays. The error message indicates a problem with validating the frequency of the resulting date range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `apply` method where the logic for adjusting the business hours is implemented. The issue might be related to how the method handles holidays and adjusts the date based on the business hours and the specified frequency.

The bug occurs because the `apply` method fails to properly adjust the date range when holidays are specified, causing the resulting date range to have more periods than expected due to incorrect adjustments for holidays.

To fix the bug, the `apply` method should be modified to correctly handle holidays and adjust the date range based on the business hours and the specified frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` method:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (omitted previous logic) ...

        # check if the date is a holiday
        if other.date() in self.holidays:
            # move to next business day
            other = self.next_bday()

        # rest of the previous logic for adjusting business hours
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to see if the date is a holiday, and if so, moved to the next business day using the `next_bday` method.

This correction should address the issue related to using `pd.date_range` with a custom business hour frequency and holidays, preventing the resulting date range from having more periods than expected.
