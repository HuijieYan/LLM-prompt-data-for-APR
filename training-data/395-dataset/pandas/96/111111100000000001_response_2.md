The potential error in the `apply` function is that it is using the `datetime` class without importing it. Also, it is referencing `BusinessDay` without importing it as well.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the `datetime` class and `BusinessDay` before using them in the function.
2. Ensure that the code logic is correct and handles all possible cases.

Here's the corrected code with the imports and potential logic adjustments:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay

# ... (other functions)

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # (rest of the code remains the same)
        # (import BusinessDay and other necessary imports)

        if not self.is_on_offset(other):  # replaced self.next_bday.is_on_offset with self.is_on_offset
            prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
            remain = other - prev_open
            other = prev_open + BusinessDay() + remain
        else:
            other = other + BusinessDay()

        # (rest of the code remains the same)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
