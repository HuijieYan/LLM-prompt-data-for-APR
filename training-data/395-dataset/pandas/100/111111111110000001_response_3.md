The problematic function `pct_change` in the class `NDFrame` is resulting in assertion errors when the test function `test_pct_change_with_duplicated_indices` is executed with different fill methods like "pad", "ffill", or None. The function seems to be incorrectly calculating the percentage change in values and is not producing the expected output.

The main reason behind the bug is that the function `pct_change` is not implementing the percentage change calculation correctly. It also incorrectly uses the `isna` function without the appropriate prefix. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the `pct_change` function so that it correctly calculates the percentage change and handles the fill methods.

Below is the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=None, method=fill_method, axis=axis, limit=limit, downcast=None, inplace=False)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis), axis='index', level=None, fill_value=None) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna().values
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly calculate the percentage change and work as expected when different fill methods are provided in the test function.
