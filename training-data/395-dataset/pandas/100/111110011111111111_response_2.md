The bug is occurring in the `pct_change` method of the `NDFrame` class. The issue is that when `fill_method` is set to `None`, it fails to work properly when the method is chained with the `groupby` method.

The potential error location is within the logic handling the `fill_method`. When `fill_method` is set to `None`, it fails to handle the execution when chained with the `groupby` method.

The reason behind the bug is that the code for the `pct_change` method does not handle the case of a `fill_method` value of `None` when the method is chained with the `groupby` method.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the `pct_change` method to handle the `fill_method` value of `None` properly, especially when it is used in conjunction with the `groupby` method. The modification involves adding logic to handle the `None` value for `fill_method` and ensure that the method works correctly in all scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna().values
        rs[mask] = np.nan
    return rs
```

With this modification, the `pct_change` method should be able to handle the `fill_method` value of `None` and work correctly even when chained with the `groupby` method.
