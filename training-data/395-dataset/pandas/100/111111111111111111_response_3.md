The bug is in the "pct_change" method, and it seems to be related to the calculation with duplicated indices. The "pct_change" method should handle the duplicated indices properly, but the current code does not handle it correctly.

The error message states that the DataFrame.iloc[:, 0] values are different, indicating that the calculation with duplicated indices is not producing the expected results.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to re-implement the "pct_change" method to properly handle the duplicated indices. The logic for the calculation should consider the duplicated indices case and perform the calculations accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the "pct_change" method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(data.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

This code properly handles the case of duplicated indices and should produce the expected results, resolving the bug in the "pct_change" method.
