The buggy function in question is the `pct_change` method. It seems that the error message is related to the comparison of expected and actual results, which indicates that the `pct_change` method is not producing the expected output.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems like there are several potential causes of the bug:
1. The computation of `rs` (the percentage change) might not be correct.
2. The subsequent operations on `rs`, such as removing duplicate indices and reindexing, might be incorrect. 
3. The handling of `fill_method` during the percentage change calculation may need to be adjusted.

To fix the bug, the following steps could be considered:
1. Verify the computation of `rs` to ensure it correctly calculates the percentage change over the specified `periods`.
2. Verify the subsequent operations on `rs` such as removing duplicate indices and reindexing.
3. Double-check the handling of `fill_method` to ensure it is applied correctly in the context of percentage change calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # Compute the percentage change over the specified periods
    data = self.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=0, fill_value=None)
    
    if fill_method is not None:
        data.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, inplace=True, axis=0)
    
    rs = (self - data) / data
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, we directly compute the percentage change by subtracting the shifted data from the original data and then dividing by the shifted data. This should produce the correct percentage change without the need for additional operations on the result.
