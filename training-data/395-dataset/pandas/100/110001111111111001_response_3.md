The bug seems to be located in the `pct_change` method of the `DataFrame` class. This method is used to calculate the percentage change between the current and a prior element.

Upon analyzing the input parameter values and the expected values from the test case, the bug appears to be in the calculation and handling of the `rs` DataFrame, specifically how it is being populated with values and adjusted based on the fill method.

The error message from the test function indicates a discrepancy in the calculated percentage changes for the first column of the result. This likely means that the computation of the percentage change is incorrect in the original `pct_change` method.

To fix this bug, the calculation of the percentage change should be revised in the `pct_change` method to ensure the correct computation of the percentage change values. Additionally, the adjustment based on the fill method should be carefully implemented to ensure the correct handling of the `rs` DataFrame.

Here is the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    if periods > 1:
        data = data.div(data.shift(periods=1, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    else:
        data = (data / data.shift(periods=1, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1

    if fill_method is not None:
        data.dropna(inplace=True)  # Drop rows with NaN resulting from the pct_change calculation

    return data.reindex(self.index)
```

The corrected code specifically addresses the calculation of the percentage change and adjusts it based on the fill method if specified. Also, after the calculation, it drops rows with NaN resulting from the pct_change calculation when the fill_method is not None.

By addressing these issues, the corrected `pct_change` method should produce the expected results in the test case and avoid the reported AssertionError.
