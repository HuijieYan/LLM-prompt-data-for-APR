The error occurs when using the `pct_change` function with groupby, specifically when `fill_method` is set to None. This results in a TypeError during the execution of the function. The root cause of the bug is likely the usage of fill method within the pct_change function, which is applied when fill_method is not explicitly specified.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the pct_change function to handle the case where fill_method is None. This can be achieved by explicitly checking for None and then setting the data variable accordingly.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna().values
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
