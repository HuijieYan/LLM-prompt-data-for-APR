The buggy function `pct_change` is supposed to calculate the percentage change between the current and a prior element. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the percentage change, resulting in incorrect values when the `fill_method` parameter is used.

The error message indicates a difference in the resulting percentage change values, even though the expected and actual values should be the same.

Upon analyzing the `pct_change` function, the potential location of the bug is in the `rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1` line. It seems that the subtraction by 1 might result in incorrect values, especially when using methods to fill missing values.

The approach to fix the bug could be to review the formula for calculating the percentage change and ensure that the `fill_method` handling is correctly implemented.

The corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        
    prev_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = (data - prev_data) / prev_data

    if freq is None:
        mask = data.isna()
        rs[mask] = np.nan
    
    return rs
```
In this corrected code, the formula `(data - prev_data) / prev_data` is used to calculate the percentage change. Additionally, handling of NaN values is improved.
