The error seems to be related to the `pct_change` method of a DataFrame failing the test cases. It appears that the `pct_change` method is not returning the expected results.

The potential error in the `pct_change` method is the calculation of `rs` using `data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1`. The `shift` method might not be used correctly, leading to incorrect percentage change calculations.

The bug is occurring because the `fill_method` provided in the test case is not being properly handled in the `pct_change` method. This is causing the method to produce unexpected results when compared with the expected values.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the `fill_method` is correctly applied in the `pct_change` method, using it as intended to calculate the percentage change.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
# Corrected pct_change method
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    if periods == 1:
        rs = (data / data.shift(1, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    else:
        rs = (data / data.shift(periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1

    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)

    return rs
```

By using the correct `shift` method and adjusting the logic depending on the value of `periods`, this should address the bug in the `pct_change` method.
