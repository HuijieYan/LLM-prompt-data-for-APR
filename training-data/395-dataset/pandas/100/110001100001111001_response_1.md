The bug occurs in the `pct_change` method. The issue lies in the line where the `axis` variable is defined. The original code reads `axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))`. Here, the `_get_axis_number` method is being called from the class `cls`, which would require the method to be defined as a class method with `cls` as the first argument. Additionally, there is no such `_stat_axis_name` attribute present. 

Furthermore, the function appears to have issues with the `fillna` method and the calculation of the `rs` variable. There seems to be an incorrect calculation of the `rs` variable by dividing `data` by the shifted `data`, and due to missing values, the following lines are also affected.

To correct the function:
1. Define the `_get_axis_number` function as a class method by using the `@classmethod` decorator and replacing the `cls` parameter with `self` to avoid any confusion.
2. Update the `axis` assignment by using the correct attribute for axis or parameter of the method. 
3. Modify the calculation of `rs` to perform the division correctly, using the `div` method, and reindex based on that data.
4. Handle the missing values properly by checking them and putting masks accordingly.
5. Ensure that the mask and rs values are placed in the correct position based on the data.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
# Corrected method
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(self._stat_axis_name)
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    # Handling missing values
    mask = data.isna()
    rs[mask] = np.nan
    
    return rs
```
