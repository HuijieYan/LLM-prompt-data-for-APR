The error occurs during the `assert_frame_equal` in the test function. The `pct_change` function is expected to calculate the percentage change between rows in the DataFrame. The error is because the calculated result doesn't match the expected result.

The bug is in the computation of the `pct_change` function. The issue is most likely related to the calculation of the percentage change (rs) in the `pct_change` function. It seems that the calculations are not being performed correctly, leading to the mismatch between expected and actual results.

To fix the bug in the `pct_change` function, you can revise the computation of the percentage change and ensure that the calculations are properly carried out. The calculations should take into account the differences between consecutive values for each column.

Here's the corrected `pct_change` function:
```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shift_periods_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = (data - shift_periods_data) / shift_periods_data
    rs = rs.dropna()
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
  
    return rs
```
In the corrected `pct_change` function, the percentage change is calculated by taking the difference between consecutive values and then dividing by the previous value. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the percentage change is accurately calculated.
