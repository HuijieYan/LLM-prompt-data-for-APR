Potential Error Location: The potential error occurs in the `pct_change` function when the `fill_method` parameter is set to None and used in conjunction with the `groupby` operation.

Reasons for Bug: The bug occurs because the `pct_change` function is calling a method using the `getattr` function with the `fill_method` parameter, which is not a string but is set to None.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: To fix this bug, we need to modify the `pct_change` function to handle the case where `fill_method` is None and refactor the code to avoid using `getattr` with `fill_method` when it is set to None.

Corrected Code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_100/pandas/core/generic.py

# signature of a relative function in this class
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = data.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the `pct_change` function has been modified to handle the case when `fill_method` is None. The `getattr` call has been replaced with direct method calls, and the error-prone code has been refactored to avoid the bug encountered with the `groupby` operation.
