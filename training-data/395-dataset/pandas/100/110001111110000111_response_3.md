The "pct_change" function has a bug that causes it to produce incorrect results when the "fill_method" parameter is set to None. The issue arises when the function is called with groupby, resulting in a TypeError. The error message indicates the problem is related to how the "fill_method" attribute is handled.

Upon analysis, it appears that the bug in the "pct_change" function is caused by the handling of the "fill_method" parameter. When using groupby, the "fill_method" attribute is not being handled properly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the "pct_change" function should be modified to properly handle the "fill_method" parameter and its interaction with groupby operations.

The following refactored "pct_change" function addresses the bug and provides a corrected implementation:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=None, method=fill_method, axis=axis, limit=limit, downcast=None)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
    return rs
``` 

The changes include adjusting the "fillna" method call with proper parameter names and handling the "mask" operation at the end using "isna" instead of "com.values_from_object(data)" and "np.putmask".

After integrating these modifications, the "pct_change" function should be able to handle the "fill_method" parameter correctly, both with and without groupby operations, resolving the bug.
