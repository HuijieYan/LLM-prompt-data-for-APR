The bug in the provided `pct_change` method seems to be occurring due to incorrect variable references and method invocations.

The `pct_change` method is trying to retrieve the axis number by using the `self._get_axis_number` method, which is not the correct approach. The correct way to get the axis number should be using the `self._get_axis_number` method directly without calling it on `self`.

Additionally, the `isna` and `values_from_object` functions are being used directly without proper references, which could be causing the method to fail.

Finally, there are some issues with the `rs` DataFrame operations. The 'loc' operation and reindexing might not be necessary or can be causing issues. 

To fix the bug, an updated version of the `pct_change` method is provided below:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(self._stat_axis_name)
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    mask = data.isna()
    rs[mask] = np.nan
    return rs
```

In this updated method, the axis number is retrieved using `self._get_axis_number` directly, proper `fillna` method invocation has been used, and the use of `isna` and handling of masking has been corrected.

This updated method should address the issues observed in the buggy method and produce the expected results mentioned in the test cases.
