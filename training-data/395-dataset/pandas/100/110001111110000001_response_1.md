The error messages are not specific about the root cause of the issue. However, by tracking the core method and the error message, it seems like the bug is related to the calculation of percentage change.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of percentage change (`rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1`). 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the algorithm for calculating percentage change is incorrect or incomplete.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of percentage change is accurately handled. The correct method for calculating percentage change should involve shifting the data as well as taking the difference and dividing by the original value.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        
    # shift the data by the specified periods
    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    
    # calculate the percentage change
    rs = (data - shifted_data) / shifted_data
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
This corrected code addresses the issues with the calculation of percentage change and should resolve the bug.
