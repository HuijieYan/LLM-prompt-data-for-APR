The error is occurring due to incorrect calculations in the `pct_change` method when the fill_method is set to None. The calculations using this method are causing unexpected results for the DataFrame with duplicated indices, which is not handled properly.

To fix the bug, the pct_change method should be updated to handle the case when fill_method is None and the DataFrame has duplicated indices. The results should be calculated correctly by accounting for these edge cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(self._stat_axis_name)
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated(keep='first')]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    mask = rs.isna().values
    rs.values[mask] = np.nan
    return rs
```

This updated implementation should handle the case when fill_method is None and give the expected results for the test cases provided.
