The issue seems to be caused by the `pct_change` function when used with groupby and `fill_method=None`, which is leading to the TypeError and ValueError.

Based on the provided test case and error message, the potential error location lies within the `pct_change` function when `fill_method` is set to None.

The probable reason for the bug is that the `pct_change` function does not handle the case where `fill_method` is None when the function is called within a groupby operation. This leads to the errors mentioned in the issue description.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to modify the `pct_change` function to handle the case when `fill_method` is None, especially within a groupby operation. This can involve creating a conditional check to handle the None case separately.

Below is the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        if self._selected_obj.ndim != 1 and limit is None:
            raise ValueError("The limit cannot be None when the data is not 1-dimensional")
        elif self._selected_obj.ndim == 1:
            limit = 0
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code:
- A conditional check has been added to handle the case where `fill_method` is None, especially when the data is not 1-dimensional and the limit is not specified.
- If the `fill_method` is None and the data is not 1-dimensional, it will raise a ValueError if the limit is not specified.
- If the `fill_method` is None and the data is 1-dimensional, it will set the limit to 0.
- Otherwise, the previous implementation for handling the `fill_method` has been retained.

This should address the bug and enable the `pct_change` function to work correctly, including when used with groupby operations and different `fill_method` settings.
