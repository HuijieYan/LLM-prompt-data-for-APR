The bug in the code arises from the `self.fillna` method, which is being called with the `method` parameter in the `pct_change` method. The expected behavior is for the `fillna` method to be called without specifying the `method` parameter. This inconsistency is causing the `PeriodIndexError` that we see in the error messages.

To fix this bug, the `pct_change` method should be updated to call the `fillna` method in the suggested manner. Additionally, the logic for replacing `NaN` values in the resulting `rs` dataframe could also be revisited.

Below is the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit)
    
    # Applying pct_change calculation
    rs = (data - data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis)) / data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis)
    
    # Reindexing
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.where(~mask, np.nan)
    
    return rs
```

By replacing `fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)` with `fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit)` and updating the pct_change calculation, we can address the bug and provide the expected behavior for the `pct_change` method.

This will fix the errors observed in the test cases and the associated GitHub issue.
