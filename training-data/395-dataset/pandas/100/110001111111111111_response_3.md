The bug in the `pct_change` method seems to be related to the calculation of the percentage change in a DataFrame. The function calculates the percentage change between the current and a prior element by default. However, when using the `groupby` function, it seems to run into issues with the `fill_method=None` parameter.

One potential error location seems to be in the code block where the function attempts to get the fill method from the self object. The `getattr(self, fill_method)(limit=limit)` line seems to be causing the TypeError when executed with `fill_method=None`.

The reason behind the bug could be that the code is unable to handle the scenario when `fill_method` is set to None, especially in the context of using the `groupby` function. This results in a TypeError as it cannot correctly handle the value `None` when calling `getattr`.

To fix the bug, the code block responsible for handling the fill method should be adjusted to account for the case when `fill_method=None`. One approach could be to add a condition to handle `None` explicitly by using a different approach to fill the missing values in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:  # Handle special case where fill_method is None
        data = self.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In this correction, a separate condition is added to handle the case when `fill_method` is set to `None`. The `shift` method is used to fill the missing values in this case.

After making this modification, the `pct_change` method should be able to handle the `None` fill method and also integrate with the `groupby` function without encountering the TypeError.
