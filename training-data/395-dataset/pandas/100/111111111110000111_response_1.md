The pct_change function appears to be causing the error. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the values when the fill_method is set to None. It seems that the pct_change method does not handle the None value for the fill_method correctly.

The reason behind the bug is that the pct_change method does not handle the fill_method=None case properly. This was observed when the test function was being run with fill_method='pad', 'ffill' and None, resulting in errors in each case.

To fix this bug, the pct_change method needs to be modified to handle the fill_method=None case properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        rs = self.diff(periods=periods, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    return rs
```

With this corrected code, the pct_change method should handle the fill_method=None case properly and fix the bug that causes errors when running the test function.
