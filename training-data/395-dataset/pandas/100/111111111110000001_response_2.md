The error message indicates that the DataFrame values are different and shows the specific mismatched values. This suggests that the `pct_change` function is not producing the expected output.

The bug appears to be in the `pct_change` function, primarily in the lines that calculate `rs` and then reindex it.

The reason for the bug is that the `reindex_like` method used in the pct_change function is incorrectly reindexing the `rs` DataFrame. This leads to unexpected values and eventually causing the test functions to fail.

To fix the bug, the code for the `pct_change` function needs to be updated. Specifically, the way `rs` is reindexed should be corrected to produce the desired results.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, inplace=False, axis=axis)
        
    rs = (data - data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) / data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    mask = data.isna().values
    rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
    
    return rs
```

This corrected function calculates the percentage change accurately and handles NaN values appropriately, addressing the issues raised in the test functions.
