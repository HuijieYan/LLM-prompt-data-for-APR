There seems to be an issue with the dtype compatibility check in the `_can_use_numexpr` function. The function checks for dtype compatibility between the input arrays `a` and `b`, and then returns a boolean based on the result of this check. The dtype compatibility check involves checking if the values of `dtype_check` are present in `_ALLOWED_DTYPES`.

The issue appears to be with the logic of dtype compatibility check. The current logic is not handling the dtype_check and the allowed dtypes properly.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the logic for dtype compatibility check. We should compare the dtypes of the input arrays (`a` and `b`) and match it with the allowed dtypes defined in `_ALLOWED_DTYPES`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None and np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
        if hasattr(a, "dtypes") and hasattr(b, "dtypes"):
            a_dtype = a.dtypes.astype(str).iloc[0]
            b_dtype = b.dtypes.astype(str).iloc[0]
            if dtype_check in _ALLOWED_DTYPES and _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= {a_dtype, b_dtype}:
                return True
    return False
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `a` and `b` have the attribute "dtypes". If they do, we extract the dtype of the elements and then compare these dtypes with the allowed dtypes. If they match, we return `True` indicating that numexpr can be used. If they don't match, we return `False`. This ensures that dtype compatibility is properly checked.
