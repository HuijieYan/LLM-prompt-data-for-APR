The error in the given function `_can_use_numexpr` arises from the line `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()` which is trying to call the `value_counts()` method on a NumPy dtype object. This method is only available for pandas Series, not for NumPy dtype objects.

The code is trying to check for compatibility of dtypes between `a` and `b` using `value_counts()` method, which is resulting in an AttributeError. The error occurs because `o` refers to a NumPy dtype object, which doesn't have the `value_counts()` method.

To fix this issue, we should check for the type of `o` before using the `value_counts()` method. If `o` is a pandas Series, then we can use the `value_counts()` method, otherwise, we should handle NumPy dtypes differently.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes
                    if hasattr(s, "value_counts"):
                        s_counts = s.value_counts()
                        if len(s_counts) > 1:
                            return False
                        dtypes |= set(s_counts.index.astype(str))
                    elif hasattr(o, "dtype"):
                        dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the object `o` has the attribute `dtypes`. If it does, we proceed to check if `s` (the dtypes of `o`) has the `value_counts()` method. If so, we use it to count the unique values and check for dtype compatibility. If `s` doesn't have the `value_counts()` method, we fallback to the dtypes object itself and retrieve the dtype names. If `o` is a NumPy array, we extract the dtype and add it to the set of dtypes.

This corrected function should handle both pandas Series and NumPy arrays without raising any attribute errors.
