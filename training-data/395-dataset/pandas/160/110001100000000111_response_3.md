The error is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function. The function attempts to use the `value_counts` method on the `dtypes` attribute of the Series object, but the `numpy.dtype` object does not have a `value_counts` method.

The error is happening because the `value_counts` method is attempted to be called on a `numpy.dtype` object, which doesn't have that method. This discrepancy is likely due to changes in the pandas library, specifically a PR that made `get_dtype_counts` deprecated and caused this regression.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to use the `get_dtype_counts` method instead of `value_counts` for checking dtype compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.get_dtype_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```
