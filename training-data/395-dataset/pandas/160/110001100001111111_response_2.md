The bug in the function `_can_use_numexpr` seems to be related to the check for dtype compatibility when performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series. In the buggy function, the error occurs at line 73 where it attempts to use `value_counts()` after checking for the existence of the `dtypes` attribute.

The issue seems to arise from the change in behavior between older and newer versions of pandas, specifically from pandas 0.19.2 to 0.25. The function `_can_use_numexpr` used to call `get_dtype_counts()` which has been deprecated and replaced with `value_counts()` in newer versions. This change has caused a regression as a Series now only returns a single numpy dtype which does not have a `value_counts()` method.

A possible approach to fix this bug would be to check for the `get_dtype_counts()` method first and if it doesn't exist, fallback to checking for the `dtypes` attribute and then using a different method or property to determine the dtype compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
import numpy as np

_MIN_ELEMENTS = 1000  # Define the minimum elements threshold as an example

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, 'get_dtype_counts'):
                    s = o.get_dtype_counts()
                elif hasattr(o, 'dtypes'):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                else:
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}
                if len(s) > 1:
                    return False
                dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In the corrected code, we first check for the `get_dtype_counts()` method and use it if available. If not, we then check for the `dtypes` attribute and use `value_counts()`. If neither method is available, we fallback to directly checking the dtype of the object.

This updated approach should cater to both older and newer versions of pandas, ensuring that dtype compatibility is correctly determined when performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series.
