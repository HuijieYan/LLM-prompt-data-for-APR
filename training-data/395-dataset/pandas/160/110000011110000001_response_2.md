The error occurs in the `_can_use_numexpr` function. The reason behind this error is that the function is trying to access the `value_counts` attribute on the `dtypes` object, which leads to an AttributeError because `numpy.dtype` objects do not have a `value_counts` attribute.

In this case, it seems the intention is to check for dtype compatibility, but the current implementation is incorrect. To fix this, we need to revise the logic of dtype compatibility checking.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to check if the dtypes of the input arrays (`a` and `b`) are the same. If they are the same, it indicates dtype compatibility. We can also simplify the condition by directly comparing the dtypes of `a` and `b`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            if a.dtype == b.dtype:
                return True

    return False
```

With this revised logic, the function will return `True` only if the dtypes of the input arrays are the same, indicating dtype compatibility.
