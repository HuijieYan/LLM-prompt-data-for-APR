The issue seems to be related to a change in the implementation of `_can_use_numexpr` between pandas 0.19.2 and 0.25. The issue occurs when performing operations between a large DataFrame and a Series, causing the `_can_use_numexpr` function to throw an AttributeError.

### Analysis of the Issue
- The error occurs in the `_can_use_numexpr` function, specifically in the line where it tries to access `value_counts()` of the `dtypes`.
- The change in the implementation of `_can_use_numexpr` is likely causing the AttributeError.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error is located in the `_can_use_numexpr` function, particularly in the following line:
```python
s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
```

### Reasons for the Occurrence of the Bug
The changes in the implementation of `_can_use_numexpr` from pandas 0.19.2 to 0.25 have led to the AttributeError. This is due to the fact that the `dtypes` of objects have changed in a way that is not compatible with the previous implementation.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the `_can_use_numexpr` function to handle the changes in `dtypes` of objects accurately, potentially using the `get_dtype_counts()` method.
2. Check the compatibility of dtypes in a more robust way that is compatible with the version differences.
3. Ensure that the `value_counts()` method is called on a Series or DataFrame and not directly on the `dtypes` attribute.

### Corrected Code
Here's the corrected version of the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes") and hasattr(o.dtypes, "value_counts"):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                elif isinstance(o, (pd.Series, pd.DataFrame)) and hasattr(o, "get_dtype_counts"):
                    s = o.get_dtype_counts()
                else:
                    return False
                if len(s) > 1:
                    return False
                dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True
    return False
```

This corrected code introduces a more robust way to handle the compatibility of dtypes and uses the appropriate methods based on the type of the input objects.

By making these changes, the AttributeError should be resolved, and the function should work properly with the current version of pandas.
