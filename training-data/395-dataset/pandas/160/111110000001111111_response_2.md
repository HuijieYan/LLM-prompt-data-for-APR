The bug exists because the method is trying to access the `value_counts()` method on an object of type `numpy.dtype`, which is not a valid operation. This leads to an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to check if the object is a DataFrame or Series and then handle it accordingly.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

_MIN_ELEMENTS = 1000
_ALLOWED_DTYPES = {
    "evaluate": {"float64"}
}

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if isinstance(o, pd.DataFrame):
                    for col in o.columns:
                        s = o[col].dtype
                        dtypes.add(s.name)
                elif isinstance(o, pd.Series):
                    s = o.dtype
                    dtypes.add(s.name)

            # allowed are a superset
            if not dtypes or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check].issuperset(dtypes):
                return True

    return False
```

In this corrected function:
1. The outer iteration loops through `a` and `b` and checks the type of each object.
2. If the object is a DataFrame, it iterates through its columns and collects the data types.
3. If the object is a Series, it directly collects its data type.
4. Finally, it verifies if the allowed data types are a superset of the collected data types before returning the result.

This corrected function should resolve the bug and handle the operations between DataFrame and Series correctly, ensuring that it handles large datasets without issues.
