The issue is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function during expression evaluation where a `numpy.dtype` object is accessed for `value_counts`, leading to an `AttributeError`. This causes the test expressions to fail for various arithmetic operations involving DataFrames and Series when working with large datasets.

The reason for this bug is attributed to recent changes deprecating `get_dtype_counts()` for `numpy.dtype` objects.

To address this, the `_can_use_numexpr` function will need to be updated to check for the availability of the `value_counts` method for the given object and handle `numpy.dtype` objects differently.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    if hasattr(o.dtypes, "value_counts"):
                        s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    else:
                        s = o.dtypes.get_dtype_counts()

                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not dtypes or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

The corrected function now uses the `value_counts` method if available for dtype objects, and also handles `numpy.dtype` objects differently when checking for dtype compatibility.

Given the complexity of this code, thorough testing is recommended to ensure the correct behavior of the updated function.
