The error is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function in the expressions.py file. The AttributeError is due to the line `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()` which is trying to use the `value_counts()` method on the numpy dtype object, but the numpy dtype object does not have a `value_counts()` method.

The reason for this bug is that the `dtypes` attribute is now returning a numpy dtype object instead of a Series. In earlier versions of pandas, the `get_dtype_counts()` method was used, which returned a Series with the counts of each data type in the object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_can_use_numexpr` function to check for the type of the `dtypes` attribute and handle the numpy dtype object differently than the Series object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    if isinstance(o.dtypes, pd.Series):
                        s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                        if len(s) > 1:
                            return False
                        dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                    elif isinstance(o.dtypes, np.dtype):
                        dtypes |= {o.dtypes.name}
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In the corrected code, we check the type of the `dtypes` attribute using `isinstance` and handle the numpy dtype object and the Series object separately. If it's a Series, we proceed with the previous logic. If it's a numpy dtype object, we extract the dtype name and add it to the set of dtypes. This should fix the bug and allow the `add` function to work properly with large DataFrames and Series.
