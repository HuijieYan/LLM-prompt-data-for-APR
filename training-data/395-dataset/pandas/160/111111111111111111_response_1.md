The issue is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function, particularly at the line `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()`. The error is due to a change in behavior in more recent versions of pandas, as the `o.dtypes` is a NumPy dtype object which no longer has the `value_counts()` method.

This change was introduced in the pandas version 0.25 and later. The historical approach of using `get_dtype_counts()` has been deprecated. The function `_can_use_numexpr` is used to determine if numexpr can be used based on certain data check and conditions. The AttributeError indicates that `o.dtypes` is a numpy dtype object and doesn't have the `value_counts()` method.

To fix this issue, the `_can_use_numexpr` method needs to be updated to handle the change in behavior. The alternative is to use `get_dtype_counts()`, which is available in the recent versions of pandas. You can modify the `_can_use_numexpr` function to use `get_dtype_counts()` method as follows:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    if op_str is not None:
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, 'get_dtype_counts'):
                    s = o.get_dtype_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

The verified and updated `_can_use_numexpr` function should address the issue and ensure that the logic for determining whether to use NumExpr works correctly in both older and newer versions of pandas.
