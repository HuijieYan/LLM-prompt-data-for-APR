The bug is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function, particularly in the following line:
```python
s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
```
The AttributeError is raised because the `value_counts()` method is not available for the `numpy.dtype` object.

The potential reason behind this bug is that the function is expecting `o` to be a Pandas Series or DataFrame, but in some test cases, it's a NumPy ndarray. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to call `value_counts()` on the `dtypes` attribute of `o`.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to handle the case where `o` is a NumPy ndarray. We can modify the function to check the type of `o` and handle NumPy ndarrays differently.

Here is the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif hasattr(o, "dtype"):  # handle NumPy ndarrays
                    dtypes.add(str(o.dtype))
                    
            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In this correction, we handle the case where `o` is a NumPy ndarray by checking its type and adding its dtype to the `dtypes` set. The rest of the function remains the same.
