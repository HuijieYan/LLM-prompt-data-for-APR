The bug in the function is caused by using `o.dtypes.value_counts()` to check for dtype compatibility. In this particular case, it's failing because `o.dtypes` is returning a single numpy dtype, which does not have a `value_counts()` method.

To resolve this issue, the function `_can_use_numexpr` should be modified to use an alternative method for checking dtype compatibility. It can use the `np.zeros` function to create a new array and then check the dtype. This would ensure that the dtype compatibility check works regardless of the size of the DataFrame and Series.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtype_a = np.zeros(1, dtype=a.dtype).dtype
            dtype_b = np.zeros(1, dtype=b.dtype).dtype
            if dtype_a == dtype_b:
                return True

    return False
```

This modification will ensure that dtype compatibility is checked correctly and the function will return the expected boolean value based on whether the dtype of the DataFrame and Series are compatible.
