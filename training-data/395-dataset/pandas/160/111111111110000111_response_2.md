The issue arises from the `_can_use_numexpr` function, specifically at this line: `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()` which is now deprecated in newer versions of pandas. The function is trying to check for dtype compatibility between the `DataFrame` and `Series` object, but the method `value_counts()` is not directly available for numpy dtypes.

To fix this issue, we can replace the line `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()` with an alternative method for checking the dtype compatibility. One potential replacement could be `s = o.dtypes.unique()`, which returns unique data types in the input.

Here's the corrected `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    dtypes |= set(o.dtypes)
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # Ensure all dtypes are unique
            if len(dtypes) <= 1:
                return True

    return False
```

With this correction, the function will appropriately check for dtype compatibility between the objects.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to address this issue on the pandas GitHub repository and submit a pull request with the proposed fix to help improve the pandas library for everyone.
