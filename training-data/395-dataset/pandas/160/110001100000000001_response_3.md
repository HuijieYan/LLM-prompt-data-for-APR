Potential error location: The potential error in the code is the comparison `if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes`. It seems like the intention is to check if the set of dtypes is empty or if the dtypes present are allowed based on the _ALLOWED_DTYPES dictionary.

Reason behind the bug: The comparison `if not len(dtypes)` will return True if the set `dtypes` is empty, which is likely not the intended behavior. Additionally, the comparison `_ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes` is not valid because comparing a dictionary with a set is not meaningful.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Change the comparison `if not len(dtypes)` to `if len(dtypes)` to check if the set `dtypes` is not empty.
2. Use the `issubset` method to check if `dtypes` is a subset of the allowed dtypes based on the _ALLOWED_DTYPES dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if len(dtypes) and _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check].issuperset(dtypes):
                return True

    return False
```
