Potential Error Location:
The bug is occurring in the section where the function checks for dtype compatibility. Specifically, the problem lies in the comparison of allowed dtypes and the check for dtype compatibility.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect comparison and logic in the section where the function checks for dtype compatibility. There is inconsistency in the comparison of dtypes, as well as the logic for checking compatibility.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison and logic for dtype compatibility are correctly implemented.
2. Check the comparison of allowed dtypes and the logic for checking compatibility to ensure they are consistent and accurate.
3. Use appropriate methods to compare and check compatibility between dtypes.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

_MIN_ELEMENTS = 1000  # Example value, should be replaced with the appropriate minimum elements required
_ALLOWED_DTYPES = {
    'evaluate': {'float64'}  # Example value, should be replaced with the allowed dtypes for 'evaluate'
}

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = {a.dtype.name, b.dtype.name} if isinstance(a, np.ndarray) and isinstance(b, np.ndarray) else {a.dtype, b.dtype}

            # allowed are a superset
            if _ALLOWED_DTYPES.get(dtype_check, set()).issuperset(dtypes):
                return True

    return False
