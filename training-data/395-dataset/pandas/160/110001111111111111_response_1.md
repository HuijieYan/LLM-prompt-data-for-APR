The bug occurs in the `_can_use_numexpr` function, specifically at the line `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()`. The error is due to the fact that the `numpy.dtype` object has no attribute `value_counts`. The error occurs when performing operations between a DataFrame and a Series on large dataframes, as the script tries to use the `numexpr` library for evaluation.

To fix this bug, the `_can_use_numexpr` function should be updated to handle the dtype compatibility check differently, avoiding the use of `value_counts` on `numpy.dtype` objects. This can be achieved by checking for dtype compatibility with a simpler approach instead of calling `value_counts`. In addition, the use of `numexpr` should be limited or toggled based on the size of the input data to prevent unnecessary overhead for small datasets.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    if len(set(o.dtypes)) > 1:  # Check for dtype compatibility
                        return False
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}
            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True
    return False
```

In this corrected code, the dtype compatibility check has been updated to handle both DataFrame and Series, as well as NumPy ndarray objects. Additionally, the syntax for checking the dtype compatibility has been enhanced to ensure that only compatible dtypes are used in the operations.

By using this updated code, it should be possible to fix the bug in the `expressions.py` file.
