Potential error location: 
The potential error location is within the loop that checks for dtype compatibility. The function is checking if the length of the set of dtypes is zero or if _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] is greater than or equal to dtypes, which is incorrect.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison between _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] and dtypes is not being correctly implemented. The condition for dtype compatibility is incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to compare whether _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] is a superset of dtypes instead of using greater than or equal to comparison. We also need to fix the condition for dtype length, as it should return True when the length of dtypes is greater than 0.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

_MIN_ELEMENTS = 100  # Example value, replace with appropriate minimum elements
_ALLOWED_DTYPES = {dtype: set() for dtype in ["int", "float"]}  # Example value, replace with allowed dtypes

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtype"):
                    s = {str(o.dtype)}
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= s

            # allowed are a superset
            if len(dtypes) > 0 and _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check].issuperset(dtypes):
                return True

    return False
