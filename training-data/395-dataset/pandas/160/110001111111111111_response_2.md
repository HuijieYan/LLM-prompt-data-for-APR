The error is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function inside `pandas/core/computation/expressions.py`. The reason for the bug is that the method `value_counts` is being called on a NumPy `dtype` object, which does not have an attribute called `value_counts`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code in the `_can_use_numexpr` function to handle the case where a `dtype` object does not have the `value_counts` attribute. We also need to check for dtype compatibility differently based on the version of pandas used, keeping in mind the changes in the deprecation of the `get_dtype_counts` method.

Below is the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    if hasattr(o.dtypes, "value_counts"):
                        s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    else:  # handle older pandas versions
                        s = o.dtypes.get_dtype_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes):
                return False
            if dtype_check in _ALLOWED_DTYPES and _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True
    return False
```

This corrected function includes a conditional check to handle older versions of pandas, where the `get_dtype_counts` method is used instead of `value_counts`.

After making these changes, the issue with the `_can_use_numexpr` function should be resolved and it should work correctly with both older and newer versions of pandas.
