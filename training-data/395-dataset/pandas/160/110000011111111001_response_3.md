The function `_can_use_numexpr` is intended to check if the `numexpr` library should be used for the given operation and input parameters. However, it contains a few issues causing the AttributeError.

The possible reason behind the AttributeError is that the function is trying to access the attribute `dtypes` on a numpy dtype object, which doesn't have a `value_counts` attribute.

To fix this, we can modify the function to handle different data types appropriately and address the issues causing the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
import numpy as np

_MIN_ELEMENTS = 1000  # Assuming a minimum number of elements required

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            all_dtypes = set()

            for obj in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(obj, "dtypes"):
                    for col_dtype in obj.dtypes.values:
                        all_dtypes.add(str(col_dtype))
                elif isinstance(obj, np.ndarray):
                    all_dtypes.add(str(obj.dtype))

            # convert set of dtypes to a list
            all_dtypes_list = list(all_dtypes)

            # allowed dtypes for the given dtype_check, assuming _ALLOWED_DTYPES is a pre-defined object
            allowed_dtypes = _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check]

            if all(dt in allowed_dtypes for dt in all_dtypes_list):
                return True

    return False
```

In this corrected function:
1. We iterate over all elements to collect their data types.
2. We then check if all the collected data types are allowed based on the `dtype_check`.
3. If all the data types are allowed, we return `True` to indicate that `numexpr` can be used; otherwise, we return `False`.

This implementation is more robust and handles the data types appropriately, avoiding the AttributeError.
