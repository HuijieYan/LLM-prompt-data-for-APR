The issue seems to arise from the `_can_use_numexpr` function, which is used to determine if numexpr can be used for evaluating the given operation. The error is an AttributeError due to trying to access the `value_counts` attribute on a numpy `dtype` object.

The potential reason for the bug is that the function is trying to access the `value_counts` attribute on a numpy `dtype` object, which does not exist, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_can_use_numexpr` function to handle numpy `dtype` objects differently when checking for the presence of the `value_counts` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
import numpy as np

_MIN_ELEMENTS = 1000  # Replace with the actual minimum required elements

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtype") and hasattr(o.dtype, "kind") and o.dtype.kind not in ["O", "U"]:
                    dtypes.add(str(o.dtype))
                elif hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes.add(str(o.dtype))
            
            # allowed are a superset
            if not dtypes or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True
    return False
```

In this corrected code, we handle numpy `dtype` objects separately to avoid trying to access the `value_counts` attribute on them. We also added a check for the `dtype` attribute and kind to make sure it's not of type "object" or "unicode".

By making these modifications, we should be able to fix the bug and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
