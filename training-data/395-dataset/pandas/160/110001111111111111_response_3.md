The issue here lies in the `_can_use_numexpr` function, which checks whether the dataset it operates on is large enough to warrant the use of the numexpr library, which is optimized for large datasets. The bug is raised at the line `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()` because `o` is a numpy dtype object, which does not have a `value_counts` method. The use of `get_dtype_counts` has been deprecated, which was the method that used to work in previous versions. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_can_use_numexpr` function to use the existing `dtypes` attribute of the DataFrame or Series and then check if it contains more than one unique dtype. If it does, we can return `False` to indicate that numexpr should not be used. Otherwise, we can return `True`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """Return a boolean indicating if numexpr will be used."""
    if op_str is not None:

        # Required minimum elements (otherwise adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # Check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = [a.dtype]
            if not pd.Series([a.dtype, b.dtype]).nunique() > 1:
                return True

    return False
```

By using the dtype of the Series and checking if there is more than one unique dtype between the Series and DataFrame, we can determine whether to use numexpr or not. This updated code should resolve the bug and prevent it from occurring in similar scenarios.
