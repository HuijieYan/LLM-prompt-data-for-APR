The error occurs in the function `_can_use_numexpr` which is supposed to check if the NumPy and pandas data types are compatible and if the number of elements is sufficient to justify using numexpr. The error specifically indicates that the attribute 'value_counts' is being called on the `dtypes` attribute of a numpy.dtype object, which does not exist. This is likely due to a mismatch between the expected object and the actual object being operated on.

To fix this, we can modify the loop that iterates through the variables `a` and `b` to ensure that the correct operations are applied based on the type of object being handled. This will prevent attribute errors and ensure that the function operates as intended.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if isinstance(o, pd.DataFrame) or isinstance(o, pd.Series):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In this corrected function, we have added type-checking conditions to handle different types of input objects and retrieve the dtype information accordingly without causing attribute errors. This will make the function more robust and prevent the specific attribute errors that were encountered during the test.
