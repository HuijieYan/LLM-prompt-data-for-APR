The error seems to be occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function, specifically at the line where it's trying to handle the data types. The error message indicates that 'numpy.dtype' object has no attribute 'value_counts', which is consistent with the code trying to call 'value_counts()' on 'dtypes' which is a 'numpy.dtype' object.

The cause of this bug could be a regression issue between pandas 0.19.2 and 0.25, where the `get_dtype_counts()` method was replaced with `value_counts()` and eventually the `dtype` object was no longer a pandas Series or DataFrame and hence did not have the `value_counts` method.

To fix this bug, the `_can_use_numexpr` function needs to be modified to handle numpy data types appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    # Check if it's a pandas object
                    if hasattr(o.dtypes, "value_counts"):
                        s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                        if len(s) > 1:
                            return False
                        dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                    else:
                        # If not, it's a numpy array
                        dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In this corrected version, the code checks if `o.dtypes` has the attribute `value_counts`. If it does, it proceeds as before. If not, it assumes that `o` is a numpy array and uses `o.dtype.name` to get the type of the numpy array.
