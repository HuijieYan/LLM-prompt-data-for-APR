The error is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function at the following line:
```python
s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
```
This is causing an AttributeError because in pandas 0.25, `dtypes` returns a numpy.dtype object which does not have a `value_counts` method.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is using a method that is no longer available in the pandas version in which it is running. In pandas 0.25, `dtypes` returns a numpy.dtype object instead of a Series with dtype information, hence the call to `value_counts` results in an AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be updated to use the `get_dtype_counts()` method instead of `dtypes.value_counts()`. This method is available for both pandas 0.19.2 and 0.25.

Here's the corrected `_can_use_numexpr` function:
```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, 'get_dtype_counts'):
                    s = o.get_dtype_counts()
```
This change will ensure that the code runs successfully on both pandas 0.19.2 and 0.25.
