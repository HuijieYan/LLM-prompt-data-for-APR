The bug appears to be in the `_can_use_numexpr` function. The function has a condition that checks for dtype compatibility, using `_ALLOWED_DTYPES`. However, the comparison is not correctly implemented in a way that checks if the allowed dtypes are a superset of the dtypes present in the input data.

Based on the input and expected cases, it seems that the function should be checking if all the dtypes in the input data are present in the allowed dtypes.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. We need to ensure that all dtypes present in the input data are allowed.
2. We should iterate over all the elements in `a` and `b` to gather all the dtypes, and then compare them with the allowed dtypes.
3. If any dtype in the input is not allowed, we should return False.

Here's a corrected version of the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):  # Added to account for numpy arrays
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}
            # Check if all dtypes in the input are allowed
            if dtypes.issubset(_ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check]):
                return True
    return False
```
