The error message indicates that the `isocalendar` function is not returning the expected DataFrame. The specific values for 'year', 'week', and 'day' are not as expected. The issue seems to be within the computation of the ISO calendar values in the `isocalendar` function.

The probable error location within the `isocalendar` function is that the calculation of ISO calendar values is not matching the expected output due to the timezone difference.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the computation of ISO calendar values does not account for the changes in the week numbers that can occur due to the timezone differences.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use a different method to calculate the ISO calendar values that explicitly take the timezone into account. This can involve adjusting the date to UTC before extracting ISO calendar values.

The corrected code for the `isocalendar` function is as follows:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
