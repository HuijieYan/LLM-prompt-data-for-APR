The problematic function `isocalendar` is intended to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. The function currently uses a variable `fields`, which is not defined in the provided code. This variable is used to call the function `build_isocalendar_sarray`, which is not defined as well, leading to the function not working as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the reference to `fields` and `build_isocalendar_sarray` and replace them with a built-in method or function that can achieve the same behavior.

Given the input and expected output, and the description of the problem, the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function is as follows:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    # Extract year, week, and day from the DatetimeArray using built-in methods
    year = self.strftime('%Y').astype('UInt32')
    week = self.week
    day = self.dayofweek + 1  # Adjust day to start from 1

    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame({
        "year": year,
        "week": week,
        "day": day
    })
    
    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, we use built-in methods of `DatetimeArray` to extract the year, week, and day values. This ensures that the function does not depend on any undefined or external modules or functions.
