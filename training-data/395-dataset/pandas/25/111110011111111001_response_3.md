The `isocalendar` function is supposed to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. The expected test case checks if the function returns the expected DataFrame close to the new year with the specified timezone.

The error message indicates that the `assert_frame_equal` function in the test case failed because the `ExtensionArray` values are different. Specifically, the `left` and `right` values for the year in the DataFrame are different.

The potential error in the `isocalendar` function might be related to the calculation of the ISO calendar values (year, week, day) for the given datetime values. The incorrect calculation or assignment of these values could lead to differences in the test result compared to the expected values.

The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect retrieval or manipulation of the datetime values in the `isocalendar` function, leading to incorrect ISO calendar values.

To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure that the ISO calendar values (year, week, day) are correctly calculated and assigned to the DataFrame. Additionally, any handling of timezone-related calculations should be done accurately to prevent discrepancies in the results.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

After fixing the potential issues related to datetime value handling and calculation, running the test case should now produce the expected result, and the `assert_frame_equal` function should no longer fail.
