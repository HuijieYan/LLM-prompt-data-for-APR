The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect calculation of the day of the week. This is evident from the fact that the test values provided do not align with the expected output.

The reason for the bug might be the incorrect calculation of the day of the week from the input datetime array, specifically in the `sarray` generated from the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method. The day of the week should be computed using the correct values provided by the `DatetimeArray`.

To fix the bug, the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method should be reviewed, and the calculation for the day of the week adjusted to accurately represent the input datetime array. Additionally, the assignment of `iso_calendar_df.iloc` might need to be corrected to ensure it reflects the correct values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```
With the above correction, the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method should provide the correct representation of the day of the week based on the input datetime array.
