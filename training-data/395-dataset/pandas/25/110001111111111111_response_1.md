This buggy function aims to extract the year, week, and day from a DatetimeIndex according to the ISO 8601 standard.

The input parameters of the function were self.tz, self, self._local_timestamps, self.asi8, self._hasnans, and self._isnan.

Looking at the expected results, sarray was expected to have values [(2013, 52, 6), (2013, 52, 7), (2014,  1, 1)] and iso_calendar_df was expected to be a DataFrame as shown. However, the assertion failed, indicating that the values were different from the expected ones.

To fix the code, it's necessary to revisit the logic for generating the sarray and the iso_calendar_df. It seems that there might be an issue with the week and day calculation. It's important to ensure that the calculations are correctly performed, especially in the proximity of the new year where week numbers may change.

In the bug case, the "week" in the result is off by one, which indicates a potential calculation error when dealing with the ISO 8601 week. The weekdays also seem to be wrongly calculated.

It's important to verify the algorithms used to compute ISO 8601 week and day in the problematic function and make necessary corrections.

Here's the corrected code for the function after fixing the buggy parts:

```python

    """
