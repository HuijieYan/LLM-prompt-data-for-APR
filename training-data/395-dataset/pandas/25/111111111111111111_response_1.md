The given function is expected to return a DataFrame with year, week, and day values calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. However, the function seems to have a bug as the expected and actual results are different.

The bug is with how the week value is calculated inside the `isocalendar` function. The week value is off by one (e.g., 7 should be 6) due to incorrect week calculation logic.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to adjust the week calculation logic to correctly align with ISO 8601 standard, especially when it comes to weeks that cross year boundaries. This can be achieved by manipulating the datetime values and using appropriate functions to calculate the ISO week.

Here's the corrected version of the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week, and day

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame
    from datetime import date
    
    def iso_year_start(iso_year):
        # returns the first day of the ISO year as per ISO 8601 standard
        fourth_jan = date(iso_year, 1, 4)
        delta = timedelta(days=fourth_jan.isoweekday() - 1)
        return fourth_jan - delta
    
    year, week, _ = np.vectorize(lambda x: x.isocalendar())(self.to_pydatetime())
    mask = (week == 53) & (self.to_pydatetime().day > 28)
    week = np.where(mask, 1, week)  # ISO 8601: Week 53 should days > 28 are 1
    
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        {"year": year, "week": week, "day": self.to_pydatetime().day}, dtype="UInt32"
    )
    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, we are using `numpy` to perform the vectorized operation on the datetimes to calculate the ISO calendar values. Additionally, we are taking care of special cases like Week 53, ensuring that it aligns with the ISO 8601 standard. After making these adjustments, the function should return the expected results.
