Potential error location: 

The error is likely occurring due to the usage of the `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` function, which is not defined within the provided code. The `sarray` variable is used to build the `iso_calendar_df`, where the `build_isocalendar_sarray` function is expected to return an array with year, week, and day information.


Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug is likely occurring because the `build_isocalendar_sarray` function is not defined within the provided code, and no information is given about where it is defined or how it should work. This means the `isocalendar` method is currently incomplete and cannot function properly without the `build_isocalendar_sarray` function.


Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. The `build_isocalendar_sarray` function needs to be defined or imported from a relevant module in order to complete the implementation of the `isocalendar` method.
2. Once the `build_isocalendar_sarray` function is included, it should return an array with year, week, and day information based on the ISO 8601 standard.


Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day
