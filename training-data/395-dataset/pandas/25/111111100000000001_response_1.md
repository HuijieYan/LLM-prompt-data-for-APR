The potential error in the provided code is the use of the `fields` module without explicitly importing it, which means it is a missing import.

The reason the bug occurs is because the `fields` module is being used without being imported. This will result in a NameError when the function is called because `fields` is not defined.

To fix the bug, the `fields` module needs to be imported at the top of the file. Assuming that `fields` is a module within the pandas library, the corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function with import statement added
from pandas.core import fields

def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
