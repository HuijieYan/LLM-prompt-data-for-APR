The test case attempts to create a `DatetimeIndex` and then calls the `isocalendar` function on it. The expected output is a DataFrame with columns "year", "week", and "day" based on the ISO 8601 standard.

The `isocalendar` function is expected to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. However, the error message indicates that the returned ExtensionArray values are different from the expected values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the construction of the `sarray` and the subsequent DataFrame. 

The bug occurs because the `sarray` is not being constructed properly. 

To fix this bug, the `sarray` should be constructed from the underlying datetime array using the appropriate function.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day
