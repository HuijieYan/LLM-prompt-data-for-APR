The test case `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz` is designed to check the correctness of the `isocalendar` function. This test case creates a DatetimeIndex with dates close to the new year and a timezone 'Europe/Brussels', then calls the `isocalendar` function on this DatetimeIndex. It compares the result with an expected DataFrame containing year, week, and day information.

The error message indicates a values difference between the expected result and the actual result. The extension array values are different, and this is causing the AssertionError.

The potential error location within the buggy function is identified in the line where the DataFrame `iso_calendar_df` is created. The bug seems to be related to how the `isocalendar` method calculates the year and week values.

The bug seems to occur because the `isocalendar` function is incorrectly computing the year and week values. It appears that the logic within the `isocalendar` function is not correctly handling the transition from one year to the next, leading to incorrect week and year values.

To fix the bug, the logic to compute the year and week values needs to be updated to handle the transition from one year to the next correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
