The error message indicates that the values in the 'year' column of the DataFrame returned by the 'isocalendar' method are different from the expected values. Specifically, the third value in the 'year' column is different from the expected value.

The potential error in the problematic function is likely in the calculation of the year value.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the transition of dates between different years. When a date is close to the new year, the year value might not be calculated accurately.

To fix this bug, we can modify the 'isocalendar' method to handle the transition of dates between different years more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the 'isocalendar' method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None

    # Handle transition of dates between different years
    iso_calendar_df['year'] = (self + pd.to_timedelta('1d')).year
    iso_calendar_df['year'] = np.where((self.month == 1) & (self.week > 50), self.year - 1, iso_calendar_df['year'])

    return iso_calendar_df
```

By including a specific handling for the transition of dates between different years, the corrected method should produce the expected 'year' values in the DataFrame returned by the 'isocalendar' method.
