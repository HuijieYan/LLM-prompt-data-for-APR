Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is the use of `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` which is not defined within the function and might be causing the bug. This is likely leading to a NameError when the function is called.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the function is using a method `build_isocalendar_sarray` from a module or source that is not imported or defined within the function. This is causing a NameError when the function is called.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the necessary module or source that contains the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method into the function.
2. Ensure that the method `build_isocalendar_sarray` is defined and accessible within the function.
