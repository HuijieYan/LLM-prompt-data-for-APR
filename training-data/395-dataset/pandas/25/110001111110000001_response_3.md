Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `isocalendar` method of the `DatetimeIndex` class. The function is not correctly handling the date calculations close to the new year, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug could be occurring due to inaccuracies in the date calculations performed by the `isocalendar` method, resulting in incorrect week, year, or day values. This could be related to the handling of leap years or the calculation of weeknumbers close to the new year.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for calculating the ISO 8601 standard year, week, and day values to ensure accuracy, especially near the transition from one year to the next.
2. Verify that the timezone information is being handled correctly, as the test case involves dates with a specific timezone.
3. Consider edge cases such as leap years and the transition from December to January when calculating week numbers and day values.

Corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
import numpy as np

def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
