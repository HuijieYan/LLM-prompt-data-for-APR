Based on the test case provided, the `isocalendar` method aims to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. The input parameters include `self` (an instance of an object), `self.asi8` (an array of integers), `self._hasnans` (a boolean), and `self._isnan` (an array of booleans). All of these inputs seem to be correct based on the provided example.

The function seems to be generating an array called `sarray` using `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)` and then creating a DataFrame called `iso_calendar_df` using this `sarray`. The next step involves setting the values in `iso_calendar_df` rows with the indices from `self._isnan` to `None`, which is done to handle cases where NaN values are present.

The potential bug in the code occurs when setting values in `iso_calendar_df` rows to `None`. The `iloc` method should be used for this purpose. However, since `iloc` is a method, it seems like that the mutable object (in this case, the `iso_calendar_df`) is not updated with the `None` values.

To fix this issue, it's important to ensure that the `iloc` method is correctly called to update the values in the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected function incorporating the fix:
