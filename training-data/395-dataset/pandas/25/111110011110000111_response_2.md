Potential error location:
The potential error may be in the `isocalendar` function, where the `sarray` is being computed and then converted to a DataFrame. The issue might be related to the incorrect calculation of the ISO 8601 standard week for the provided dates.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may be occurring because the ISO 8601 standard for week calculation is not being correctly applied to the provided dates. This results in incorrect week values being assigned to the dates, leading to differences between the expected and actual results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Verify that the ISO 8601 standard week calculation is being correctly applied to the provided dates.
2. Ensure that the conversion of the calculated `sarray` to a DataFrame is performed correctly, taking into account any potential NaN values.
3. Check for any inconsistencies between the expected and actual results that might be related to the week calculation and its representation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
