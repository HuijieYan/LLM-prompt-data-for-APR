The error message indicates that the `isocalendar` function is not returning the expected values. The bug is likely in the implementation of the `isocalendar` function. 

Based on the error message, the bug seems to be related to the week numbers in the `isocalendar` function. The week numbers are not being calculated correctly, leading to the failed assertion in the test function.

The bug might be caused by an error in the logic for calculating week numbers in the `isocalendar` function. To fix this, the week numbers need to be calculated correctly according to the ISO 8601 standard.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

With the corrected code, the `isocalendar` function should now return the correct values and pass the test case.
