Potential Error Location:
The error could be occurring within the function when creating the DataFrame 'iso_calendar_df' and setting the elements to None if 'self._hasnans' is True.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
It is possible that the function is setting the elements to None in 'iso_calendar_df' when 'self._hasnans' is False. Additionally, 'self._local_timestamps' is not being used in the function, which should likely be used in the computation of 'iso_calendar_df'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use 'self._local_timestamps' in the computation of 'iso_calendar_df'.
2. Check if 'self._hasnans' is True before setting elements to None.

Corrected code:

```python
