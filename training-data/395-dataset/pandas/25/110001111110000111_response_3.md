The error message indicates that the `isocalendar` method is not returning the expected DataFrame. It seems that the issue is related to the `isocalendar` method itself, as the error message mentions that the `ExtensionArray` values are different.

The potential error location within the `isocalendar` method is the calculation of the ISO calendar values.

The bug likely occurs because the logic for calculating ISO calendar week, year, and day is faulty, resulting in the incorrect values being assigned to the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the ISO calendar values need to be recalculated correctly to ensure that the resulting DataFrame matches the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also

    Examples

    >>> idx.isocalendar()

    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    # Recalculate ISO calendar values correctly
    year, week, day = self.to_pydatetime().isocalendar()

    # Create a DataFrame with the calculated ISO calendar values
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        {"year": year, "week": week, "day": day}, index=self, dtype="UInt32"
