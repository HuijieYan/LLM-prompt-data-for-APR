Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the function `isocalendar` where the `sarray` is being created from the `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` method. This array is then used to create the `iso_calendar_df` DataFrame.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely caused by the incorrect values being passed to the `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` method or during the creation of the DataFrame. As per the provided input and expected values in the test case, the week number is not matching for the specific date range.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The method `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` should be debugged to verify that it correctly calculates the ISO calendar standard values.
2. After obtaining the `sarray`, the creation of the `iso_calendar_df` DataFrame should be reviewed to ensure that the correct values from the `sarray` are being used to populate the DataFrame columns.
3. The handling of NaN values using `_hasnans` and `_isnan` should also be reviewed to ensure it works correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
