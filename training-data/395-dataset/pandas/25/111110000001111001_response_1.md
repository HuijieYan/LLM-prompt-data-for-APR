The `DatetimeArray.isocalendar` function extracts year, week, and day of the week from the datetime data according to the ISO 8601 standard. It seems that the bug is related to the week calculation within the `isocalendar` method.

We need to modify the calculation of the week in the `isocalendar` method to return the correct values according to the ISO 8601 standard. 

Here's the corrected function for the `isocalendar` method:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import DataFrame

def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas.tseries.offsets import YearBegin
    week = ((self - YearBegin()) + np.timedelta64(3, 'D')).astype('timedelta64[W]')
    year = week.index.year
    week = week.dt.week
    day = week.index.to_series().dt.dayofweek + 1
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame({'year': year, 'week': week, 'day': day}, dtype="UInt32")
    return iso_calendar_df
```
In this corrected code, we are using the `pandas.tseries.offsets.YearBegin` to calculate the week according to the ISO 8601 standard. We extract the year, week, and day of the week and return them as a DataFrame.
