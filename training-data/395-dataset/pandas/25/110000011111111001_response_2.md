The test case `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz` checks whether the `isocalendar` method for a `DatetimeIndex` returns the correct DataFrame. The error message indicates that there is a difference in ExtensionArray values.

The potential error location lies within the `isocalendar` function where the ISO 8601 standard week calculation is performed.

The bug occurs because the ISO week calculation is not handling the transition between the end of one year and the beginning of the next year correctly. This is evident in the difference of values obtained from the ExtensionArray between the expected result and the actual function result.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the transition between the years when calculating the ISO week. The week number should be incremented when the date belongs to the beginning of the next year. Additionally, the day number should also be adjusted accordingly when transitioning between years.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
