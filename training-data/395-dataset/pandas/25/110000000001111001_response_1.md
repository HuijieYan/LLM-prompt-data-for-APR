The buggy function `isocalendar` is supposed to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. It is using an array `self.asi8` to build an `sarray` which is later converted to a DataFrame called `iso_calendar_df`. However, the returned DataFrame is incorrect due to an incorrect year and week calculation.

The problem lies in the calculation of `sarray`. The year, week, and day should be calculated based on the ISO 8601 standard, but the current implementation does not adhere to this standard.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the calculation of `year`, `week`, and `day` is done according to the ISO 8601 standard.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame, Series

    sarray = fields.build_iso8601_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32")
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.loc[self._isnan, :] = None

    return iso_calendar_df
```

In this corrected code, the calculation of `sarray` is done using the `build_iso8601_sarray` method to ensure that the year, week, and day are calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. Additionally, the `iloc` method is replaced with `loc` to correctly assign `None` values to the `iso_calendar_df` DataFrame.
