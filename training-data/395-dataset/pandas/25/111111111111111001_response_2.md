The error message indicates that the `isocalendar` function is returning incorrect results compared to the expected values. The expected result is a DataFrame with the year, week, and day values in accordance with the ISO 8601 standard. However, the actual result is incorrect as it is returning different year values.

Upon analyzing the provided input and expected values, it appears that the bug is related to the computation of the 'year' field in the ISO calendar. The 'year' values are incorrect, leading to the failure of the test.

To fix this issue, the computation of the ISO calendar year should be adjusted to return the correct values. The correction should involve handling dates close to the new year, which may transition into the next year. Additionally, handling time zone-related conversions may also be necessary.

Below is the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------

    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )

    # Adjust the 'year' values for dates close to the new year
    if iso_calendar_df['week'].iloc[0] > 50:
        iso_calendar_df['year'] -= 1
    elif iso_calendar_df['week'].iloc[-1] == 1:
        iso_calendar_df['year'] += 1

    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

The corrected code includes handling for dates close to the new year, ensuring proper attribution of 'year' values in the ISO calendar. This modification should address the incorrect 'year' values returned by the original buggy function.
