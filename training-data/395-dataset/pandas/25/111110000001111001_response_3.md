The problem seems to be with the calculation of the ISO calendar days, which is one day later than expected. This might be due to the incorrect conversion from the input datetimes to an internal representation.

The issue could be related to the internal representation of datetimes in the `DatetimeArray` class, specifically when converting tz-naive datetimes to tz-aware datetimes.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `DatetimeArray` class handles tz conversion correctly, and the internal representation of the datetimes should align with the expected behavior of `isocalendar` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:
```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8, self.tz)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```
In the corrected code, the `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` function is used to calculate the ISO calendar days, taking into account the timezone information. This function should already handle the internal representation of datetimes correctly.
