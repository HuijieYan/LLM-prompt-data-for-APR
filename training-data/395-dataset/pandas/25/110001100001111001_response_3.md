The function `isocalendar` seems to be throwing no error but the definition in the comments does not match with the actual function implementation. Looking at the runtime and expected values, the issue seems to be with the conversion to ISO calendar.

Given the expected value of the `sarray` and the actual value of `sarray` confirms that there is an issue in the computation. It seems that the week computation is off by one.

To fix the bug, you need to check the logic of the week computation and fix it. If the week starts from 1, you need to accurately calculate that into the `sarray`.
