The error is likely to occur in the `build_isocalendar_sarray` function which generates the `sarray` from `self.asi8` array. The values in the `sarray` seem to be off by one day from the expected values.

This could be due to a mismatch in the starting day of the week between ISO 8601 (which starts with Monday) and the Pandas default (which starts with Sunday).

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the output values of the `build_isocalendar_sarray` function to align with the ISO 8601 standard, where Monday is the first day of the week.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame, Series
    
    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    
    # Adjusting the values to align with ISO 8601 standard
    sarray['day'] = np.where(sarray['day'] == 7, 0, sarray['day'])
    
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32")
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, after creating the `sarray`, we apply a conditional replacement to adjust the day values in `sarray` to align with the ISO 8601 standard.
