Potential error location:
The issue appears to be with the calculation of the 'week' and 'day' in the isocalendar function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the 'week' and 'day' are not calculated correctly, leading to incorrect values in the DataFrame.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the calculation of the 'week' and 'day' to ensure they are following the ISO 8601 standard.
2. Verify the input date values and their conversion to ISO calendar format.
3. Ensure that the array indexes are handled correctly to retrieve the ISO calendar values.

Corrected code:
