The purpose of the isocalendar method is to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. This function is called on a DatetimeArray object.

The error seems to be in the way the 'sarray' variable is created, which is then used to create the DataFrame 'iso_calendar_df'. The 'sarray' is created using the build_isocalendar_sarray method, taking the 'self.asi8' as an input argument. However, the resulting 'sarray' seems to be incorrect based on the expected output and the input values.

To fix the bug, the 'sarray' should be created such that it accurately calculates the year, week, and day based on the ISO 8601 standard from the provided input (in this case, 'self.asi8').

The corrected function/method is presented below:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------

    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7

    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    # Correcting the sarray creation based on the input
    sarray = np.empty(len(self.asi8), dtype=[('year', '<u4'), ('week', '<u4'), ('day', '<u4')])
    for i, timestamp in enumerate(self.asi8):
        dt = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp / 1e9)
        year, week, day = dt.isocalendar()
        sarray[i] = (year, week, day)

    # Creating DataFrame from sarray
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

The changes include a modification in how 'sarray' is created. It now uses the datetime module to accurately calculate the ISO year, week, and day values based on the input timestamps before creating a DataFrame 'iso_calendar_df' from it.
