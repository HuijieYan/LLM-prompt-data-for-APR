The error seems to occur in the `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz()` test function, where it checks the output of the `isocalendar()` method against an expected DataFrame. The error message indicates that the values in the expected DataFrame are different from the values produced by the `isocalendar()` method.

Based on the information provided, the potential error location within the `isocalendar()` method is likely in the calculation of the `sarray` variable. The `sarray` variable is created by calling `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)`, where `self.asi8` is an ndarray containing the values of the DatetimeArray.

The issue seems to be related to how the `sarray` values are being calculated from the `self.asi8` array, which results in incorrect year, week, and day values in the `iso_calendar_df`. This discrepancy causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the `sarray` needs to be modified to ensure that the ISO 8601 standard for year, week, and day is correctly applied. Additionally, the expected DataFrame should align with the correct ISO 8601 standard calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar()` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    from pandas import DataFrame

    # Calculate ISO 8601 year, week, and day from the Asi8 values in self
    year, week, day = fields.build_iso8601_week_from_datetimes(self.asi8)

    # Create a DataFrame with the calculated year, week, and day
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        {"year": year, "week": week, "day": day}, dtype="UInt32"
    )
    
    # Handling missing values if self contains NaNs
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.loc[self._isnan] = None
    
    return iso_calendar_df
```

In this corrected code, we assume the existence of a function `fields.build_iso8601_week_from_datetimes()` that correctly calculates the ISO 8601 week from the given datetime values. The function returns three arrays for year, week, and day, which are then used to create the `iso_calendar_df` DataFrame. Finally, missing values are handled according to the presence of NaNs in the input data.
