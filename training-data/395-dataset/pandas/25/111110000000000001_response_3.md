The error in the provided function is that it is trying to access an attribute `self.asi8`, but this attribute is not defined anywhere in the code. This is the potential error location within the function.

The reason behind the bug is that the `asi8` attribute is expected to contain the underlying int64 representation of the datetime data. However, it is not defined or initialized anywhere in the code.

To fix this bug, the `asi8` attribute needs to be properly initialized within the `DatetimeArray` class, either during instantiation or through a separate method specifically for setting the `asi8` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function with the `asi8` attribute properly initialized:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day
