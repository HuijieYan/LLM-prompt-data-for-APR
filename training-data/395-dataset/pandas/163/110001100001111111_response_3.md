The bug is causing the array to be read-only, leading to a ValueError when attempting to assign values to it. This is occurring because the `values` array is being passed in with a read-only flag, preventing any changes from being made to it.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we create a new copy of the array with the writeable flag set to True before making any modifications to it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_prep_values` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_float_dtype, is_integer_dtype, needs_i8_conversion

def _prep_values(self, values: Optional[np.ndarray] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """Convert input to numpy arrays for Cython routines"""
    if values is None:
        values = getattr(self._selected_obj, "values", self._selected_obj)

    # Make a copy of the array with the writeable flag set to True
    values = np.array(values, copy=True, dtype=np.float64)

    # Always convert inf to nan
    values[np.isinf(values)] = np.NaN

    return values
```

By creating a new copy of the array with the writeable flag set to True, we ensure that we can modify the array without encountering a ValueError due to it being read-only.
