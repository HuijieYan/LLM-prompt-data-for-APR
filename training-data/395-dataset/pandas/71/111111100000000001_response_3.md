The potential error in the provided function is in the block of code where it checks if `bins` is iterable. It does not handle the case where `bins` is a scalar and less than 1. This can potentially lead to a ValueError not being properly raised if `bins` is not a positive integer.

The reasons behind this bug are that the function does not properly handle the case when `bins` is a scalar and less than 1. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `bins` is a scalar and less than 1 and then raise a ValueError accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    if is_scalar(bins) and bins < 1:
        raise ValueError("`bins` should be a positive integer.")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
