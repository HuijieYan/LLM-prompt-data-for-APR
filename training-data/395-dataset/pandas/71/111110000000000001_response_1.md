Potential error location: The error may be occurring due to the handling of the `bins` input in the `cut` function. The code that checks the type of `bins` and processes it seems to be leading to potential errors.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug could be caused by incorrect handling of the `bins` input. The function has various conditional blocks to handle different types of `bins`, and an error may arise due to incorrect processing of these conditions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the code correctly handles different types of `bins` input, such as int, sequence of scalars, or IntervalIndex.
2. Check for edge cases and input validation to avoid unexpected behavior.
3. Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.api.types as pd_types
from pandas.api.extensions import (
    ExtensionArray,
    ExtensionDtype,
    register_extension_dtype,
)

def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    """
    Bin values into discrete intervals.

    ... # remaining docstring

    Parameters

    """

    # Preprocess the input for cutting
    if pd_types.is_extension_array_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
        original = x
        x = x.data
    else:
        original = x
        x = pd.Categorical(x)

    if not np.iterable(bins):
        bins, bin_dtype = _parse_cut_bins(x, bins, dtype)

    # Here you would continue with the rest of the logic for binning the input data,
    # handling different types of `bins`, and post-processing the results.

    # Return the result of the binning process
    return result

def _parse_cut_bins(x, bins, dtype):
    if pd_types.is_scalar(bins) and bins < 1:
        raise ValueError("`bins` should be a positive integer.")

    return _convert_bin_to_numeric_type(bins, dtype), _infer_dtype(bins)

def _convert_bin_to_numeric_type(bins, dtype):
    if pd_types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(bins):
        bins = np.asarray(bins, dtype=pd_types._NS_DTYPE)
    else:
        bins = np.asarray(bins)
    bins = pd_types._convert_to_dtype(bins, dtype)
    return bins

# This is just a sketch of the corrected function, and it would need further implementation
```

This corrected function provides a more modular and organized approach to handling the `bins` input and incorporates better error checking and handling. Further implementation details and additional error checking would be required for a fully functional solution.
