The error message states that the input array must be 1-dimensional. This indicates that the problematic function does not handle multi-dimensional input arrays.

The potential error location is at the beginning of the `cut` function, where we preprocess the input array by calling the `_preprocess_for_cut` function and coerce the input to a particular data type using the `_coerce_to_type` function.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle multi-dimensional input arrays. By directly calling the `_preprocess_for_cut` and `_coerce_to_type` functions, we assume that the input is one-dimensional. This causes issues when the input array is multidimensional, resulting in the error message.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to check the dimensionality of the input array and handle multi-dimensional arrays appropriately. We can reshape the array to be one-dimensional before preprocessing and coercion. Additionally, we should ensure that the preprocessing and conversion are applied element-wise for multi-dimensional arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `cut` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    """
    Bin values into discrete intervals.
    (Rest of the function comments and documentation remain unchanged)
    """
    
    # Check whether the input array x is multi-dimensional
    if isinstance(x, np.ndarray):
        if x.ndim > 1:
            # Flatten the input array to 1D
            x = x.flatten()
    
    original = x
    x = _preprocess_for_cut(x)
    x, dtype = _coerce_to_type(x)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the input `x` is a multi-dimensional array, and if it is, we flatten it before preprocessing and coercion. This addresses the issue of handling multi-dimensional input arrays and ensures compatibility with the rest of the function.
