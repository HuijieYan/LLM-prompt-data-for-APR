The buggy function is the pandas cut function, which is used to bin values into discrete intervals. It's supposed to work on 1-dimensional arrays.

Looking at the provided test cases, it seems that the issue lies in how the function handles NaN values within the input array. The current implementation is not handling these NaN values correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior that can lead to failures such as ValueError or incorrect binning.

To fix this, the function should handle NaN values gracefully and ensure that the binning process works as intended even when NaN values are present in the input array.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    x = pd.Series(x)
    bins = np.array(bins)
    
    out, bins = pd.cut(
        x,
        bins=bins,
        right=right,
        labels=labels,
        retbins=retbins,
        precision=precision,
        include_lowest=include_lowest,
        duplicates=duplicates
    )
    
    return out, bins
```

In this corrected code, the input array `x` is converted to a pandas Series to leverage the built-in cut function for binning with better handling of NaN values. The `bins` parameter is converted to a numpy array to ensure compatibility with the pandas cut function. The function then returns the binned output and the bins, similar to the original behavior.
