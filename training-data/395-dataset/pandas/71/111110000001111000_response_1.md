    Bin values into discrete intervals.

    Use `cut` when you need to segment and sort data values into bins. This
    function is also useful for going from a continuous variable to a
    categorical variable. For example, `cut` could convert ages to groups of
    age ranges. Supports binning into an equal number of bins, or a
    pre-specified array of bins.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        The input array to be binned. Must be 1-dimensional.
    bins : int, sequence of scalars, or IntervalIndex
        The criteria to bin by.
        ...

    Returns
    -------
    out : Categorical, Series, or ndarray
        An array-like object representing the respective bin for each value
        of `x`. The type depends on the value of `labels`.
        * True (default) : returns a Series for Series `x` or a
          Categorical for all other inputs. The values stored within
          are Interval dtype.
        ...
    bins : numpy.ndarray or IntervalIndex.
        The computed or specified bins. Only returned when `retbins=True`.
        For scalar or sequence `bins`, this is an ndarray with the computed
        bins. If set `duplicates=drop`, `bins` will drop non-unique bin.
        For an IntervalIndex `bins`, this is equal to `bins`.
