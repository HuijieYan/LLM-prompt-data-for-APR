The `cut` function seems to have a bug related to the handling of inclusive and exclusive bin edges. In some cases, the function sets the parameters `right` and `include_lowest` as `False` instead of `True`. This would result in incorrect binning behavior because it affects whether the bins include the rightmost edge or the lowest interval value.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the `right` and `include_lowest` parameters are correctly set based on their default behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `cut` function:

```python
def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = True,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    # Existing code remains the same, except for the default value of include_lowest

    # ... (existing code)

    return _postprocess_for_cut(fac, bins, retbins, dtype, original)

```

By providing the correct default value for `include_lowest` parameter, we can ensure that the binning behavior aligns with the expected logic and the bug is resolved.
