The error message "TypeError: boolean value of NA is ambiguous" indicates that there is an issue with handling missing (NaN) values in the `pd.cut` function.

The issue seems to be related to the way missing values are handled when applying the `pd.cut` function to an array with missing values. The error occurs when the function tries to search for values in bins and handle missing values as booleans, leading to ambiguity.

To fix this issue, one approach could be to modify the implementation of the `_bins_to_cuts` function to properly handle missing values when performing the binning operation. This may involve explicitly handling the missing values before performing operations that involve boolean comparisons.

Here's the corrected function with potential fixes applied:

```python
# corrected code for the cut function
def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    # handle missing values in x
    x = pd.array(x, dtype="Int64")

    fac, bins = _bins_to_cuts(
        x,
        bins,
        right=right,
        labels=labels,
        precision=precision,
        include_lowest=include_lowest,
        duplicates=duplicates,
    )

    return _postprocess_for_cut(fac, bins, retbins, "Int64", x)
```

In the corrected `cut` function, the input array `x` is converted to a nullable integer array using `pd.array(x, dtype="Int64")`. This should handle missing values appropriately and avoid the ambiguity related to boolean comparisons with missing values.

It's important to test this correction thoroughly, including the original test cases and additional cases involving missing values, to ensure that the issue is resolved without introducing new problems.

Additionally, further investigation and modifications may be required in the other helper functions such as `_bins_to_cuts` to ensure consistent handling of missing values throughout the binning process.
