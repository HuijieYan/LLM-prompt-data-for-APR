    Bin values into discrete intervals.

    Use `cut` when you need to segment and sort data values into bins. This
    function is also useful for going from a continuous variable to a
    categorical variable. For example, `cut` could convert ages to groups of
    age ranges. Supports binning into an equal number of bins, or a
    pre-specified array of bins.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        The input array to be binned. Must be 1-dimensional.
    bins : int, sequence of scalars, or IntervalIndex
        The criteria to bin by.

        * int : Defines the number of equal-width bins in the range of `x`. The
          range of `x` is extended by .1% on each side to include the minimum and maximum values of `x`.
        * sequence of scalars : Defines the bin edges allowing for non-uniform width. No extension of the range of `x` is done.
        * IntervalIndex : Defines the exact bins to be used. Note that IntervalIndex for `bins` must be non-overlapping.

    right : bool, default True
        Indicates whether `bins` includes the rightmost edge or not. If `right == True` (the default), then the `bins` [1, 2, 3, 4] indicate (1,2], (2,3], (3,4]. This argument is ignored when `bins` is an IntervalIndex.
    labels : array or False, default None
        Specifies the labels for the returned bins. Must be the same length as the resulting bins. If False, returns only integer indicators of the bins. This affects the type of the output container (see below). This argument is ignored when `bins` is an IntervalIndex. If True, raises an error.
    retbins : bool, default False
        Whether to return the bins or not. Useful when bins is provided as a scalar.
    precision : int, default 3
        The precision at which to store and display the bins labels.
    include_lowest : bool, default False
        Whether the first interval should be left-inclusive or not.
    duplicates : {default 'raise', 'drop'}, optional
        If bin edges are not unique, raise ValueError or drop non-uniques.

    Returns
    -------
    out : Categorical, Series, or ndarray
        An array-like object representing the respective bin for each value of `x`. The type depends on the value of `labels`.

        * True (default) : returns a Series for Series `x` or a Categorical for all other inputs. The values stored within are Interval dtype.

        * sequence of scalars : returns a Series for Series `x` or a Categorical for all other inputs. The values stored within are whatever the type in the sequence is.

        * False : returns an ndarray of integers.

    bins : numpy.ndarray or IntervalIndex.
        The computed or specified bins. Only returned when `retbins=True`.
        For scalar or sequence `bins`, this is an ndarray with the computed
        bins. If set `duplicates=drop`, `bins` will drop non-unique bin. For an IntervalIndex `bins`, this is equal to `bins`.
