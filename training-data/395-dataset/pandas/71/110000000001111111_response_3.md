This function seems to have a bug related to handling the `right` and `include_lowest` parameters when the input `bins` is an integer. The function is not correctly adjusting the bins based on the `right` and `include_lowest` parameters.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly adjusting the calculated bins according to the `right` and `include_lowest` parameters when the input `bins` is an integer. This leads to incorrect bin creation and categorization.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly adjust the calculated bins based on the `right` and `include_lowest` parameters when the input `bins` is an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    # ... (existing documentation and parameters)

    # adjust the bins based on input parameters
    if not np.iterable(bins) and is_scalar(bins):
        if bins < 1:
            raise ValueError("`bins` should be a positive integer.")

        # perform binning calculations
        # adjust the bins based on right and include_lowest
        bins = np.histogram_bin_edges(x, bins, range=(x.min(), x.max()), right=right)

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```
