Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the code block that checks whether the index is integer-based or non-integer-based.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the code is not properly handling the different types of indexing (integer vs non-integer) for the `at` and `loc` operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fixing the bug is to handle the different types of indexing (integer vs non-integer) consistently for both `at` and `loc` operations. This may involve modifying the code block that checks the type of indexing and ensuring that the error messages are consistent for both operations.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not (ax.is_integer() or ax.is_floating()) and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
