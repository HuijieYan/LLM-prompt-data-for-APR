The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function within the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is designed to check if the index type matches the key type and then return the converted key. The bug is likely occurring due to an incorrect check for integer values in the key.

The error message from the test function indicates that the bug is related to non-integer indexing. The function should raise a `TypeError` if integer indexing is attempted on non-integer indexes, rather than raising a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_convert_key` function to correctly handle the cases when integer indexing is attempted on non-integer indexes.

Below is the corrected and modified code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:  # allow arbitrary setting
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or (ax.holds_integer() and not ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected function, the `ValueError` has been replaced with `TypeError` to ensure consistency with the expected behavior. The logic for handling integer and non-integer indexing has been adjusted to correctly identify and handle the cases when the key type does not match the index type.
