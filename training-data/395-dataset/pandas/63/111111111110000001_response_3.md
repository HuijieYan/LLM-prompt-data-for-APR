The test function 'test_series_at_raises_type_error' is checking the behavior of using the 'at' and 'loc' accessor methods on a Series object. It first checks if 'result' obtained from 'ser.at["a"]' is 1, then it does the same using 'ser.loc["a"]', followed by checking if an error is raised when using 'ser.at[0]' and 'ser.loc[0]'.

The potential error location within the problematic function '_convert_key' is the loop that iterates through the axes of the object and checks the type of the indexer 'i'. The code raises a ValueError if 'is_integer(i)' and the axis holds non-integer or is floating. This logic seems to be incorrect because it should allow integer indexers when the axis holds integer values. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to allow integer indexers when the axis holds integer values, and to raise an error only when a non-integer indexer is used. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function '_convert_key':

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not ax.is_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the modified code, 'not' is added before 'is_integer(i)' to allow integer indexers when the axis holds integer values, and the condition in the else block is simplified to allow non-integer indexers only when the axis is floating.
