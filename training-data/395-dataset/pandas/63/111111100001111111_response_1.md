Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring within the for loop in the `_convert_key` function, where it checks whether the index is a float or integer type.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function is not handling the conversion of the provided key properly and is not consistent with the behavior of `at` and `loc` methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic in the for loop to handle the conversion of the key based on the index type.
2. Ensure that the behavior of the `_convert_key` function is consistent with the `at` and `loc` methods to avoid inconsistent errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, (Int64Index, RangeIndex)) and not isinstance(i, (int, np.int_)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        elif not isinstance(ax, (Int64Index, RangeIndex)) and not isinstance(i, (str, int, float)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")

    return key
```
