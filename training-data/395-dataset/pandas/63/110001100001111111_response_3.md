The bug is likely occurring in the loop that iterates over the axes of the object. The code is attempting to check if the index is integer or not, and then raise ValueError based on that. The issue is with the condition `if ax.is_integer()` and the function calls `ax.holds_integer()` and `ax.is_floating()`. It seems these conditions are not correctly implemented and are causing inconsistent errors/messages between `loc` and `at`.

To fix the bug, the conditions need to be properly implemented to correctly identify if the index is integer or not, and then raise the ValueError accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.ObjectIndex)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The changes include using `isinstance` to check if the axis is of type `Int64Index` and `Float64Index` and then validate the index accordingly. Additionally, the condition to check if the index is integer or not has been corrected using `isinstance`. This should help in fixing the inconsistent errors/messages between `loc` and `at`.
