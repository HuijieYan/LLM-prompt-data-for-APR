Potential Error: The bug seems to be related to the handling of integer and non-integer indexes within the key.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking whether the key is an integer or non-integer index.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check the type of the index and handle integer and non-integer indexes accordingly.
2. Use the `is_integer` and `holds_integer` methods to determine the type of the index and validate the key against it.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
