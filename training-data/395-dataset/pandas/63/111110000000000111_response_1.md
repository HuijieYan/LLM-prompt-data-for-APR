Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the `_convert_key` function, where it's not handling the key appropriately for the `at` method.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function is not properly handling the key when using the `at` method. It is not checking the type of key and not matching it with the index type, which leads to inconsistent error messages while using `at` and `loc`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle the key for the `at` method and ensure it matches the index type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if isinstance(key, (int, str)):
        key = [key]
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
With this correction, the `_convert_key` function now properly handles the key for the `at` method and ensures it matches the index type, thus resolving the inconsistency in error messages between `at` and `loc`.
