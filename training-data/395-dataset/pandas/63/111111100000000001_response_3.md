The potential error in the function `_convert_key` is the usage of `is_integer` and `is_floating` without the appropriate context or class for these functions. These are likely custom methods that should be invoked on `ax` instead of being invoked directly.

The error occurs because the code is trying to call functions `is_integer` and `is_floating()` as standalone functions, and it seems that these functions are supposed to be methods of the `ax` object.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Assuming that `ax` is an instance of a custom class with methods `is_integer` and `is_floating`, you need to call these methods off the `ax` object.
2. Check if the method `is_integer` and `is_floating` exist in the class of `ax` before invoking them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if hasattr(ax, 'is_integer') and hasattr(ax, 'is_floating'):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not ax.is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if ax.is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
        else:
            # Handle the case when ax does not have is_integer and is_floating methods
            raise AttributeError("ax object does not have is_integer and is_floating methods")
    return key
```
