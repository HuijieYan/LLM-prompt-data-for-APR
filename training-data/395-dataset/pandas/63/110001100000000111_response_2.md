Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the _convert_key function in the pandas/core/indexing.py file. The function is not handling the key properly for at based indexing.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The _convert_key function is not properly checking for the type of index and key, leading to inconsistent behavior between at and loc indexing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of index and key to ensure consistency between at and loc indexing.
2. Handle integer and non-integer indexers appropriately based on the index type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code now properly checks the type of the index and key, ensuring consistent behavior between at and loc indexing.
