Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the condition where it checks if the index is integer or non-integer.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is likely occurring due to inconsistencies in how the `at` and `loc` methods handle indexing with integer or non-integer values. The `_convert_key` function is not handling this inconsistency properly, leading to different error messages for `at` and `loc` methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer indexers consistently for both `at` and `loc` methods.
2. Ensure that the error messages for both methods are clear and consistent when handling different types of indexers.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the type checking logic to ensure consistent handling of integer and non-integer indexers for both `at` and `loc` methods. Additionally, we have improved the error messages to provide clear and consistent feedback for different types of indexers.
