The bug in the provided function `_convert_key` is likely occurring due to the incorrect comparison of index types and mismatched conditions for integer and non-integer indexing.

The function loops through the axes of the object and checks the type of indexer. However, the conditions used to check the type of indexer are inconsistent and might not cover all possible scenarios.

To fix this bug, the conditions for checking the type of index and indexer need to be revised to cover all possible cases and ensure that the comparisons are accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
                if not isinstance(i, float):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if not isinstance(i, str):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on a string index "
                        "can only have string indexers"
                    )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we use `isinstance` to check the type of the index (`ax`) and the type of the indexer (`i`). This approach ensures that the correct conditions are used for each type of index, and the comparisons accurately reflect the type of the index and indexer.
