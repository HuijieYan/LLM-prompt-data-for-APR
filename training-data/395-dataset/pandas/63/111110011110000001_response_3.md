Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class, specifically in the part where it checks for the data type of the index and the key.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the method is not handling the case where the key and index have different data types properly. It raises a `ValueError` when it should actually be raising a `TypeError` since the type of the index is not compatible with the type of the key being passed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `_convert_key` method should be modified to handle the case where the index and key have different data types. The method should also be able to differentiate between integer and non-integer indexers and handle them accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not ax.inferred_type == type(i):
            raise TypeError("Index and key must have the same data type")
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise TypeError("At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers")
        if not ax.is_integer() and not ax.is_floating() and is_integer(i):
            raise TypeError("At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")
    return key
```
