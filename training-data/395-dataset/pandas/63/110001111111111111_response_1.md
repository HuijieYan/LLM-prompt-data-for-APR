The issue occurs when using the `at` and `loc` methods on a pandas Series. When using `at`, it raises a `ValueError` for non-integer index, while `loc` raises a `TypeError` for label indexing with integer indexers.

Upon analyzing the provided code, the potential location for the bug is the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The bug occurs because the function checks for whether the index is an integer or not, and raises a `ValueError` if the condition is not met. This leads to inconsistent error messages between `loc` and `at`, as observed in the GitHub issue description.

To fix this issue, the condition checks in the `_convert_key` function should be revised to ensure consistent behavior for both `at` and `loc` methods.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if not ax.equals(i):
            raise TypeError(
                f"cannot do label indexing on {type(ax)} "
                f"with these indexers {i} of {type(i)}"
            )
    return key
```

By using the `equals` method of the index, we can ensure consistent error messages for both `at` and `loc` methods. This fix addresses the issue of inconsistent errors between `loc` and `at` methods and ensures uniform behavior for label indexing.
