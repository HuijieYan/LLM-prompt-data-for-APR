The error occurs while trying to access the 'ser.at[0]' in the test function. This is invoking the '_convert_key' function internally with the key value of (0,) and 'is_setter' boolean value as False. 

The bug is likely in the 'for' loop in '_convert_key' function, where it is checking if 'i' is an integer for an axis that is non-integer. The function is meant to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index. 

The code should be modified to correctly validate the types of keys for the given index. 

Here's the corrected code for the '_convert_key' function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, str) and not (ax.is_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
            
        if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.is_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
``` 

This modification ensures that the function validates the key based on the type of the index.
