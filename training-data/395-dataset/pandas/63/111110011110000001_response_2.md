The error occurs when the `ser.at[0]` line is executed in the test function. The error message indicates that the `at` based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers. This error is raised from the `_convert_key` method within the `_AtIndexer` class.

The issue with the ` _convert_key` method is that it does not correctly handle the case when the key is an integer and the index is not an integer index. This results in a ValueError being raised when it should not.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method to handle the case when the index is not an integer index and the key is an integer. We can do this by adding a condition to check if the index is not an integer index and the key is an integer, and then allowing this operation to proceed as it does not contravene the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
            if is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the issue should be resolved and the test case should pass without raising a ValueError.
