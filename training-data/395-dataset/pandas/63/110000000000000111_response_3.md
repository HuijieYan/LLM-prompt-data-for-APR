Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the _convert_key method when using the at[] and loc[] methods for indexing.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the _convert_key method is not handling the at[] and loc[] methods consistently. The method is not properly checking the type of the index and is not providing consistent error messages for non-integer indexes.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The _convert_key method needs to be modified to handle both at[] and loc[] methods consistently. It should properly check the type of the index and provide consistent error messages for non-integer indexes.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
With the corrected code, the _convert_key method now properly handles both at[] and loc[] methods, checks the type of the index, and provides consistent error messages for non-integer indexes.
