# Analyzing the test case and its relationship with the error message

The test case `test_series_at_raises_type_error` is intended to check the behavior of the `at` accessor for a Series object. The test asserts that `ser.at[0]` should raise a TypeError with a specific error message. The error message indicates that there is inconsistency between `at` and `loc` indexing methods.

# Identifying the potential error location within the problematic function

The potential error location is within the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas.core.indexing` module.

# Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug

The bug occurs due to inconsistencies in error messages between `at` and `loc` indexing methods, which indicates that there are issues with type checking and the indexing behavior for the `_convert_key` function.

# Possible approaches for fixing the bug

1. Adjust the type checking and index handling logic within the `_convert_key` function to ensure that `at` and `loc` methods behave consistently.
2. Verify that the `_convert_key` function correctly handles integer and non-integer indexers based on the index type.

# Corrected code for the problematic function

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    idx_type = type(self.obj.index)
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for i in key:
        if not isinstance(i, idx_type):
            raise TypeError("cannot do label indexing on {} with these indexers {} of {}".format(idx_type, [i], type(i)))
            
    return key
```

The corrected code includes improved type checking and index handling logic, ensuring consistency between `at` and `loc` methods. Additionally, it explicitly checks the type of keys against the type of the index and raises a consistent `TypeError` message in case of a mismatch.
