The potential error location in the code is in the portion that checks if the indexer is an integer or not. The code compares using the function `is_integer()` which does not seem to be a valid function.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to check if the indexers are integers or not, but it is using a function that does not exist in Python.

To fix the bug, the code should use the `is_integer` function from the `numpy` library to check if the indexers are integers or not.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if np.issubdtype(type(i), np.integer):
            if not np.issubdtype(ax.dtype, np.integer):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if np.issubdtype(ax.dtype, np.integer) or np.issubdtype(ax.dtype, np.floating):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the fixed code, the `is_integer()` function is replaced with `np.issubdtype()` from the `numpy` library to check if the indexers and axis are integers.
