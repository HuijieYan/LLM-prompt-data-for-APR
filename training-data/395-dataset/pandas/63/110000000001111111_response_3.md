The bug is in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is intended to check if the key is a valid index for the object it is trying to index. 

The bug is likely occurring due to the mishandling of different index types (integer index and non-integer index). The function seems to be checking for the type of the index and the type of the key, but the logic may not be correct.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `_convert_key` method to properly handle the different index types and their corresponding keys. We should also ensure that the function raises consistent and accurate error messages for invalid key types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This fix involves using the `isinstance` function to check the type of the key instead of using the `is_integer` and `is_floating` methods. The corrected logic ensures that the key type is consistent with the index type and raises meaningful and consistent error messages when it is not.
