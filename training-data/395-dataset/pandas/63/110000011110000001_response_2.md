The test case `test_series_at_raises_type_error` is trying to access values from a Series using the `.at` accessor with integer indexers (e.g., `ser.at[0]`). The test is designed to raise a `TypeError` with a specific message when attempting to perform this type of operation.

The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` method within the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. It appears that the function is not handling integer indexers correctly, leading to a `ValueError` being raised when it encounters an integer indexer.

The reason for the bug is that the `_convert_key` method is checking the type of the index and the type of the indexer, but the conditions for integer and non-integer indexers are not being evaluated correctly.

To fix the bug, the conditions for checking the type of the index and the type of the indexer need to be adjusted to properly handle integer and non-integer indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i): # Check if the indexer is an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the `pd.api.types.is_integer` function is used to properly check if the indexer is an integer, and the conditions for handling integer and non-integer indexers are adjusted accordingly.
