The bug is in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The function is not correctly handling the case when the index is not an integer index. It is not correctly checking whether the index is an integer or not and is raising a `ValueError` in that case.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks the type of the index and the type of the key without considering the type of the values in the index and the key. This leads to inconsistent behavior between `at` and `loc` methods.

To fix the bug, the function should first check the type of the values in the index and the keys. If the values in the index are integers, it should only accept integer keys. If the values in the index are not integers, it should only accept non-integer keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    index_type = self.obj.index.dtype
    key_type = pd.Series(key).dtype
    
    if index_type == 'int64' and key_type != 'int64':
        raise ValueError(
            "At based indexing on an integer index "
            "can only have integer indexers"
        )
    elif index_type != 'int64' and key_type == 'int64':
        raise ValueError(
            "At based indexing on a non-integer "
            "index can only have non-integer "
            "indexers"
        )
    
    return key
```

Now the function checks the types of the index values and the key and raises the appropriate `ValueError` based on their types, ensuring consistent behavior between `at` and `loc` methods.
