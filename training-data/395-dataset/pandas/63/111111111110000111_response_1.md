The test case `test_series_at_raises_type_error` is testing the behavior of the `at` and `loc` methods on a Series. It sets up a Series with index 'a', 'b', and 'c', and then tries to access the value at index 0 using both `at` and `loc`. The error message indicates that the behavior of `at` and `loc` is different when accessing the value at index 0.

The bug is likely in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the IndexingMixin. The error message "At based indexing on an non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" indicates that the method is incorrectly handling indexing on non-integer indices.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method is not handling non-integer indices correctly and is raising a ValueError when it should be raising a TypeError to match the behavior of `loc`.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to be modified to handle non-integer indices correctly and raise a TypeError instead of a ValueError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
``` 

With this fix, the method now correctly raises a TypeError for non-integer indices, matching the behavior of `loc`.
