The test case is trying to compare the behavior of the `.at` and `.loc` methods for label indexing on a Series. The error message indicates that when using `.at[0]` on a non-integer index, a `ValueError` is raised instead of a `TypeError` which is expected to match the behavior of `.loc[0]`.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` method is where the `ValueError` is raised for non-integer indexes.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_convert_key` method is not handling the non-integer indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior between `.at` and `.loc`.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to handle the non-integer indexers in a way that matches the behavior of `.loc`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise TypeError(
                    "cannot do label indexing on <class 'pandas.core.indexes.base.Index'> "
                    f"with these indexers [{i}] of {type(i)}"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "cannot do label indexing on <class 'pandas.core.indexes.base.Index'> "
                    f"with these indexers [{i}] of {type(i)}"
                )
    return key
```
