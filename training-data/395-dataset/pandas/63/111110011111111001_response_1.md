Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the `raise ValueError` block.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code inside the `_convert_key` function is not handling the case where the index is non-integer and the indexer is an integer.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the axis is not an integer and the indexer is an integer, then raise a ValueError.
2. Ensure that the error message is descriptive and accurately reflects the nature of the issue.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    
    return key
```
