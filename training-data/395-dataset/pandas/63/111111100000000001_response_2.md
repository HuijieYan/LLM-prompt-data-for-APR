Potential error location: The loop that checks the type of each key element and raises a ValueError if it doesn't match the index type seems to be causing the issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to check for the type of each key element and raise a ValueError if the type doesn't match the index type. However, the condition checks for `ax.is_integer()` and `is_integer(i)`, which are not defined in the given context. It seems like the intended check is to verify if the types match, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `type` function to check if the type of `i` matches the type of the index element.
2. Use the `isinstance` function to check if `i` is an instance of the type of the index element.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if type(i) != type(ax):
            raise ValueError(
                "Key type doesn't match the index type"
            )
    return key
```
