The error occured at line 2099 in the `_convert_key` function defined in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is responsible for converting the given key into the appropriate format based on the index type. The error occurred because in the test case `test_series_at_raises_type_error`, the key "0" was passed to the `ser.at[0]` statement, which should not be allowed according to the indexing logic implemented in the `_convert_key` function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic inside the `_convert_key` function to check if the index is of integer type and if the given key is also an integer, then only integer indexers should be allowed. Otherwise, non-integer indexers should be allowed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()) and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this modification, the `_convert_key` function will correctly handle the scenario where an integer key is provided for a non-integer index and vice versa, preventing the occurrence of the ValueError as observed in the error message.
