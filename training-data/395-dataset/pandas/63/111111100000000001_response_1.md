Potential error location:
The potential error in the code lies in the logic used to check the type of the index when converting the key.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the type of the index when converting the key. The logic used to check the type of the index and the key is faulty.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix the bug is to properly handle the type of the index and the key. It may involve checking the type of the index and key separately and ensuring that they match or are compatible.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.dtype == np.float64 or ax.dtype == np.int64):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, we handle the different types of indices such as integer or non-integer indices and ensure that the keys are of compatible types. This approach ensures that the bug is fixed and the function works as intended.
