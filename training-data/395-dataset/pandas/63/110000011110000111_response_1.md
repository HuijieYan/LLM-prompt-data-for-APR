The error occurs when the `ser.at[0]` statement is executed in the test case. The error message states that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers," indicating that there is an inconsistency between the behavior of `at` and `loc` methods.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is the conditional check inside the second `else` block, where it throws a `ValueError` if the index is a non-integer. This is likely where the inconsistency between `at` and `loc` methods arises. The `loc` method throws a `TypeError` with a specific message, while the `at` method throws a `ValueError` with a different message.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_convert_key` function to only throw a `TypeError` with the appropriate message. This will ensure consistency across the `at` and `loc` methods.

Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "cannot do label indexing on "
                    f"{type(ax)} with these indexers {i} of {type(i)}"
                )
    return key
```

By making this change, the `_convert_key` function will consistently throw a `TypeError` for both `at` and `loc` methods when an incompatible index type is encountered.
