The test case `test_series_at_raises_type_error` is attempting to access elements of a series using the `.at` method and checking for expected behavior.

The error message indicates a `ValueError` being raised within the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. The error occurs when trying to retrieve the value at index 0 using `ser.at[0]`.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function does not handle the case where the key is an integer properly. It should check if the index type matches the key type.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `_convert_key` function to properly handle integer keys and index types. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif isinstance(i, (float, np.floating)):
            if not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported indexer type")

    return key
```

In this correction, we check if the key is an integer or float and then compare it with the index type, raising a `ValueError` if the types don't match. Additionally, we added a check for unsupported indexer types.
