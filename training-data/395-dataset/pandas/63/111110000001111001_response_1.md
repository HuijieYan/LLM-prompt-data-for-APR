The bug in the `_convert_key` function is due to the incorrect comparison and type checking logic. The function is intended to convert the input `key` to a specific type based on the type of the index. However, the current implementation is checking for types and comparisons incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the type checking based on the index. We also need to iterate over the keys and the index to perform the necessary comparisons.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.index, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected code, we are iterating over the `self.obj.index` (assuming `self.obj` is a DataFrame or Series) instead of `self.obj.axes` and performing type checking using the `isinstance` function. We are also using the `ax.is_integer()` method and comparing it with the type of the indexer `i` to correctly identify the type mismatch. This should fix the bug and handle the type comparison correctly.
