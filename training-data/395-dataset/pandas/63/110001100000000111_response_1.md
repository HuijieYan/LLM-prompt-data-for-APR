Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function when it checks for the type of the index and the type of the key to be used for indexing.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function is not correctly handling the type of index and key for indexing operations. It is not consistently handling integer and non-integer indexes and keys, leading to inconsistent errors when using `at` and `loc` methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and key to ensure consistency for both integer and non-integer indexes.
2. Use proper conditional statements to handle the type of the index and key for different indexing operations (`at` and `loc`).

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, type(self.obj.index)):
            if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (str, np.floating)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
        else:
            raise ValueError("Index type mismatch")
    return key
```
In the corrected code, I made changes to handle the type of the index and key for both integer and non-integer indexes. I used `isinstance` to check the type of the index and key and modified the conditional statements to handle different types of indexes and keys for `at` and `loc` operations.
