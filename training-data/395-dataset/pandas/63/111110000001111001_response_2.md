The given code defines a function `_convert_key` inside the class `_AtIndexer` which is used for converting the key. It checks the type of key elements based on specific conditions. The issue seems to be with the comparison of the type of the key with the index. 

Upon analyzing the error message for the variable `ax.holds_integer()` and `ax.is_floating()`, it appears that these methods are expected to be called directly on the `ax` object. However, the existing code does not invoke these methods on the `ax` object directly, leading to a possible bug. 

To fix this bug, the conditions for comparing the type of the key with the index can be modified by directly calling the methods `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` on the `ax` object. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
