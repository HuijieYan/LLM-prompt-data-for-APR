Potential Error: The function is trying to check whether the index keys are of the same type as the index, but it has a couple of issues. 

Reason for the Bug: 
1. There is a reference to the `is_integer()` function which is not defined in the code. 
2. There is a missing reference to the `is_integer()` function if it was meant to be a custom function.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `is_integer()` function within the class or import it if it's a built-in function from a library.
2. If `is_integer()` is meant to be a custom function, define it to check whether the key is an integer.
3. Update the logic to use the correct function for checking if a value is an integer.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int):
            if not isinstance(ax, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (isinstance(ax, int) or isinstance(ax, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
