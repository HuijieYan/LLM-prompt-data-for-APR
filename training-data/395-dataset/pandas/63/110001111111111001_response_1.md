The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The function is intended to convert the key to the same type as the index. The error message specifies that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

The issue is within the `for` loop where it attempts to check if the indexer `i` aligns with the type in the axes. The current approach to this validation is flawed, leading to an erroneous TypeError.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to update the logic within the for loop to correctly handle integer and non-integer indexers. The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:  # for non-integer indexes
            if not isinstance(i, (str, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This updated code ensures that the indexer `i` aligns with the type (integer or non-integer) in the axes, thereby resolving the bug.
