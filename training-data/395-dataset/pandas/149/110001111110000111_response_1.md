The error message indicates that the test is trying to open a file in read mode, but it is raising a FileNotFoundError because the file does not yet exist. This suggests that the issue may be with how the file is being opened or accessed in the `write` function.

The `write` function is using `get_filepath_or_buffer` to open the file, and the error occurs when it tries to open the file in read mode. This function is part of the `pandas/io/common.py` file, and the error is occurring in the `gcsfs.py` file.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is trying to open the file for reading when it should be opening it for writing. Additionally, the function does not handle the GCS file system case properly and may require additional checks and handling.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the opening of the GCS file, ensuring that it is opened in the appropriate mode for writing. Additionally, the function should check if the file already exists and handle the case where it does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if path.startswith("gs://"):
        import gcsfs
        fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem()
        with fs.open(path, 'wb') as f:
            # Pass the opened file to the fastparquet internal implementation
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: f
    else:
        from pandas.io.common import get_filepath_or_buffer
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, it handles the GCS file system case by using the `gcsfs` library to open the file in write mode, ensuring that it is ready for writing the Parquet data.
