The error in the buggy function seems to be related to the use of the `tostring()` method, which is deprecated. The error message "DeprecationWarning: tostring() is deprecated. Use tobytes() instead" suggests that the `tostring()` method should be replaced with `tobytes()`.

The potential error location is within the block of code where the `path` variable is being assigned a value based on the condition of whether the path is an S3 URL or not.

To fix the bug, the `tostring()` method should be replaced with `tobytes()` and the related code should be modified to use the correct method for opening the S3 file and passing it to the fastparquet internal implementation.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda p, mode: p.tobytes() 

    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, `tostring()` has been replaced with `tobytes()` and the lambda function for opening the S3 file now correctly uses the `tobytes()` method.
