The error occurred due to different modes being used with the file handling. The code tries to open the file in mode 'wb' when dealing with an s3 URL, but in the process, it ends up opening the file in mode 'rb'.

To fix this bug, the function should open the file using the same mode as specified in the code. Additionally, the function should return the corrected file path after opening the file in write mode.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        with open(path, "wb") as f:
            path = f
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        with open(path, "wb") as f:
            path = f

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )

    return path
```

In the corrected code, the file is opened using the "wb" mode for s3 URLs, and the returned file path is the opened file. The open method is used as a context manager to ensure that the file is closed after the block of code is executed.
