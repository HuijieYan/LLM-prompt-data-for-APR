The bug is occurring in the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class. It seems that the bug occurs when writing to a not-yet-existent GCS Parquet file. The `path` to the file is 'gs://test/test.csv', and it is attempting to open it with mode 'rb' instead of 'wb', which is causing a `FileNotFoundError`.

The reason behind the bug is that when writing to a new GCS Parquet file, the file needs to be opened with mode 'wb' to avoid the `FileNotFoundError`. However, the function is not handling this case correctly. 

To fix the bug, the function should check if the file exists and if not, it should be opened with mode 'wb'. Additionally, it should set the `write_index` and `partition_on` parameters based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` method:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")

        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        if not self.api.exists(path):
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        else:
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

With this modification, the function will check if the file exists, and if not, it will open the file with mode 'wb'. This should resolve the `FileNotFoundError` issue when trying to write to a not-yet-existent GCS Parquet file.
