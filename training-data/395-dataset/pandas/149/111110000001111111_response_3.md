Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the section where the path is processed, especially when it is an S3 path.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The error message indicating the deprecation of the `tostring()` method suggests that the code is using deprecated methods from a library or module, which could cause unexpected behavior.
2. The code seems to handle the S3 path differently, but it might not be doing so correctly, leading to the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace the deprecated `tostring()` method with `tobytes()` as suggested in the error message.
2. Ensure that the S3 path handling is consistent and correct for both writing and reading parquet files.

Corrected code:
```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, file_resource = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: file_resource
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
