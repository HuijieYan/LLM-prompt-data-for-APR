The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is being raised when trying to open a file in "r" mode, which is unexpected.

Looking at the provided code, the issue seems to be within the `write` method of the ParquetWriter class. The `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is raising a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file in "r" mode.

The potential reasons behind this bug could be that the filepath is not being handled correctly when using GCS as the filesystem. It seems that the GCS filesystem is not being used properly within the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function, leading to the `FileNotFoundError` exception.

To fix this, the GCS filesystem should be properly utilized within the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function. It seems that the MockGCSFileSystem is overriding the behavior of the GCS filesystem, so this should be adjusted to handle the "r" mode correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` method:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    elif is_gcs_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, an additional check for GCS URL has been included to properly handle the GCS filesystem. This should address the `FileNotFoundError` issue when trying to open the file in "r" mode.
