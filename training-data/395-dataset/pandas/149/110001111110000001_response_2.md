Given the error message, it seems that the test case `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` is trying to write a Parquet file to a GCS (Google Cloud Storage) path. However, it is encountering a `FileNotFoundError`, which indicates that the file or path may not exist.

The potential error location within the `write` function is likely the handling of the GCS path. It seems that the function is attempting to open the file in 'rb' mode, which is read-only, instead of 'wb' mode, which is write mode as required.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the code encounters a GCS path, it attempts to open the file in 'rb' mode, which is inappropriate for writing to a not-yet-existent GCS Parquet file.

To fix this bug, the `write` function should be modified to handle GCS paths correctly by opening the file in 'wb' mode instead of 'rb' mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
        self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
    ):
        self.validate_dataframe(df)
        
        if partition_cols is not None:
            kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"
        
        if is_s3_url(path):
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")  # Open the s3file in 'wb' mode for writing
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path  # Pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal implementation
        else:
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")  # Open the file in 'wb' mode for writing in case of GCS
        
        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            self.api.write(
                path,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
```

In the corrected code, the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is called with the `mode="wb"` parameter for both S3 and non-S3 paths, ensuring that the file is opened in write mode, which should resolve the `FileNotFoundError` issue for the GCS path.
