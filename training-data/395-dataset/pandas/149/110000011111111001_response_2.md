The error occurs during the `to_parquet` call on the DataFrame `df1`. The error message indicates a FileNotFoundError when the function attempts to open the path 'gs://test/test.csv' in mode 'rb'. The request should instead be to write mode, 'wb'.

The bug in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case of writing to a GCS file correctly. It doesn't open the file path in the correct mode and it doesn't handle the specific case of writing to GCS properly, resulting in the FileNotFoundError during the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the case of writing to a GCS file. This involves opening the file in 'wb' mode when writing to an S3 location, and passing the correct opened file to the fastparquet internal implementation.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, f_open = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        if is_s3_url(path):
            # Pass the opened file to the fastparquet internal implementation.
            kwargs["f"] = f_open
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

This corrected function addresses the issues of correctly opening the file in 'wb' mode when writing to an S3 location, and passing the opened file to the fastparquet internal implementation when writing to S3.
