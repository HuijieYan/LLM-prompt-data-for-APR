The buggy function `write` is attempting to write a DataFrame to a parquet file using the fastparquet library. The potential error location is the use of `kwargs` and its interaction with the `partition_cols` variable. 

The bug occurs because the code tries to handle the `partition_on` argument in `kwargs` separately from the `partition_cols` variable. This causes confusion and leads to incorrect behavior when these arguments are used together. 

To fix the bug, the code should handle the `partition_on` argument in `kwargs` consistently and ensure that it interacts properly with the `partition_cols` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    # Check if 'partition_on' is present in kwargs and handle it consistently
    if "partition_on" in kwargs:
        if partition_cols:
            raise ValueError("Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data")
        else:
            partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        # Set file_scheme to "hive" if partition_cols is not None
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # Handle 's3://' path
        with get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb") as s3file:
            # Pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: s3file
    else:
        # Handle non-s3 paths
        with get_filepath_or_buffer(path) as file:
            with catch_warnings(record=True):
                self.api.write(
                    file,
                    df,
                    compression=compression,
                    write_index=index,
                    partition_on=partition_cols,
                    **kwargs
                )
```

In the corrected code:
- The handling of the `partition_on` argument in `kwargs` has been made consistent.
- The `is_s3_url` function has been assumed to exist, and the usage of `get_filepath_or_buffer` has been modified to handle the file opening context manager properly. 
- The call to `self.api.write` has been moved into the non-S3 path handling block and is now correctly passing the file object for writing.

These adjustments should resolve the bug and ensure that the `write` function works as intended.
