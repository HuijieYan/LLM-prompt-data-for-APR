The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is being raised when trying to open a file in write mode using the `MockGCSFileSystem` class within the `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` test function.

The potential error in the code is likely related to the usage of the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function within the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class. The implementation of the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function seems to be causing the `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file in write mode.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is unable to handle the opening of a new file in write mode when using the `MockGCSFileSystem` class.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the implementation of the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function to handle the opening of new files under the `MockGCSFileSystem` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        # Modified code to open s3file using the correct mode
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        # Modify the get_filepath_or_buffer call to handle the opening of new files
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
In this corrected code, the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is called with the correct mode for opening new files under the `MockGCSFileSystem` class. This modification should address the `FileNotFoundError` issue encountered during the test.
