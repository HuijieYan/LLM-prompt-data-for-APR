The error occurs when the test function `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` tries to call the `to_parquet` method on the `df1` DataFrame object. The error indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is being raised when trying to open a file in mode "rb".

Looking at the `write` method provided, the issue might be related to the file opening logic. It seems that the path is being processed differently based on whether it's an S3 path or a regular file path. There might be a conditional branch that is incorrect or incomplete, leading to the wrong mode being used for file opening.

The bug occurs because when processing an S3 path, the logic attempts to open the file in "wb" mode instead of "w" mode. Additionally, the `open_with` parameter is set to a lambda function that doesn't align with this mode of opening. As a result, when the actual write operation is attempted later, it fails with a `FileNotFoundError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for processing S3 paths and opening the corresponding files.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` method:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'w' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: fs.open(path, "w")
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
       )
```

In the corrected code, the mode for opening S3 files is changed to "w", and the `open_with` parameter is set to a lambda function that aligns with this mode. This should address the `FileNotFoundError` issue encountered in the test case.
