The error in the provided function seems to be related to the use of the `tostring()` method, which has been deprecated and should be replaced with `tobytes()`.

It appears that the bug is occurring in the section where the s3 path is being processed. The lambda function passed to the `open_with` argument is using the deprecated `tostring()` method.

To fix the bug, the lambda function should be updated to use the `tobytes()` method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda f: f.getvalue()
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the lambda function in the s3 path processing section has been updated to use the `getvalue()` method to convert the s3 file to bytes, replacing the use of the deprecated `tostring()` method.
