The error message is indicating a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open a file for writing, which suggests that the file does not exist at the specified path.

The potential error in the problematic function is the handling of file paths when writing to GCS. It seems that the file path is not being handled correctly, which leads to the `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file for writing.

The bug is occurring because the file path is not being properly processed or constructed before attempting to open the file for writing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file path is properly constructed and handled before attempting to open the file for writing. This may involve checking the validity of the GCS path, handling the creation of the file if it does not exist, and ensuring that the necessary permissions are in place.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        if not gcs.exists(path):
            with gcs.open(path, "w") as f:
                f.write(b"")  # Create the file

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the GCS file exists. If it does not exist, we create the file before opening it for writing. This should prevent the `FileNotFoundError` from occurring.
