## Analysis
The error occurs when trying to write a DataFrame to a Parquet file located on a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and opens the file in 'rb' (read binary) mode instead of 'wb' (write binary) mode.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely in the conditional statement that handles whether the path is an S3 URL or not and the subsequent handling of the file mode.

## Reason for the Bug
The logic for handling the file mode when the path is an S3 URL is incorrect, resulting in the file being opened in 'rb' mode instead of 'wb' mode, which is needed for writing to the file.

## Possible Approaches
1. Update the logic for handling S3 URLs to explicitly check for the write mode and handle it accordingly.
2. Ensure that the GCS file system is correctly handling the file mode when opening the file.

## Corrected Code
```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"
    
    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
With this correction, the function now correctly handles S3 URLs and GCS paths, ensuring that the file is opened in the appropriate write mode for Parquet file writing.
