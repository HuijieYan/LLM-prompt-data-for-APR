The error occurs in the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class. The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is raised when trying to open the file for writing.

The potential error location is within the `write` method where the file is processed before writing to it.

The bug occurs because the file opening mode is set to "rb" instead of "wb" when attempting to open the file for writing. This causes the FileNotFoundError to be raised as the code cannot find the file in read mode.

To fix the bug, the opening mode of the file should be set to "wb" when dealing with the GCS file system.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` method:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        # Set mode to 'wb' for writing to GCS file system
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In this corrected code, the mode is explicitly set to 'wb' when opening the file for writing to the GCS file system. This should resolve the FileNotFoundError issue described in the error message.
