Potential Error Location: 
The potential error location is within the write function, specifically at the point where the function is trying to open the s3file in 'wb' mode when the path is an S3 URL.

Reason for Bug:
The bug arises due to the use of a deprecated method "tostring()" instead of "tobytes()" in the function call, which triggers a DeprecationWarning. Additionally, there are issues with handling partition columns and paths for S3 URLs.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace the deprecated method "tostring()" with "tobytes()".
2. Properly handle the "partition_on" and "partition_cols" parameters.
3. Correctly open the s3file in 'wb' mode when the path is an S3 URL.

Corrected Code:
```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        s3file, mode = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        with s3file, s3file.open(mode) as f:
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: f
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
