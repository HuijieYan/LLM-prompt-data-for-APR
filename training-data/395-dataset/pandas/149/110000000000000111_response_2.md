The code is trying to write a dataframe to a file using the `write` function. The potential error location within the function could be related to the handling of the `kwargs` (keyword arguments) and the specific conditions related to writing the file based on the path.

The bug in the code is that it is checking for the presence of "partition_on" in `kwargs` and updating `partition_cols` accordingly, but it is not handling the case when "partition_on" is not in `kwargs`. This leads to an inconsistency in the usage of `partition_cols`.

To fix the bug, the code should check for "partition_on" in `kwargs` and use `partition_cols` if it exists, otherwise, default to `None`.

Another potential issue is the handling of file paths. The code is trying to open an s3 file in write mode but does not support 'ab' mode. This needs to be addressed as well.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    partition_on = kwargs.pop("partition_on", None)

    if partition_on and partition_cols:
        raise ValueError("Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data")

    if partition_on:
        partition_cols = partition_on

    if partition_cols:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        mode = "wb"  # Set the default mode to write
        if "mode" in kwargs:
            mode = kwargs.pop("mode")

        if mode not in ["wb", "ab"]:
            raise ValueError("Invalid mode for S3 file. Supported modes are 'wb' and 'ab'.")

        # Open the s3 file
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode=mode)
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `partition_on` in `kwargs` is properly handled and popped if it exists, defaulting to `None` if it doesn't.
2. The handling of file paths for s3 is updated to check for the mode and provide an appropriate error if an unsupported mode is used.
