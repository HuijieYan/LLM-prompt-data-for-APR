The test function `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` is trying to write a DataFrame to a GCS Parquet file using the `to_parquet` method.

The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is being raised while trying to open a file in 'r' (read) mode. This error is likely occurring within the `open` method of the `MockGCSFileSystem` class, which is called when trying to open the file to write to.

The bug in the provided function is that the `path` is being constructed as `'gs://test/test.csv'`, but it should be referring to a Parquet file, not a CSV file. Additionally, there is an issue with the file mode when opening the file.

To fix the bug, the path should be constructed as "gs://test/test.parquet" instead of "gs://test/test.csv". Also, the mode when opening the file should be 'wb' (write binary) mode.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    # thriftpy/protocol/compact.py:339:
    # DeprecationWarning: tostring() is deprecated.
    # Use tobytes() instead.

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")  # Updated to use mode="wb" here.

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
