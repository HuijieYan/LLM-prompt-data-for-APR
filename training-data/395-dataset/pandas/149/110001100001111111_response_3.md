The bug in the provided function is likely related to the use of the `open_with` lambda function and the handling of the `path` variable when it is an S3 URL. Additionally, the function may also have issues with the handling of the `kwargs` dictionary.

The function tries to open the `path` in write mode when it is an S3 URL, and then define the `open_with` lambda function to pass the opened file to the fastparquet internal implementation. However, the current implementation likely results in an error due to incorrect handling of the file opening and passing process.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the S3 URL case properly by opening the file in write mode and defining the `open_with` lambda function. Additionally, the function should handle the `kwargs` dictionary more consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # Handle S3 URL case
        with fs.open(path, 'wb') as f:
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda _: f
    else:
        # Handle non-S3 URL case
        with get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb") as f:
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda _: f

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, we use `fs.open` to open the S3 path in write mode and `get_filepath_or_buffer` to open non-S3 paths in write mode, and then define the `open_with` lambda function to pass the opened file to the fastparquet internal implementation. This should resolve the issues related to handling the file opening and passing process. Additionally, we maintain consistent handling of the `kwargs` dictionary throughout the function.
