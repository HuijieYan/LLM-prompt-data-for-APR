The error message in the bug description indicates a deprecation warning for the `tostring()` function, which has been replaced by `tobytes()`.

The potential error is likely to be in the `write` function, specifically in the code where a Lambda function is defined for `open_with`. Additionally, the `tostring()` function is likely being used in the `fastparquet` module, which is deprecated.

The bug occurred because the `tostring()` function is deprecated, and it needs to be replaced with the `tobytes()` function.

To fix the bug, the code for the `open_with` lambda function should be updated to use the `tobytes()` function instead of the `tostring()` function. Additionally, any other instances of the `tostring()` function within the function should be replaced with `tobytes()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda f: f.tobytes()
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
In this corrected code, the Lambda function for `open_with` now uses `tobytes()` instead of `tostring()`, fixing the deprecation warning.
