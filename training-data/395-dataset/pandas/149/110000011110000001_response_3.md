The error occurs when trying to write a Parquet file to a GCS path that does not exist. The issue seems to be with the handling of the file path in the `write` function. The error message indicates that a file not found error is being raised.

The potential error location is within the `write` function, specifically in the handling of the file path and the method used to open the file, as well as the possibility of incorrectly handling the `kwargs` parameters.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the file path for GCS (Google Cloud Storage) URLs, and it may not be passing the correct mode for opening the file in certain cases.

To fix the bug, the `kwargs` parameters need to be handled correctly and the file path for GCS URLs should be opened in write mode when the file does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings
import os
import gcsfs
from pandas.api.types import is_s3_url
from fastparquet import write as fastparquet_write
from fastparquet import ParquetFile

def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem()
        parquet_file = gcsfs.GCSMap(path, fs=fs)

        gcs_path = os.path.join(parquet_file.root, "data.parquet")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True):
            fastparquet_write(gcs_path, df, compression=compression, file_scheme="hive", write_index=index, partition_on=partition_cols, **kwargs)
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = ParquetFile.get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

        with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True):
            fastparquet_write(path, df, compression=compression, file_scheme="hive", write_index=index, partition_on=partition_cols, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code:
- The GCS path handling uses the `gcsfs` library to open the GCS path in write mode.
- The `fastparquet_write` function is used to write the Parquet file to the specified path.
