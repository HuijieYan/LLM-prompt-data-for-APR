The error stems from the `MockGCSFileSystem` class which raises a `FileNotFoundError` when `mode` does not contain the letter "w". This error occurs when writing to a GCS Parquet file, as the file does not exist yet.

This issue could be resolved by allowing the creation of the Parquet file if it does not exist, instead of raising a `FileNotFoundError`. Additionally, it is important to ensure proper handling of the file opening and writing process when dealing with GCS (Google Cloud Storage) file systems.

Here is the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError("Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data")
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # Handle path for S3
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        # Handle path for GCS
        fs = GCSFileSystem()
        if not fs.exists(path):
            fs.touch(path)
    
    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the GCS file system is explicitly checked for the existence of the file at the specified path. If the file does not exist, it is created using the `fs.touch(path)` method. This ensures that the file can be opened for writing in a mode that allows the file to be created if it does not exist. This approach addresses the FileNotFoundError issue and enables writing to non-existent GCS Parquet files.
