The potential error in the function is the use of `self.validate_dataframe(df)` without the correct syntax for calling a class method.

The error occurred because the `self.validate_dataframe(df)` is not being called correctly as a method of the class. Instead, it should be called as `validate_dataframe(df)`.

To fix the bug, the `self.validate_dataframe(df)` should be changed to `validate_dataframe(df)`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_149/pandas/io/parquet.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def validate_dataframe(df):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def write(self, df, path, compression, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def write(self, df, path, compression='snappy', coerce_timestamps='ms', index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def write(self, df, path, compression='snappy', index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the fixed function
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    validate_dataframe(df)  # fix: Removed "self." prefix
    # thriftpy/protocol/compact.py:339:
    # DeprecationWarning: tostring() is deprecated.
    # Use tobytes() instead.
    # ... remaining code remains the same ...
```
By removing the "self." prefix from `validate_dataframe(df)`, the function call is now correct and should work as intended.
