Potential error location: The code is trying to pop the "partition_on" key from the kwargs dictionary, but it's not checking if the key actually exists in the dictionary.

Reasons for the bug:
The code is assuming that "partition_on" key will always exist in the kwargs dictionary, which may not be the case. This can lead to a KeyError if the key does not exist.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
Check if the key "partition_on" exists in the kwargs dictionary before trying to pop it. If it exists, then assign its value to partition_cols.

Corrected code:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    partition_on = kwargs.pop("partition_on", None)

    if partition_on is not None and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif partition_on is not None:
        partition_cols = partition_on

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
