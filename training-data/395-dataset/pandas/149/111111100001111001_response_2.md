The error in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the 'open_with' key in the kwargs and its value. The code tries to check if 'partition_on' is in the kwargs and then pop it, but doesn't handle the 'open_with' key appropriately.

The buggy function tries to handle different scenarios based on the input parameters, but it doesn't handle the 'open_with' key properly. It checks for the presence of 'partition_on' in kwargs and tries to pop it if it exists, but doesn't handle the 'open_with' key in the same way.

To fix the bug, we should handle the 'open_with' key similarly to 'partition_on' if it exists in the kwargs. Additionally, we should ensure that the handling of the 'open_with' key is consistent with the rest of the code in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(
        self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
    ):
        self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
        if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Cannot use both partition_on and "
                "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
                "partitioning data"
            )
        elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
            partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")
    
        if "open_with" in kwargs:
            open_func = kwargs.pop("open_with")
        else:
            open_func = None
    
        if partition_cols is not None:
            kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"
    
        if is_s3_url(path):
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: open_func(path, _)
        else:
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)
    
        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            self.api.write(
                path,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
```
