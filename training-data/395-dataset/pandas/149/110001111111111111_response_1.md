The error seems to be occurring at the point where the `df1.to_parquet` method is being called. This method is trying to open the file in write mode and is raising a `FileNotFoundError`. Looking at the function provided, the issue likely lies with the `write` method and how it handles file paths, particularly when it has to open a file to write data into it.

The bug seems to be originating from the handling of the file path and the file open mode. The `get_filepath_or_buffer` method is being used to open the file for writing, but it seems to be encountering an issue.

One of the potential reasons for this issue could be that the file path for the GCS file is ending up in read mode instead of write mode, due to an improper handling or transformation of the path in the `write` method.

To fix this bug, we can modify the write method to directly handle the file path and open the file for writing in the case of a GCS path. We need to ensure the correct mode is being used for opening the file (write instead of read).

Additionally, it might be beneficial to handle the file path and mode directly within a try-except block to catch and handle any potential file-related errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` method:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if path.startswith('gs://'):
        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            with self.api.open(path, "wb") as f:
                self.api.write(
                    f,
                    df,
                    compression=compression,
                    write_index=index,
                    partition_on=partition_cols,
                    **kwargs
                )
    else:
        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            self.api.write(
                path,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the file path starts with 'gs://' indicating it is a GCS path. If it is, we open the file using the `open` method of the GCS file system with the "wb" mode. If the path is not for GCS, it goes through the existing logic to open the file for writing. This way, we ensure that the file is opened in the correct mode for writing, preventing the `FileNotFoundError` that was occurring previously.
