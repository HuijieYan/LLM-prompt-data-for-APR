1. The test case is trying to write a DataFrame to a Parquet file stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using the 'fastparquet' engine. It seems to be encountering a FileNotFoundError when trying to open the file.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the path variable passed to the get_filepath_or_buffer function and the subsequent handling of the path.

3. The error occurs because the function is trying to open the specified path with the 'rb' mode, which is for reading. However, since the intention is to write to the file, it should be opened with the 'wb' (write binary) mode instead. This mismatch of file opening modes is likely causing the FileNotFoundError.

4. A possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the file opening mode based on the intent of the operation (writing). Additionally, proper handling of the opening process for GCS paths should be ensured to avoid discrepancies in file access.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        # Adjust the open mode for GCS write operation
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the file opening mode for paths is adjusted based on the storage type, ensuring that the appropriate mode is used for writing. This should resolve the FileNotFoundError issue encountered in the test case.
