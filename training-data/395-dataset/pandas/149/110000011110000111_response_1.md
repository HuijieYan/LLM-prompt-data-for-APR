The test case `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` is trying to write a DataFrame to a GCS Parquet file. It creates a `MockGCSFileSystem` class with an `open` method that raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the file mode does not include 'w' (write). 

The error message indicates that when `df1.to_parquet` is called, it tries to open the file in read mode ('rb'), which triggers the `FileNotFoundError` in the `MockGCSFileSystem` class. This is likely due to incorrect handling of the file mode in the `write` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `df.to_parquet` method calls the `write` method with the correct file mode to open the GCS file for writing.

The corrected code for the `write` method:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")  # Update mode to 'wb' for writing

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `get_filepath_or_buffer` call for the non-S3 case has been updated to open the file in write mode (`mode="wb"`) to ensure that the file is opened for writing. This should resolve the issue and allow the test case to write the DataFrame to the GCS Parquet file without encountering a `FileNotFoundError`.
