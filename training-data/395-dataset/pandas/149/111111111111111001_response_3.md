The error message indicates that a FileNotFoundError occurred while trying to open a file in read mode. This error is likely related to the use of the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function within the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class.

The code attempts to open a file for writing, but there is an issue with how the file path is handled. The get_filepath_or_buffer function is being used to extract the file path, and it seems to be attempting to open the file in read mode instead of write mode.

This bug can be fixed by modifying the get_filepath_or_buffer call to ensure that the file is opened in write mode when writing to it. Additionally, any unnecessary checks for opening in read mode should be removed because it might lead to errors.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression='snappy', index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")  # Modify to open in write mode
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")  # Modify to open in write mode

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

By ensuring that the file is opened in write mode when using `get_filepath_or_buffer`, this corrected function should prevent the FileNotFoundError that was occurring.
