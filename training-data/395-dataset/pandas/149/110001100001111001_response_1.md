Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the section of the code where the function tries to open an s3file in 'wb' mode if the path is an S3 URL.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The error message "DeprecationWarning: tostring() is deprecated. Use tobytes() instead." indicates that the code is using a deprecated method, which needs to be replaced with the updated method. Additionally, the code may have issues with handling S3 URLs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace the deprecated method `tostring()` with `tobytes()`.
2. Ensure proper handling of S3 URLs by opening the s3file in 'wb' mode when the path is an S3 URL.

Corrected Code
```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")
    
    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"
    
    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        path, _, _, mode = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, mode = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)
    
    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
