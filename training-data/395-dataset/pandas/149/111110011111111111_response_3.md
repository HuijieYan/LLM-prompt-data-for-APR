Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `MockGCSFileSystem` class when trying to open the file in write mode. This issue is due to the missing implementation for opening the file in write mode.

Reason for the bug: The buggy function `write` in the `FastParquetImpl` class does not handle opening the file in write mode when using GCS filesystem.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement a method to handle opening the file in write mode for the GCS filesystem.
2. Update the `write` function to utilize the method for handling GCS filesystem and opening the file in write mode.

Corrected code for the `write` function in the `FastParquetImpl` class:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    elif is_gcs_url(path):
        # path is a GCS URL, so implement the opening of the file in write mode.
        fs = GCSFileSystem()
        with fs.open(path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(b"")  # Create a temporary file to allow write operation
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # Pass the opened GCS file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `write` function now includes a branch to handle GCS filesystem. Upon detecting a GCS URL, it creates a temporary file to allow write operation and passes the opened GCS file to the internal implementation. This ensures that the GCS filesystem is handled appropriately when opening the file in write mode.
