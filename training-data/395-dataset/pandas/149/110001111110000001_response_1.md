The error message indicates that a FileNotFoundError is being raised within the `open` method of the `MockGCSFileSystem` class. This is happening when `df1.to_parquet` is being called in the test function. The problem occurs when trying to create a new parquet file, as the function seems to check for the existence of the file and raise a FileNotFoundError when it is not found.

The potential error location within the `write` function is the following block of code:
```python
path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)
```
The `get_filepath_or_buffer` function might be checking for the existence of the file and raising a FileNotFoundError when it is not found.

To fix this issue, the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function should be modified to handle the scenario where the file does not exist. Instead of raising a FileNotFoundError, it should create the file if it doesn't exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    # Instead of raising a FileNotFoundError, create the file if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        with open(path, 'w'):
            pass

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

By adding the check for file existence and creating the file if it doesn't exist, we ensure that the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function does not raise a FileNotFoundError when trying to write to a non-existent file.
