Apologies, it seems there's a misunderstanding. It appears that the "MockGCSFileSystem" class was used in the test case to simulate file operations with the GCSFileSystem. The issue is likely not related to the `MockGCSFileSystem` class, and the bug is likely within the `write` method in the `FastParquetImpl` class of the `parquet.py` file.

Here is the corrected code for the `write` method in the `FastParquetImpl` class:

```python
class FastParquetImpl(BaseImpl):
    # ... other methods ...

    def write(
        self, df, path, compression='snappy', index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
    ):
        validate_dataframe(df)  # Use the correct function name for validation

        if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Cannot use both partition_on and "
                "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
                "partitioning data"
            )
        elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
            partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

        if partition_cols is not None:
            kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

        if is_s3_url(path):
            # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
            # TODO: Support 'ab'

            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
            # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
        else:
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            self.api.write(
                path,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
```

I have corrected the method name for validating the dataframe (`validate_dataframe`), assuming it's a method from the same class or imported from a module. If not, please replace it with the correct validation method for the dataframe.

Please also make sure that other methods and variables are correctly imported or defined in the `FastParquetImpl` class.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
