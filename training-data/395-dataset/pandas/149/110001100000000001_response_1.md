The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `validate_dataframe(df)` method, as this method has not been defined in the provided code. This could lead to a NameError when attempting to call the `validate_dataframe` method.

To fix this bug, the `validate_dataframe(df)` method should be defined in the code.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_149/pandas/io/parquet.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def validate_dataframe(df):
    # Add implementation to validate the dataframe
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def write(self, df, path, compression, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function after fixing the bug
def write(self, df, path, compression='snappy', coerce_timestamps='ms', index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    validate_dataframe(df)
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def write(self, df, path, compression='snappy', index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
```
