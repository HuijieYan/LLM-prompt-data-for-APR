The error message is an indication that the `FileNotFoundError` is being raised when trying to open the file in write mode. This suggests that the incorrect file path or mode is being used.

The problematic function in this case is the `write` method in the `FastParquetImpl` class from the `parquet.py` file. The error occurs because when writing to a GCS Parquet file, the file path and mode for opening the file are not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, the file path and mode for opening the file need to be handled properly based on whether the file is located in GCS or not.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `write` method:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if path.startswith('gs://'):
        # path is in GCS, so we need to open the GCS file in 'wb' mode.
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened GCS file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, we validate the file path for GCS and open the file using the correct mode based on whether it's a GCS file or not. This should resolve the `FileNotFoundError` that was being raised.
