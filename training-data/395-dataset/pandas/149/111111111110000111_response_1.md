The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is being raised when trying to open the file in write mode. This suggests that the file does not exist. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code where it's checking for the presence of the file and handling it when the path is an s3 URL. The issue might be related to the way the file is being handled or checked for existence, especially in the case when the path is an s3 URL.

The reason behind the bug is the incorrect handling of the file existence check and path when it's an s3 URL.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case when the path is an s3 URL properly, and check for the file's existence in a way that doesn't raise a `FileNotFoundError`. This can be achieved by updating the file handling and existence check logic.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    # Handle s3 URL path
    if path.startswith('s3://'):
        import s3fs
        fs = s3fs.S3FileSystem()
        with fs.open(path, 'wb') as f:
            pass  # Do nothing, just open the file to create it

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the s3 URL case is explicitly handled using `s3fs` to open the file in write mode and create it if it doesn't exist. This should address the `FileNotFoundError` issue and correctly handle the file path when it's an s3 URL.
