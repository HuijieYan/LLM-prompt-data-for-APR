The error occurs when the `df1.to_parquet` function is being called, which internally calls the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class, leading to the `FileNotFoundError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where the path is being opened using the `get_filepath_or_buffer` and the file is created if it doesn't exist.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `get_filepath_or_buffer` is trying to open the file in mode 'rb' ('r' for read and 'b' for binary) which is causing the FileNotFoundError because the file doesn't exist yet.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to handle the scenario where the file doesnâ€™t exist, create the file, and then open it in write mode ('wb' for write and binary) to avoid the FileNotFoundError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError("Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data")
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        with open(path, "wb") as s3file:  # Create and open the file in write mode
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: s3file
    else:
        with open(path, "wb") as local_file:  # Create and open the file in write mode
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(local_file)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is replaced with opening the file using the `open` function in write mode ('wb') when the file doesn't exist. This would allow the function to create the file before it is opened, thus preventing the FileNotFoundError.
