The error lies in the function `from_codes` of the `Categorical` class. 
The function is attempting to use a class attribute `CategoricalDtype` instead of an instance attribute. This is evident from the fact that `CategoricalDtype` is being used as if it were a class attribute, but it should be an instance attribute.

The issue appears to be occurring due to the incorrect usage of the `CategoricalDtype` class. It seems that the function should create an instance of the `CategoricalDtype` instead of using it directly as a class.

The corrected code for the `from_codes` function is as follows:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    dtype = CategoricalDtype(categories=categories, ordered=ordered)
    if categories is None and dtype.categories is None:
        msg = "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or 'dtype'. Both were None."
        raise ValueError(msg)

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

This modification ensures that the `CategoricalDtype` is used as an instance attribute and also checks if the categories are provided in either the `categories` or `dtype` parameter.
