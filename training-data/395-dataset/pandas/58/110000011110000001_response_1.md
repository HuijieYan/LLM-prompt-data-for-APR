The error message indicates that the code is expecting the 'codes' input to be an array-like of integers, but the input received is an array-like of objects. This is resulting in a ValueError.

The bug is occurring because the 'codes' input is expected to be an array-like of integers, but it is being received as an array-like of objects.

To fix this bug, the 'codes' input needs to be converted to an array-like of integers before the function proceeds with the validation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    """
    Make a Categorical type from codes and categories or dtype.

    This constructor is useful if you already have codes and
    categories/dtype and so do not need the (computation intensive)
    factorization step, which is usually done on the constructor.

    If your data does not follow this convention, please use the normal
    constructor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    codes : array-like of int
        An integer array, where each integer points to a category in
        categories or dtype.categories, or else is -1 for NaN.
    categories : index-like, optional
        The categories for the categorical. Items need to be unique.
        If the categories are not given here, then they must be provided
        in `dtype`.
    ordered : bool, optional
        Whether or not this categorical is treated as an ordered
        categorical. If not given here or in `dtype`, the resulting
        categorical will be unordered.
    dtype : CategoricalDtype or "category", optional
        If :class:`CategoricalDtype`, cannot be used together with
        `categories` or `ordered`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0
           When `dtype` is provided, neither `categories` nor `ordered`
           should be provided.
    Returns
    -------
    Categorical
    """
    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
        categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
    )
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = (
            "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
            "'dtype'. Both were None."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    codes = pd.array(codes, dtype=int)  # Convert `codes` to array-like of integers
    if len(codes) and not is_integer_dtype(codes):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be array-like integers")

    if len(codes) and (codes.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes.min() < -1):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```

This corrected code includes the conversion of the 'codes' input to an array-like of integers using `pd.array(codes, dtype=int)`. This should resolve the issue of receiving an array-like of objects and ensure that the function expects array-like integers as input.
