The error message in the test_from_codes_with_nullable_int function suggests that the issue is related to codes not being array-like integers. The error occurs in the from_codes method of the Categorical class.

The issue arises because the from_codes method expects the codes parameter to be an array-like of integers, but with the introduction of the new nullable Int64 dtype, the method is unable to handle the new dtype effectively, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the from_codes method to handle the new nullable Int64 dtype effectively.

Here's the corrected from_codes method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
        categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
    )
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = (
            "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
            "'dtype'. Both were None."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    codes = pd.array(codes, dtype=dtype)  # Using pd.array to handle nullable Int64 dtype

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```

By using pd.array to handle the nullable Int64 dtype, we can ensure that the from_codes method can effectively handle the new dtype.

This fix should address the issue and allow the from_codes method to work with the new nullable Int64 dtype effectively.
