The error message "ValueError: codes need to be array-like integers" suggests that there is a problem with the data type of the `codes` parameter in the `from_codes` method. The method expects the `codes` to be array-like integers, but it seems to be failing when the input is of type "Int64".

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue is with the line:
```python
codes = np.asarray(codes)  # #21767
```
The `np.asarray` function converts the input to an array, but it may not handle the input of type "Int64" correctly, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this issue, the code can be modified to handle the conversion of "Int64" to array-like integers appropriately. One way to achieve this is by converting the "Int64" type to a regular integer type before using `np.asarray`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
        categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
    )
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = (
            "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
            "'dtype'. Both were None."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    if not isinstance(codes, (np.ndarray, pd.Series)):
        codes = np.array(codes, dtype="int")

    if len(codes) and (codes.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes.min() < -1):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```

In this corrected function, we first check if the `codes` parameter is not an instance of `np.ndarray` or `pd.Series`, and if so, we convert it to a NumPy array with a dtype of "int" to ensure that it contains array-like integers. This should handle the issue with "Int64" type causing the ValueError.
