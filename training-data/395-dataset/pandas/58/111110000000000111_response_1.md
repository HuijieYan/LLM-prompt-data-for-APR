The test case provided is trying to create a categorical variable using the `from_codes` method and passing a Series with the dtype as "Int64" as input. This is resulting in a ValueError with the message "codes need to be array-like integers".

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
if len(codes) and not is_integer_dtype(codes):
    raise ValueError("codes need to be array-like integers")
```

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the code is explicitly checking if the `codes` input is of integer type using the `is_integer_dtype()` function. Since the input is of dtype "Int64", it is not being recognized as an array-like integer, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for the integer type to account for the "Int64" dtype as well. We can use the `pd.api.types.is_integer` function to verify if the dtype is an integer type, including "Int64".

Here's the corrected code for the `from_codes` function:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
        categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
    )
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = (
            "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
            "'dtype'. Both were None."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    codes = np.asarray(codes)  # #21767
    if len(codes) and not pd.api.types.is_integer(codes):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be array-like integers")

    if len(codes) and (codes.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes.min() < -1):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```
