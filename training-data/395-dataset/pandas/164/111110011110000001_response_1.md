The error message states that the `tm.assert_equal()` function found a difference in the `dtype` attribute for `DatetimeIndex` and `DatetimeArray`. This suggests that the bug is likely in the `to_datetime` function.

Upon analyzing the `to_datetime` function, the issue seems to arise from the handling of time zones. It appears that the function is not properly converting the time zone to UTC, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

To fix this bug, the `to_datetime` function should ensure that time zones are accurately converted to UTC. Additionally, it should handle the time zone conversion for both `DatetimeIndex` and `DatetimeArray` objects appropriately.

Here's the corrected `to_datetime` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import classes as np_classes

def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box=True,
    format=None,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=False,
    dayfirst=False,
    yearfirst=False,
    exact=False,
):
    # (existing code here...)
    # ...

    if tz is not None and not isinstance(arg, (np_classes, DatetimeIndex, DatetimeArray)):
        arg = DatetimeIndex(arg, name=name)

    result = arg if isinstance(arg, DatetimeIndex) else DatetimeIndex(arg)

    if tz is not None:
        result = result.tz_localize(tz).tz_convert("UTC")

    return result
``` 

In the corrected code, the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function has been modified to properly handle the time zone conversion. The result is now given by converting the `arg` object to a `DatetimeIndex` and then localizing and converting the time zone to UTC if `tz` is not None. This should fix the issue and make the function work correctly for both `DatetimeIndex` and `DatetimeArray` objects.
