The error occurs because the `to_datetime` function is not returning the expected results. The error message states that the `tz` attribute is different between the `DatetimeArray` objects. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the `tz_parsed` variable is handled.

The issue arises due to the mismanagement of time zones in the `tz_parsed` variable, which is causing discrepancies in the comparison between the expected and actual results.

To fix the bug, `tz_parsed` should be handled carefully to ensure proper time zone localization and conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    from pandas import DatetimeIndex
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
    from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import objects_to_datetime64ns

    if tz == "utc":
        zone = "UTC"
    else:
        zone = None

    result, tz_parsed = objects_to_datetime64ns(arg, dayfirst=dayfirst, yearfirst=yearfirst, utc=zone, errors=errors)

    if box:
        return DatetimeIndex(result, tz=tz, name=name)
    else:
        return result
```

By simplifying the code and ensuring that the time zones are managed correctly, we can address the issue where the incorrect time zones were causing the comparison failures.
