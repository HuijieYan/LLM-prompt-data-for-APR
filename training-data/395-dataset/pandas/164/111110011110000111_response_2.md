The test case is trying to convert the `obj` to datetime with `utc=True`, and then compares the result with an expected value. The error message suggests that the `tz` attribute is not being properly handled.

The potential error location in the function is in the part that deals with time zone localization and conversion.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling time zone localization and conversion when converting the input object to datetime with `utc=True`. This results in the `tz` attribute being different in the comparison.

To fix this bug, the function should ensure that time zone localization and conversion are handled properly when `utc` is set to `True`. It should also ensure that the `tz` attribute is consistent between the result and the expected value.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex

def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box=False,
    format=None,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    if tz is not None and len(arg) > 0:
        arg = DatetimeIndex(arg, tz=tz, name=name)
        return arg
    else:
        result = DatetimeIndex(arg, name=name)
        return result
```

This corrected function properly handles time zone localization and conversion. It creates a `DatetimeIndex` from the input `arg` with the specified time zone `tz` and returns it as the result. Furthermore, it sets the `name` attribute as specified. This should fix the bug and ensure that the test case passes without errors.
