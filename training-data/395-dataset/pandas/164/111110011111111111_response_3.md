The error is related to the incorrect behavior of the `to_datetime` function, leading to assertions failing in the test case. The test case involves creating a `DatetimeIndex` or `DatetimeArray` object, applying the `to_datetime` function with the `utc` parameter set to True, and then comparing the result with the expected object.

The potential error location within the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function is likely associated with the processing of datetime objects and their time zone conversions. The error messages suggest that there are discrepancies in the time zone attributes of the objects, indicating that the time zone localization and conversion are not being handled correctly.

The bug is occurring because the `to_datetime` function is not properly performing the time zone localization and conversion for the input datetime objects. As a result, when comparing the result with the expected object, the time zone attributes are found to be different.

To fix the bug, the `to_datetime` function should be modified to correctly handle time zone localization and conversion for the input datetime objects, ensuring that the result matches the expected object in terms of time zone attributes.

The corrected code for the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function is provided below:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp

def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Corrected implementation of the helper function for to_datetime. 
    Performs the conversions of 1D listlike of dates
    """

    # Existing code...

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(arg):
        if not isinstance(arg, DatetimeIndex):
            return DatetimeIndex(arg, tz=tz, name=name).tz_convert(tz)
        else:
            return arg.tz_convert(tz)

    elif is_datetime64_ns_dtype(arg):
        if box:
            try:
                return DatetimeIndex(arg, tz=tz, name=name).tz_convert(tz)
            except ValueError:
                pass
            return arg

    # Existing code...

    return arg
```

This corrected code handles the time zone localization and conversion of the input datetime objects properly, ensuring that the attributes of the result match the expected object.
