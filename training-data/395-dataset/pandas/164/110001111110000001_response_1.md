The error message indicates that the 'tz' attribute of the DatetimeArray is different from what is expected. This means that the function `_convert_listlike_datetimes` is not handling the time zone conversion properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the time zone handling and conversion is being performed.

The bug is occurring because the time zone conversion is not being handled correctly within the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function. The handling of time zones for both DateTimeIndex and DatetimeArray needs to be adjusted.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to revise the time zone conversion logic within the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function. Ensure that the time zone information is properly preserved or converted as required when creating the DateTimeIndex or DatetimeArray.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    if format is not None:
        # Check for time zone and apply correctly
        if tz == "utc":
            result = pd.to_datetime(arg, utc=True)
        else:
            result = pd.to_datetime(arg)

        if box:
            return pd.DatetimeIndex(result, name=name)
        else:
            return result
```

In this corrected code, the time zone conversion is properly handled using the `pd.to_datetime` function, which automatically takes care of time zone conversion. The returned result is then wrapped in a `DatetimeIndex` if `box` is true, otherwise, the result is returned as it is.
