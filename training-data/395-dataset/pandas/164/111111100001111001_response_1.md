The bug in the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function is likely related to the line:
```python
return DatetimeIndex._simple_new(result, name=name, tz=tz_parsed)
```
This line expects `result` to be a valid input to `DatetimeIndex._simple_new(...)` (which creates a DatetimeIndex object), but it is handled as a numpy array of Timestamps.

The bug may occur because the code tries to convert the `result` object to an ndarray of Timestamps if `box` is set to `False`. However, if `box` is set to `True`, it returns an Index-like object. It seems that the logic for handling `box` is not properly implemented.

A possible approach for fixing the bug could be to separate the logic for handling `box` into distinct branches, ensuring that the `result` object is correctly converted to either an Index-like object or an ndarray of Timestamps based on the `box` parameter.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as in the original code)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray of parsed dates
        Returns:

        - Index-like if box=True
        - ndarray of Timestamps if box=False
    """
    # existing code...
    
    if box:
        if errors == "ignore":
            from pandas import Index
            result = Index(result, name=name)
        else:
            result = DatetimeIndex(result, name=name)
        # Handle timezone localization
        if tz is not None:
            result = result.tz_localize(tz)
    else:
        # Convert result to ndarray of Timestamps
        result = np.array(result, dtype='datetime64[ns]')
    
    return result
```
In the corrected code, I separated the logic for handling the `box` parameter. If `box` is `True`, the result is converted to an Index-like object. If `box` is `False`, the result is converted to an ndarray of Timestamps. This approach ensures that the `result` object is correctly handled based on the `box` parameter.
