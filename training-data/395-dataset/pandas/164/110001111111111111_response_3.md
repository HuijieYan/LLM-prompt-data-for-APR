The error occurs when the `to_datetime` function is called with a `DatetimeArray` as the input parameter. The error message indicates that the `tz` attribute of the `DatetimeArray` is not being handled correctly.

On analyzing the code, it seems that the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function does not properly handle situations where the input is a `DatetimeArray`. This function has a nested set of conditional statements to handle different data types and unit conversions, but it does not seem to have specific handling for `DatetimeArray`.

One possible reason for the bug is that the method `_convert_listlike_datetimes` does not handle `DatetimeArray` instances. As a result, the correct conversion and timezone handling are not occurring, leading to the assertion error in the test.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function needs to be modified to handle the `DatetimeArray` type along with its timezone information. This would involve adding a specific conditional branch within the function to handle the `DatetimeArray` instances and ensure that the timezone-related operations are correctly applied.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=False,
    yearfirst=False,
    exact=False,
):
    if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")

    # handling DatetimeArray instances
    if isinstance(arg, DatetimeArray):
        if tz == "utc":
            arg = arg.tz_localize(tz)
        if box:
            return DatetimeIndex._simple_new(arg, name=name, tz=arg.tz)
        else:
            return arg

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, a new conditional branch is added to specifically handle `DatetimeArray` instances. This branch applies the timezone handling and returns the converted data accordingly. This should address the bug and allow the `to_datetime` function to work correctly with `DatetimeArray` instances.
