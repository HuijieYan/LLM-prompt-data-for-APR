The potential error location within the problematic function is towards the end, where the function is checking for `tz_parsed`.

The bug is likely caused by the function trying to access the `tz_parsed` variable outside the scope in which it was defined. This can happen if the if-else conditions nested within each other are not properly handled, resulting in the `tz_parsed` variable not being available when it is accessed later in the function.

To fix the bug, the function should be restructured to ensure that all variables are properly initialized within the correct scopes and that they are accessible when needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """
    # (existing code up to the point where tz_parsed is first used)

    if result is None:
        assert format is None or infer_datetime_format
        utc = tz == "utc"
        result, tz_parsed = objects_to_datetime64ns(
            arg,
            dayfirst=dayfirst,
            yearfirst=yearfirst,
            utc=utc,
            errors=errors,
            require_iso8601=require_iso8601,
            allow_object=True,
        )

        if tz_parsed is not None:
            if box:
                # We can take a shortcut since the datetime64 numpy array
                # is in UTC
                return DatetimeIndex._simple_new(result, name=name, tz=tz_parsed)
            else:
                # Convert the datetime64 numpy array to an numpy array
                # of datetime objects
                result = [
                    Timestamp(ts, tz=tz_parsed).to_pydatetime() for ts in result
                ]
                return np.array(result, dtype=object)

    if box:
        utc = tz == "utc"
        return _box_as_indexlike(result, utc=utc, name=name)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `tz_parsed` variable is initialized within the same scope in which it is used, ensuring that it is accessible throughout the function. Additionally, the structure of the if-else conditions has been adjusted to ensure that all necessary variables are properly handled.
