The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section of the code where it handles the arg parameter. The code tries to parse the arg parameter in different ways depending on its type and properties. However, the logic seems to be convoluted, leading to potential errors.

The bug occurs because the function tries to convert the arg parameter in multiple ways, and the flow of the logic might not lead to the expected outcomes. Additionally, the function contains complex conditional statements which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be refactored such that the logic for parsing the arg parameter is simplified and made more explicit. By restructuring the conditional statements and ensuring that the flow of the code is clear, the function's behavior can be improved.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import DatetimeIndex

def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format=None,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=False,
    dayfirst=False,
    yearfirst=False,
    exact=True
):
    if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")

    if isinstance(arg, DatetimeIndex):
        return arg.tz_convert(tz).tz_localize(tz) if tz == "utc" else arg.tz_convert(None).tz_localize(tz)

    elif isinstance(arg, np.ndarray) and np.issubdtype(arg.dtype, np.datetime64):
        if box:
            return DatetimeIndex(arg, tz=tz, name=name)
        else:
            return arg

    elif unit is not None:
        arg = np.asarray(arg)
        if format is not None:
            raise ValueError("cannot specify both format and unit")

        result, _ = tslib.array_with_unit_to_datetime(arg, unit, errors=errors)
        if box:
            if errors == "ignore":
                from pandas import Index
                result = Index(result, name=name)
            else:
                result = DatetimeIndex(result, name=name)

            if tz is not None:
                result = (result.tz_localize("UTC").tz_convert(tz) if tz == "utc" else result)
                
        return result

    elif len(arg.shape) > 1:
        raise TypeError("arg must be a string, datetime, list, tuple, 1-d array, or Series")

    else:
        return arg

```

In the corrected code:
1. The conditional statements are simplified to ensure a more straightforward flow of logic.
2. The complex conditional checks for data types have been replaced with more readable and explicit checks.
3. Redundant checks and conversions have been removed to improve the clarity and efficiency of the code.
