Potential error location:
The potential error location in the provided function is within the try-except block where various operations are performed on the 'result' variable. There are multiple try-except blocks, making it difficult to identify the specific error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the complexity and lack of clarity within the try-except blocks. This makes it challenging to identify and handle specific exceptions, leading to incorrect behavior of the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Refactor the code to have clear and specific try-except blocks for different operations.
2. Implement proper error handling and logging to identify the exact nature of errors during execution.
3. Utilize helper functions or methods to encapsulate specific operations, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format=None,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    Parameters
    ----------

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray of parsed dates
        Returns:

        - Index-like if box=True
