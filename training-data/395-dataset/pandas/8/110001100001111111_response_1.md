Based on the input and expected output, it appears that the issue is occurring in the `replace` method of the `pandas` library. The problem is that when calling `df.replace` with `pd.NA`, the dtype of the columns changes to object dtype when it should remain as float64.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the part where the values are being replaced with `pd.NA`. This could be causing a change in the dtype of the columns.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the handling of the special value `pd.NA` in the `replace` method. It seems that the implementation of `replace` is not handling `pd.NA` as expected, causing the dtype change.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the implementation of the `replace` method to correctly handle the special value `pd.NA` without changing the dtype of the columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `replace` method:

```python
def replace(self, to_replace, value, inplace=False, regex=False, convert=True):
    """
    Replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new blocks.
    This is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is used in ObjectBlocks.  It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    if pd.api.types.is_list_like(to_replace) and not pd.api.types.is_list_like(value):
        value = [value] * len(to_replace)

    if not pd.api.types.is_list_like(to_replace) and not pd.api.types.is_list_like(value):
        to_replace, value = [to_replace], [value]

    replace_dict = dict(zip(to_replace, value))

    if pd.NA in replace_dict:
        replace_dict[pd.NA] = pd.NA

    return self.replace(to_replace=replace_dict, inplace=inplace, regex=regex, convert=convert)
```

By explicitly handling the special value `pd.NA` in the `replace` method, this corrected code should prevent the dtype change issue when using `pd.NA` as the replacement value.
