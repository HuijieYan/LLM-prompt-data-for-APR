The issue seems to be occurring when the `replace` function is called with `pd.NA` as the value to replace with. This is causing the columns to be cast to object dtype.

The bug seems to be in the section where it checks if the given value to replace can be held by the current block. If not, it tries to cast the block to an object and then retry the `replace` operation. This logic is causing the columns to be cast to object dtype when replacing with `pd.NA`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `replace` function to handle the case when the value to replace with is `pd.NA` differently. We can skip the type conversion logic in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `replace` function:

```python
def replace(
    self,
    to_replace,
    value,
    inplace: bool = False,
    regex: bool = False,
    convert: bool = True,
):
    """
    replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new
    blocks here this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is used in ObjectBlocks.  It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    original_to_replace = to_replace

    if value is pd.NA:
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        new_blocks = [self.copy() for _ in range(len(to_replace))]
        return new_blocks

    # rest of the function remains the same...
```

This modification will ensure that when the value to replace with is `pd.NA`, the columns will not be cast to object dtype, and the dtype will remain the same as before the replace operation.
