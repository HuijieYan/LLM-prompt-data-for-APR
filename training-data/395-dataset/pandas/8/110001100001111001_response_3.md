The provided code is a function for replacing values within a block of data. The function seems to have multiple issues, as evidenced by the repeating code and potentially incorrect logic.

Looking at the different test cases, particularly case 1 and case 2, one can observe that the `to_replace` list is being modified inside the function. The `to_replace` list is being filtered based on the `self._can_hold_element` method. If no elements in the list satisfy the condition inside the `if` block, the entire list is being replaced with an empty list. This does not seem like the intended behavior and might lead to unexpected results.

Additionally, there are multiple occurrences of similar code blocks and methods in the function, leading to potential confusion and duplication.

To fix the issues, the following steps can be taken:

1. Review the logic of modifying the `to_replace` list and ensure that the replacement logic preserves the original `to_replace` list while allowing for specific elements that meet the condition.

2. Remove the duplicated code blocks and methods to improve the readability and maintainability of the function.

3. Ensure that the input parameters are being handled correctly and consistently throughout the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def replace(self, to_replace, value, inplace=False, regex=False, convert=True):
    """
    Replace the to_replace value with value. This method filters the to_replace list based on the _can_hold_element condition.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    original_to_replace = to_replace

    if not self._can_hold_element(to_replace):  # If we cannot replace with own dtype, convert to ObjectBlock and retry
        to_replace = [x for x in to_replace if self._can_hold_element(x)]
        if not to_replace:  # If the filtered list is empty, revert to the original to_replace list
            to_replace = original_to_replace

    values = self.values
    if lib.is_scalar(to_replace) and isinstance(values, np.ndarray):
        to_replace = convert_scalar_for_putitemlike(to_replace, values.dtype)

    mask = missing.mask_missing(values, to_replace)

    if not mask.any():  # If there are no values to replace, return the original block
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        return [self.copy()]

    blocks = self.putmask(mask, value, inplace=inplace)

    if convert:
        blocks = [b.convert(numeric=False, copy=not inplace) for b in blocks]

    return blocks
```
