The issue seems to be with the `replace` function, which is unexpectedly casting columns to object dtype when using `pd.NA` or `np.nan` as the `value` parameter. This is observed when no actual values are being replaced, causing the dtype to change to object instead of remaining as float64. 

The potential error location within the `replace` function is likely in the section where the `mask` is being generated and then used to replace values in the `putmask` function. It seems that when `pd.NA` or `np.nan` is used as the `value`, it is causing the dtype conversion to object.

The bug likely occurs due to the function failing to handle the replacement with `pd.NA` or `np.nan` efficiently, which results in an unexpected dtype conversion to object.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the replacement with `pd.NA` or `np.nan` in a way that preserves the original dtype of the columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `replace` function:

```python
def replace(
    self,
    to_replace,
    value,
    inplace: bool = False,
    regex: bool = False,
    convert: bool = True,
):
    """
    replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new
    blocks here this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is used in ObjectBlocks.  It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    original_to_replace = to_replace

    if not self._can_hold_element(to_replace):
        if not isinstance(to_replace, list):
            if inplace:
                return [self]
            return [self.copy()]

        mask_applied = False
        if to_replace == pd.NA or to_replace == np.nan:
            # create a boolean mask for the condition
            mask = self.isin([to_replace])
            mask_applied = True
        else:
            to_replace = [x for x in to_replace if self._can_hold_element(x)]
            if not len(to_replace):
                # avoid costly checks since there is nothing to replace in this block
                if inplace:
                    return [self]
                return [self.copy()]

        if not mask_applied:
            if len(to_replace) != 1:
                return self.replace(
                    to_replace[0], value, inplace=inplace, regex=regex, convert=convert,
                )

        try:
            blocks = self.putmask(mask, value, inplace=inplace)
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            assert not self._can_hold_element(value), value
            block = self.astype(object)
            return block.replace(
                to_replace=original_to_replace,
                value=value,
                inplace=inplace,
                regex=regex,
                convert=convert,
            )
        
        if convert:
            blocks = [b.convert(numeric=False, copy=not inplace) for b in blocks]
        return blocks
```

This corrected code includes a specific check for `pd.NA` or `np.nan` in the `to_replace` parameter and creates a boolean mask to handle the replacement in a way that preserves the original dtype of the columns.
