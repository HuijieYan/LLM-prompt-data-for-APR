The bug seems to be occurring when the `replace` function is called with `pd.NA` as the `value` parameter and a list containing `[None, -np.inf, np.inf]` as the `to_replace` parameter. This is causing the columns to be cast to `object` dtype instead of maintaining their original `float64` dtype.

The issue seems to stem from the conditional checks and data type conversions within the `replace` function. It appears that when `to_replace` contains special values like `np.inf`, `-np.inf`, and `None`, the function is not handling them correctly, leading to the unexpected casting of column dtypes.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks within the `replace` function should be revised to properly handle special values such as `np.inf`, `-np.inf`, and `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `replace` function:

```python
def replace(self, to_replace, value, inplace: bool = False, regex: bool = False, convert: bool = True):
    if isinstance(value, pd.NA):
        # No actual replacement is performed, so no need to change column types
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        return [self.copy()]
    
    # Rest of the code for the replace function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, when `value` is `pd.NA`, the function will not perform any replacement and will return the original DataFrame without changing the column types.

This should address the issue of columns being cast to `object` dtype when using `pd.NA` with a `to_replace` list containing special values.
