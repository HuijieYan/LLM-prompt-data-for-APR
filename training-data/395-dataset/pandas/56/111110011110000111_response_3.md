The error message is indicating that the `DataFrame._get_value` method is returning a `Timestamp` object instead of a `datetime` object, which is causing an assertion error in the test function.

The potential error location is within the `DataFrame._get_value` method, specifically where `maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])` is called. This suggests that the problem lies in the handling of datetime objects within the `DataFrame._get_value` method.

The bug occurs because the `DataFrame._get_value` method is not correctly handling the conversion of datetime objects. It should return a `datetime` object, but it is returning a `Timestamp` object instead.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `DataFrame._get_value` method correctly handles the conversion of datetime objects and returns a `datetime` object instead of a `Timestamp` object.

Here's the corrected `DataFrame._get_value` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index]

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    return series._values[index]
```

In the corrected `DataFrame._get_value` method, the unnecessary handling and conversion of datetime objects have been removed. This should ensure that the method returns the correct datatype and resolves the bug.
