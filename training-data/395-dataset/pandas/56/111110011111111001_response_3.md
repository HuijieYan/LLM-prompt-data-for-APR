The test case `test_iat_dont_wrap_object_datetimelike` is checking the behavior of the `.iat` method, which calls `DataFrame._get_value`. It is expected that this method should not call `maybe_box_datetimelike` for object dtype Series.

The error message indicates that the assertion `result is ser[0]` failed. This means that the result obtained from the execution of the DataFrame methods (`at`, `iat`, `loc`, `iloc`) is not the same as the expected value obtained from the `ser` Series.

The potential error location is identified as the `_get_value` method in the `DataFrame` class. The function is not handling datetime and timedelta objects correctly and is returning unexpected values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_get_value` method is not correctly retrieving the single value at the passed column and index when dealing with datetime and timedelta object types.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `_get_value` method to handle datetime and timedelta objects properly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_value` method:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False
    
    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index]

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)

    if is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(series):
        return series._values[index]
    else:
        engine = self.index._engine
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
```

In the corrected code, after checking if the `takeable` flag is set, we directly return the value from the series if it is a datetime or timedelta dtype. Otherwise, we proceed to retrieve the value using the engine. This approach ensures that datetime and timedelta objects are handled appropriately without calling `maybe_box_datetimelike`.
