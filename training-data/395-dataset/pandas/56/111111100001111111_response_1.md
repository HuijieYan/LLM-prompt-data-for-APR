The buggy function `_get_value` is trying to retrieve a single value from a DataFrame at the given index and column. The function uses the instance's methods `_iget_item_cache` and `_get_item_cache` to get the series for the given column. Then, it tries to perform operations based on whether `takeable` is True or False.

The bug occurs when `takeable` is True and the function tries to handle direct indexing. The function should not call itself with `takeable=True` in this scenario, leading to a potential infinite loop.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to handle direct indexing correctly without calling itself again.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_value` function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    if isinstance(index, int):
        return series._values[index]
    else:
        loc = series.index.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
```

In the corrected code, we first check if direct indexing is needed (when `takeable` is True). If so, we handle it without calling the function recursively, eliminating the potential for an infinite loop. If direct indexing is not needed, we handle it using the proper pandas methods for getting the location of the index within the series.
