The bug is in the _get_value method, specifically in the part where it tries to take a value from the series based on the provided index. The bug seems to be related to the use of the "engine" variable and its get_loc method.

In the buggy function, when takeable is False, the function should be calling self._get_item_cache(col) to retrieve the series. Afterward, it should use the series' _values attribute to retrieve the value at the specified index. However, the line of code that uses engine.get_loc(index) is introducing some complexity that doesn't seem necessary and is likely causing the bug.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to remove the unnecessary use of the engine and its get_loc method. The bug can be fixed by directly using the series and its _values attribute to get the value at the specified index.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_value method:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    return series._values[index]
```
