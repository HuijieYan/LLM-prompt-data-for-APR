The bug occurs because the `_get_value` function should not handle object types, such as datetime, in the same way as it does for other types. This leads to the assertion error in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_value` function to handle object types, such as datetime, differently and not call `com.maybe_box_datetimelike` for these types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_value` function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    series = self._iget_item_cache(col) if takeable else self._get_item_cache(col)
    if isinstance(series, pd.Series) and np.issubdtype(series.dtype, np.datetime64):
        return series._values[index]
    else:
        return series[index]
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the series is of type DateTime and handle it accordingly. If it is not a DateTime type, the normal index operation is performed to retrieve the value. This will prevent the inappropriate handling of DateTime values which caused the assertion error.
