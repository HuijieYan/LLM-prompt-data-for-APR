Potential error location:
The error might be occurring in the recursive call to `_get_value` at the end of the function. It seems like the intention is to handle the case where direct indexing is not possible, but the recursive call does not seem to be correctly implemented.

Reason for the bug:
The recursive call to `_get_value` at the end of the function does not seem to handle the case where direct indexing is not possible properly. It seems to be using the same `takeable` argument without modifying it, which will result in an infinite recursive call.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the recursive call to `_get_value` by setting the `takeable` argument to `True` to ensure that we are following the correct path for indirect indexing.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
    except KeyError:
        # GH 20629
        if self.index.nlevels > 1:
            # partial indexing forbidden
            raise

    # we cannot handle direct indexing
    # use positional
    col = self.columns.get_loc(col)
    index = self.index.get_loc(index)
    return self._get_value(index, col, takeable=True)  # Modified the recursive call to set takeable to True
```
By setting the `takeable` argument to `True` in the recursive call, we ensure that we are following the correct path for indirect indexing and avoid an infinite recursive call.
