The test case is checking whether the result from different ways of indexing (e.g., `at`, `iat`, `loc`, `iloc`) are the same as the expected result. The error message indicates that the result obtained from `df.iat[0, 0]` is not as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_get_value` method, specifically in the `if takeable` condition where `com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])` is called. This condition is likely causing the incorrect type conversion.

The error occurs because the `maybe_box_datetimelike` function is incorrectly handling the `datetime.datetime` and `Timestamp` types, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the `if takeable` condition to properly handle the type conversions and return the correct value.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve a single value at the passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    series = self._iget_item_cache(col) if takeable else self._get_item_cache(col)
    
    if takeable:
        return series._values[index]
    else:
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])
```

The changes made include extracting the common part of the logic (`series = self._iget_item_cache(col) if takeable else self._get_item_cache(col)`) outside of the `if takeable` condition, and returning the appropriate value based on `takeable`. This should ensure that the conversion is handled correctly and that the correct value is returned based on the `takeable` flag.
