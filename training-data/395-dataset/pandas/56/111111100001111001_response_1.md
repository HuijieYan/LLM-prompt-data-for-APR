The buggy function `_get_value` is designed to quickly retrieve a single value at a given column and index. It takes into account the `takeable` parameter, which determines if the index and column should be interpreted as indexers.

The bug is likely related to the conditional statements in the function. When `takeable` is `True`, the function tries to retrieve the value from the dataset and if it fails, it falls back to using direct indexing rather than positional indexing, which leads to a recursive call to the same function with `takeable=True`, creating an infinite loop.

One approach to fixing this bug is to change the logic for handling `takeable` to prevent the infinite recursion. Additionally, the logic for using direct indexing might need to be revisited to provide the correct fallback mechanism.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_value` function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])
    else:
        series = self._get_item_cache(col)
        engine = self.index._engine

        try:
            loc = engine.get_loc(index)
            return series._values[loc]
        except KeyError:
            if self.index.nlevels > 1:
                raise  # partial indexing forbidden

        # use positional
        col_loc = self.columns.get_loc(col)
        index_loc = index

        return series._values[index_loc]
```

In this corrected code, we removed the recursive call and added logic to handle positional indexing when `takeable` is `False`. We also took into account the behavior of the `get_loc` function and adjusted the index and column variables accordingly.
