The error message indicates that the 'freq' parameter is None when calling the 'to_period' method, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'n' attribute of the NoneType object.

The error is likely occurring in the 'to_period' method of the DatetimeArray class where the 'freq' parameter is set to None. This causes the subsequent code to raise an AttributeError when it tries to access the 'n' attribute of the 'freq' variable, assuming it to be a period-like object.

To fix this issue, the 'to_period' method should handle the case when 'freq' is None and provide a default value for 'freq'. This can be done by checking if 'freq' is None and assigning a default frequency if it is. Additionally, if 'freq' is still None after this check, an appropriate ValueError should be raised to inform the user that a frequency couldn't be inferred.

Here's the corrected code for the 'to_period' method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In this corrected code, if 'freq' is None, it defaults to 'self.freqstr' or 'self.inferred_freq' if available. If 'freq' is still None after these checks, a ValueError is raised as per the specified behavior.
