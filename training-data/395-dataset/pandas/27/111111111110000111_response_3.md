The test case `test_to_period_infer` is trying to convert a date range to a PeriodIndex without specifying a frequency. This should work according to the documentation, which states that if the frequency is not provided, it will be inferred. However, the error message indicates that there is an issue with inferring the frequency.

The potential error location within the `to_period` function is likely in the following block of code:

```python
if freq is None:
    freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

    if freq is None:
        raise ValueError(
            "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
        )

    freq = get_period_alias(freq)
```

The error is occurring because the inferred frequency is returning `None` and then being used in the `get_period_alias` function, which is causing the AttributeError in the `_maybe_convert_freq` function.

To fix this bug, the `inferred_freq` attribute needs to be correctly set before attempting to use it in the `to_period` method.

The corrected code for the `to_period` function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also

    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({"y": [1, 2, 3]},

                dtype='period[M]', freq='M')
    """

    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr
        if freq is None:
            inferred_freq = infer_freq(self._data)
            if inferred_freq is None:
                raise ValueError(
                    "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
                )
            freq = get_period_alias(inferred_freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, we have added a call to `infer_freq` to correctly infer the frequency if it is not explicitly provided. The `freqstr` is only considered if `freq` is not specified and `freqstr` is not None. This should resolve the issue of inferring the frequency and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
