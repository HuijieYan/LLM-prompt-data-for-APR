The error is occurring in the `to_period` function of the `DatetimeArray` class. The error message indicates that the `freq` parameter is not being handled correctly, causing an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'n' attribute of the `freq` object.

Based on the code and the input provided, it seems that the `freq` parameter is not being handled properly when it is not explicitly provided.

To fix this bug, the `to_period` function should properly handle cases where the `freq` parameter is not explicitly provided. It should infer the frequency from the data or raise an error if it cannot infer the frequency.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray, datetimelike_to_period

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        try:
            freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq
            freq = get_period_alias(freq)
        except AttributeError:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has none."
            )

    return datetimelike_to_period(self, freq)
```

This corrected code handles the case where the `freq` parameter is not explicitly provided and infers the frequency from the data. If it cannot infer the frequency, it raises a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

By making these changes, the `to_period` function should work correctly in both cases where the `freq` parameter is explicitly provided and where it needs to be inferred.
