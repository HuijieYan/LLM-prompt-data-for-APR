The error occurs when calling `rng.to_period()` without specifying a frequency, which is expected to be inferred from the datetime index. The bug is likely in the `to_period` method of the `DatetimeArray` class, specifically in the conditional block where the frequency is inferred from the index if not provided.

The bug occurs because the frequency is not being correctly inferred, leading to a `NoneType` object without the attribute 'n', which causes the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency is correctly inferred when not provided and that it is a valid frequency for the conversion to a `PeriodArray/Index`.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays.period import Period, dt64arr_to_periodarr

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        inferred_freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq
        if inferred_freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has none."
            )
        freq, _, _ = Period._maybe_convert_freq(inferred_freq)

    data = self._data
    result = dt64arr_to_periodarr(data, freq, self.tz)

    if isinstance(self._data, ABCDatetimeArray):
        result.freq = freq

    return result
```

In this correction, we handle the case when no frequency is provided, infer the frequency if possible from the `freqstr` or `inferred_freq`, and then convert the datetime array to the period array using the inferred frequency. This should fix the AttributeError issue encountered in the original buggy function.
