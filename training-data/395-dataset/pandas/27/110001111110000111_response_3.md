1. The test case creates a date range with a frequency of 5 minutes and then attempts to convert it to a PeriodIndex without specifying a frequency. This triggers the bug.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the 'freq' argument when it is not specified. The function attempts to infer the frequency when 'freq' is None, but this logic is causing the AttributeError.

3. The bug occurs because the function attempts to access the 'n' attribute of the 'freq' object without first checking if 'freq' is not None. This leads to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'n'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking if the 'freq' object is not None before accessing its attributes.
   - Handling the case when 'freq' is None separately to ensure that appropriate actions are taken.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )
        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    else:
        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```
In the corrected code, the 'freq' object is checked for None before any attribute is accessed. Additionally, the 'freq' is then converted using the 'get_period_alias' function to ensure compatibility.
