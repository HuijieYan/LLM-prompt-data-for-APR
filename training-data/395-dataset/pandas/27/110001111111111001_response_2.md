The error occurs in the `to_period` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. It seems that the `freq` parameter is not being handled correctly. The error message indicates that the `NoneType` object has no attribute 'n', which means that the `freq` variable is None at some point during the execution, and the code is trying to access the 'n' attribute of a `None` object.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `freq` parameter. When freq is not provided, the code attempts to infer it from other attributes such as `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq`. However, if none of these attributes provide a valid frequency, the code does not handle this case properly, leading to None being passed to `Period._maybe_convert_freq`, which causes the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to add proper handling for the case when the frequency cannot be inferred. It would be best to check if `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq` is None, and if both are None, raise a ValueError indicating that a frequency could not be inferred.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```
In this corrected code, if `self.freqstr` and `self.inferred_freq` are both None, a ValueError will be raised, indicating that a frequency could not be inferred. This fix should prevent the AttributeError that was occurring due to passing None to `Period._maybe_convert_freq`.
