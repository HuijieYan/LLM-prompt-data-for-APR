The issue seems to be related to the `freq` parameter not being inferred correctly when calling the `to_period` method without providing a frequency. The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'n'" indicates that the frequency is not being inferred properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the following block of code:
```python
if freq is None:
    freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

    if freq is None:
        raise ValueError(
            "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
        )

    freq = get_period_alias(freq)
```
The bug occurs when no `freq` argument is passed and the `freq` is not being inferred correctly, leading to a `NoneType` object being used as a frequency.

To fix this bug, the function should properly infer the frequency if `freq` is not provided, and then use that frequency to create the PeriodIndex. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.

    Examples
    --------
    (same examples as before...)
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.inferred_freq
    
        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```
In the corrected function, I removed the use of `freqstr` as it was redundant and could potentially cause issues with inferring the frequency. I also removed the call to `get_period_alias(freq)` as it is not necessary.

With these changes, the function should now correctly infer the frequency if `freq` is not provided and create the PeriodIndex accordingly.
