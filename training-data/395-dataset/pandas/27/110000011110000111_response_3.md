1. The test functions create a date range with a frequency of 5 minutes and then attempt to convert it to a PeriodIndex using the `to_period` method without specifying a frequency.

2. The potential error is likely within the `to_period` method of the `DatetimeIndex` or `Datetimelike` object. The error occurs when the frequency (`freq`) is not provided, and it attempts to infer it.

3. The error occurs because when the frequency is not provided explicitly, the `freq` variable ends up being `None`, and the code attempts to access the attribute `n` of `freq`, which results in the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'n'`.

4. One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if the `freq` is `None` before trying to access its attribute `n`. If it is `None`, the code can handle this case appropriately, such as by inferring the frequency or raising an error if no frequency can be inferred.

5. The corrected code for the `to_period` method is as follows:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray
    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    inferred_freq = self.freqstr or getattr(self, "inferred_freq", None)
    if freq is None:
        freq = inferred_freq
        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )
        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    if freq.n is None or freq.n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid frequency: {}".format(freq))

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `freq` is `None`. If it is, we use the `inferred_freq` and raise an error if it is still `None`. Then, we ensure that `freq.n` is not `None` and is greater than 0 before proceeding with the conversion to a `PeriodArray/Index`. This should handle the issue of `NoneType` object error when inferring the frequency.
