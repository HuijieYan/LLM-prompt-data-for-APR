The error is occurring in the `to_period` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. The bug appears to be in the line `if freq.n <= 0:`, which is trying to access the `n` attribute of the `freq` variable. However, in some cases, `freq` is `None`, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `freq` is not None before accessing its `n` attribute. If `freq` is None, we can set a default value for `n`.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    if freq is not None and freq.n is not None and freq.n <= 0:
        freq.n = 1  # Set a default value for n if freq.n is None or <= 0

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

With this correction, the `to_period` method should handle the case when `freq` is `None` and avoid the AttributeError. This change ensures that a default value is set for `n` if it's not already defined.
