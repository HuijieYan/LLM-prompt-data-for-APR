Potential error location: The error is most likely occurring in the `dt64arr_to_periodarr` function, specifically in the line `if freq.n <= 0`. The error message indicates that `freq` is of type `NoneType`, which means that `freq` is not being properly initialized.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The bug is happening because the `freq` variable is not being properly handled in all code paths. When `freq` is not provided as an argument, it is being inferred from other attributes, and if it cannot be inferred, it should raise a ValueError. However, in some situations, `freq` is being set to None without raising the ValueError, leading to the erroneous behavior.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug:

1. Check if `freq` is None and raise a ValueError if it cannot be inferred from other attributes. This way, any missing frequency information will be properly handled.
2. Ensure that the preceding code that assigns a value to `freq` sets it to a valid frequency object, or handle the case where it is None appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.
