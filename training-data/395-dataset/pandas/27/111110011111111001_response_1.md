The error message indicates that the `freq` parameter in the `to_period` function is evaluated as `None` when it should not be. This means that the frequency is not being inferred correctly, leading to the AttributeError.

The bug is in the inference of the frequency, particularly in the conditional statement checking the `freq` variable. The current code allows `freq` to be `None` even though it should be inferred as '5T'. This causes issues in the subsequent code where it tries to access attributes of `freq` which fails because `freq` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the frequency inference logic and ensure that the `freq` parameter is correctly initialized based on the input and available instance attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray
    from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        inferred_freq = self.freq or self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if inferred_freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has none."
            )

        freq = to_offset(inferred_freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, we first check whether `freq` is `None`, and if so, we use the `freq`, `freqstr`, and `inferred_freq` attributes of the instance to infer the frequency. We then use `to_offset` to get the appropriate offset object. This ensures that the `freq` parameter is set to a valid value based on available information.
