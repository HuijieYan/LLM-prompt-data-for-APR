The issue seems to be happening when the `freq` parameter is not provided and it's trying to infer the frequency. There could be an issue in inferring the frequency from the `DatetimeArray/Index`. The bug might be located in the section where it tries to infer the frequency from the input data.

To fix the bug, you can modify the code to handle the case where the `freq` parameter is not provided. You can use the `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq` as the frequency and if both are `None`, then raise a ValueError. It seems that the current code does not handle the case where the frequency cannot be inferred from the input data.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.

    Examples
    --------
    (same examples as before...)

    """

    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

    freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

With this fix, the code checks if `freq` is None, then it tries to use `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq` as the frequency. If both are `None`, then it raises a ValueError.

This should resolve the bug and allow the `to_period` method to work as expected, both when the `freq` parameter is provided and when it's not.
