The error in the code is occurring likely because the `tz` attribute is being accessed as if it were a method, which may cause unexpected behavior. The name `tz` is used for both a property and a method in the `DatetimeArray` class. This results in ambiguity and unexpected behavior.

To fix this, the `tz` method should be renamed to avoid the conflict with the `tz` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `DatetimeArray` class:

```python
class DatetimeArray(dtl.DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, dtl.TimelikeOps, dtl.DatelikeOps):
    """
    Pandas ExtensionArray for tz-naive or tz-aware datetime data.
    ...
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def tz_method(self):
        # Implementation of the method
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def to_period(self, freq=None):
        """
        Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.
        ...
        """
        from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

        if self.tz is not None:
            warnings.warn(
                "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
                "will drop timezone information.",
                UserWarning,
            )

        if freq is None:
            freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

            if freq is None:
                raise ValueError(
                    "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has none."
                )

            freq = get_period_alias(freq)

        return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In this corrected code, the `tz` method was renamed to `tz_method` to avoid the conflict with the `tz` attribute. This should resolve the ambiguity and potential issues in the original code.
