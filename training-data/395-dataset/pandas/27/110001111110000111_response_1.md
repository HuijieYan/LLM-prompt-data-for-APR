The error occurs in the `to_period` method of the `DatetimeIndex` class when the `freq` parameter is not provided. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'n', which suggests that the `freq` variable is None and it's trying to access the 'n' attribute on a None object.

The issue arises because the code does not handle the case when `freq` is not provided properly. It attempts to use the `freq` variable without verifying if it is None.

To fix the bug, we should handle the case when `freq` is None by inferring the frequency from the index itself. We can also update the code to properly handle the `freq` parameter and avoid accessing attributes on None objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.

    Examples
    --------
    ... # (remaining docstring remains the same)

    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        inferred_freq = self.freq or self.inferred_freq
        if inferred_freq is None:
            raise ValueError("You must pass a freq argument as current index has none.")
        freq = get_period_alias(inferred_freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the case when `freq` is None and use the `inferred_freq` from the index to determine the frequency. Then we proceed to create the `PeriodArray` using the inferred or specified frequency. This should resolve the AttributeError issue when `freq` is None.
