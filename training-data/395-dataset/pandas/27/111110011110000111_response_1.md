The error occurs when the `to_period` method is called without a specific frequency. The error message indicates that the frequency (`freq`) is a `NoneType` object, which causes an attribute error when the code tries to access the attribute `n`.

This issue occurs because the code does not handle the case when `freq` is not provided correctly. When `freq` is not provided, it should be inferred from the data. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `to_period` method to handle the case when `freq` is not provided. We can use the existing logic to infer the frequency when `freq` is not provided and then proceed with the conversion to `PeriodArray`.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetimes(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

This corrected code will handle the case when `freq` is not provided by inferring it from the data and then proceeding with the conversion to `PeriodArray`.
