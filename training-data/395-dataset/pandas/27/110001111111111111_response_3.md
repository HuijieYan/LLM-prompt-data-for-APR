The error message indicates that the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'n', which suggests that the 'freq' variable is not being properly handled in the function.

Upon analyzing the buggy function and the test case, it seems that the 'freq' variable is not being handled correctly when it is not explicitly provided. The code is trying to access the attribute 'n' of the 'freq' variable without properly checking if 'freq' is None.

To fix this issue, the function needs to handle the case where 'freq' is not explicitly provided. It should properly infer the frequency if 'freq' is None, without causing attribute errors.

The corrected code for the problematic function 'to_period' is as follows:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    if freq is not None:  # Check if freq is not None
        return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Frequency could not be inferred.")
```

With this correction, the function properly checks if 'freq' is None and infers the frequency if it is not provided explicitly. This should resolve the attribute error caused by accessing the 'n' attribute of 'freq' when it is None.
