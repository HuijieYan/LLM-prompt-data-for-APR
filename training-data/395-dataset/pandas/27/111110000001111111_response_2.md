The buggy function `to_period` is responsible for converting a `DatetimeArray` to a `PeriodArray` at a particular frequency. The function first checks if the `tz` attribute of the `DatetimeArray` is not None and issues a warning. Then, it infers the frequency if not provided, and finally returns the `PeriodArray` using the inferred or provided frequency and `tz` attribute.

Based on the provided information, it seems that when `freq` is not provided, the function tries to infer the frequency using `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq`. However, in the buggy case, either of these attributes seems to be `None`, which leads to the ValueError being raised. Additionally, in the expected test case 1, `self.freqstr` is expected to be `'5T'` but in the buggy case 1, it contains the value `'5min'`. This discrepancy also indicates that the frequency inference might be incorrect.

The bug is likely happening due to incorrect frequency inference when `freq` is not provided, leading to the ValueError being raised.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to check whether `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq` is None, and if so, handle this case by either raising a ValueError with a meaningful error message or setting a default frequency. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the process of frequency inference to ensure that it works correctly in all scenarios.

Here is the corrected code for the `to_period` function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        if self.freqstr is None and self.inferred_freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has no inferred frequency."
            )

        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq
        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check whether `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq` is None when `freq` is not provided. If both are None, a ValueError is raised. Otherwise, the correct frequency is inferred and used to return the `PeriodArray`. This approach should address the bug and ensure proper frequency handling when converting `DatetimeArray` to `PeriodArray`.
