The test case `test_to_period_infer` creates a date range using the `pd.date_range` function with a specific start, end, and frequency. It then calls the `to_period` method on this date range, first with a specified frequency of '5min' and then without a specified frequency.

The error message indicates that the problem occurs when the `to_period` method is called without a specified frequency: `pi5m.to_period()`. The error is related to the frequency attribute; specifically, it seems that the `freq` parameter is being treated as a `NoneType` object and an attempt is made to access an attribute that does not exist.

The potential error location within the `to_period` method is identified in the following lines:

```python
if freq is None:
    freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

    if freq is None:
        raise ValueError(
            "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has none."
        )

    freq = get_period_alias(freq)
```

The issue is occurring because the code is trying to use an inferred frequency when `freq` is not provided, and this process is failing for some reason, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the default frequency handling works as expected. This could involve checking the logic for inferring the frequency when `freq` is not provided and handling the `freq` attribute appropriately.

The corrected code for the `to_period` method is as follows:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freq or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the default frequency when `freq` is not provided is adjusted to account for potential issues with inferring the frequency. Additionally, the checking and setting of the `freq` attribute are improved to ensure proper functionality.
