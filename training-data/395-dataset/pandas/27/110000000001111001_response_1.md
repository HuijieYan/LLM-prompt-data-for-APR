The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition where it tries to infer the frequency (freq) if it is not provided as an argument. This part of the code uses self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq to determine the frequency, and then it sets freq to the result of get_period_alias(freq). However, if the inferred_freq is not None, it should use that value for freq instead of reassigning it to get_period_alias(freq).

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The code is not handling the condition where self.inferred_freq is not None properly.
2. If freq is not provided, self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq should automatically set the frequency.

The potential approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check if self.inferred_freq is not None, then set freq to self.inferred_freq. Otherwise, continue with the original approach.
2. Remove the line freq = get_period_alias(freq) as it's unnecessary in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,

    if freq is None:
        if self.inferred_freq is not None:
            freq = self.inferred_freq
        elif self.freqstr is not None:
            freq = self.freqstr
        else:
