The bug is caused by the code trying to access the attribute `n` on the `freq` variable when `freq` is None. This occurs at the line `if freq.n <= 0:` within the `_from_datetime64` function.

The reason the bug occurs is that the code does not handle the case where `freq` might be None. This could be due to the frequency not being provided as an argument to the `to_period` function.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `freq` is None and handle this case appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `to_period` function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray
    
    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )
    
    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq
        
        # Check if freq is still None
        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )
        
        freq = get_period_alias(freq)
    # Add a check to handle the case where freq is None
    elif freq.n <= 0:
        raise ValueError(
            "Invalid frequency: must be a positive number of periods."
        )

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```
