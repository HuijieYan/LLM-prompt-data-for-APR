The error message indicates that the attribute 'n' is being accessed on a 'NoneType' object, which suggests that the 'freq' variable is None. This likely arises from the condition `if freq is None` present in the code.

The error occurs because the code does not handle the case where the `freq` parameter is None. This causes the subsequent code to fail when trying to access attribute 'n' on the None object.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case where the `freq` parameter is None. This can be achieved by adding a conditional check to set a default value for `freq` when it is None.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq
        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )
        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

With this change, the function will now handle the case where the `freq` parameter is None and set a default value based on `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq` if needed.
