The error is occurring because the `to_period` function is not handling the case when `freq` is not provided properly. It is supposed to infer the frequency if `freq` is not provided, but it is not doing so.

The bug is due to not handling the case when `freq` is not provided. The code should infer the frequency if `freq` is not provided.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `to_period` function to correctly infer the frequency when `freq` is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.

    Examples
    --------
    ... (examples remain the same)

    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:  # Check if freq is not provided
        freq = self.freq  # Infer frequency from the current index

        if freq is None:
            freq = 'D'  # Set default frequency (e.g., daily) if it cannot be inferred
    
    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to infer the frequency if `freq` is not provided. If the frequency cannot be inferred from the current index, we set a default frequency (e.g., daily). This should fix the bug and correctly handle the case when `freq` is not provided.
