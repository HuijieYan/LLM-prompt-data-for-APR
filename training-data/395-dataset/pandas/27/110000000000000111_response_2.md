The potential error location within the `to_period` function is the part where it tries to infer the frequency if `freq` is None:

```python
if freq is None:
    freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

    if freq is None:
        raise ValueError(
            "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
        )

    freq = get_period_alias(freq)
```

The bug occurs because the code is trying to infer the frequency but it is not handling the case where both `freqstr` and `inferred_freq` are None. This leads to the `NoneType` object error.

To fix this bug, we should modify the code to handle the case where both `freqstr` and `inferred_freq` are None, and provide a default frequency in such cases.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
