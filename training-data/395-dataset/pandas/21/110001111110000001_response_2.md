The test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` does not match any values in the index of the `ser` Series.

The error message is indicating that the test case failed because the `KeyError` exception was not raised, which means the code did not handle the invalid `key` properly.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is primarily focused on the handling of the key that does not match any values in the index of the Series. It seems that the code does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the failure of the test case with a missing `KeyError` exception.

The bug occurred because the `_get_with` function does not handle the case when the key is not found in the index, leading to the missing `KeyError` exception.

To fix the bug, proper handling of the case when the key is not found in the index should be added to the `_get_with` function. This would involve checking if the key exists in the index before attempting to access the corresponding value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
```
