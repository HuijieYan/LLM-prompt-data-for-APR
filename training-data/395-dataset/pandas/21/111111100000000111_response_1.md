The bug occurs when using a list as an indexer for a Pandas Series, which results in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. The error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" indicates that the index item 'C' from the list is not found in the Series' index.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is likely in the block of code where the list indexer is being handled. The issue arises from the handling of list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, the handling of list indexers should be made consistent with other array-like indexers to ensure uniform behavior. This may involve adjusting the logic for list indexers to match the behavior of other indexers, such as array-like or non-boolean indexers, ensuring that the index item is found in the Series' index before returning the result.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function would be as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of list indexers has been updated to ensure consistent behavior with other array-like indexers, resolving the bug.
