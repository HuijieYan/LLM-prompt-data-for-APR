The error occurs because the function `_get_with` treats list indexers differently from other types of indexers, such as array-like or Index indexers. This leads to inconsistent behavior, as shown in the test cases.

The possible error location is in the logic that handles the different types of indexers. The code currently does not handle the list indexers correctly, leading to the KeyError when accessing the Series with a list key.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list indexers in a similar manner to other types of indexers. This will ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers when accessing the Series.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert all types of indexers into a list
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    else:
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, all types of indexers will be converted into a list, ensuring consistent behavior and preventing the KeyError that occurred previously.
