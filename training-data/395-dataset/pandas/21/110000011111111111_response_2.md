The issue is likely related to the treatment of different types of indexers. Specifically, the bug occurs when a list indexer is used in the `ser[key]` expression, resulting in a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are handled.

The bug occurs because there is a discrepancy in how different types of indexers are treated in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is used, it fails to handle the case correctly and raises a KeyError, while other types of indexers (such as `np.array` or `pd.Index`) do not exhibit the same behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This may involve updating the logic for how different types of indexers are processed and ensuring that the behavior is consistent across all types.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should handle list indexers in a manner consistent with other array-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior is uniform regardless of the type of indexer used in the `ser[key]` expression.
