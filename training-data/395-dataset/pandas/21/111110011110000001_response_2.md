The provided test function is testing the `__getitem__` method by passing different box types (list, np array, pd Index, pd Series) as the input key and checking if it raises a KeyError with the specified message.

The error message indicates that the KeyError was not raised as expected when using a pd.Index as the box type.

The potential error in the problematic function could be in the `_get_with` method. It seems there is a flaw in the logic for handling different types of keys and determining how to retrieve the values based on the key type.

The bug likely occurred because the `_get_with` method doesn't handle all possible key types correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and failure to raise the KeyError as expected in the test function.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling different types of keys should be revisited, and a comprehensive approach for addressing each type should be implemented.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, the key types are handled more clearly, and the function should now behave as expected, addressing the bug identified in the original code.
