The error occurs in the `_get_with` function, where the key_type is being inferred as 'string' instead of 'integer' in all the test cases. This suggests that the key is not being handled correctly as an index number.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the type of the key when determining whether to treat it as a positional indexer (self.iloc) or label-based (self.loc) in the `_get_with` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the key type. We can check the type of the key and use that to determine whether to use self.iloc or self.loc.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = 'integer'  # Assume position-based indexing if in these types
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected code, we check the type of the key and set the key_type accordingly. Then, we use key_type to determine whether to use self.iloc or self.loc for indexing.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the test cases.
