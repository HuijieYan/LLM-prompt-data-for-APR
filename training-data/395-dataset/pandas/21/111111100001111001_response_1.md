Potential Error:
The bug may be due to the incorrect use of the self.loc and self.iloc methods in the conditional statements, which results in the wrong method being called.

Reason behind the Bug:
When checking the type of the 'key' parameter and calling the corresponding method, both 'self.loc' and 'self.iloc' are being called without validation. There is no conditional check to make sure that either 'loc' or 'iloc' should be called based on the data type of the 'key'. This results in invoking the wrong method.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Determine the correct method to be called based on the type of 'key' parameter, e.g., 'self.loc' for label-based indexing and 'self.iloc' for positional indexing.
2. Update the conditional checks to validate the type of 'key' and then call the appropriate method.
3. Introduce proper checks and validation for handling different data types of 'key'.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function '_get_with':

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        # Validate the type of 'key' and then call the appropriate method
        if np.isscalar(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            
            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            
            elif key_type == "string":
                return self.loc[key]
            
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected code ensures that the appropriate method (loc or iloc) is called based on the type of the 'key' parameter, and adds proper validation for different data types.
