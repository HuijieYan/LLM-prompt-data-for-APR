The bug in the given function is likely to be in the handling of the `list` indexers. When `list` is passed as the key, it should be treated similarly to the other array-like indexers, but it currently raises an error. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers like `pd.Index` or `np.array`.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is not correctly handling the `list` indexer. Instead of treating it similarly to other array-like indexers, it is raising an error.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the function treats the `list` indexer in the same way as it treats other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the implementation to handle the `list` indexer in a similar fashion as other array-like indexers.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
  
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The above corrected function now correctly handles the `list` indexer and treats it in the same way as other array-like indexers.
