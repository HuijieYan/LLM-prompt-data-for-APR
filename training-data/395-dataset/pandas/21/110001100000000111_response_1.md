Potential error location: The specific issue seems to be related to how the `ser[list(key)]` case is handled within the `_get_with` function. The error message indicates that it is not able to find any matches in the index, which suggests that the list key is not being handled correctly.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be related to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers (array-like vs. list) within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the handling of a list indexer seems to be causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and revise the logic for handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function.
2. Ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers.
3. Check if the `ser.loc[key]` behavior is consistent with the handling of array-like indexers and make necessary adjustments.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```
