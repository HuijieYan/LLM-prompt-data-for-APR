Upon analyzing the test case and the error message, it appears that the issue is related to how the `ser` Series is being indexed with a `list` key. The test is designed to check whether a specific error is raised when indexing a Series with a key that does not match any value in the index. The error message indicates that the error is not being raised as expected, suggesting that the `ser` Series is not behaving as intended when indexed with a `list` key.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function is in the handling of the `list` key. It seems that the logic for handling a `list` key is not consistent with the logic for handling other types of indexers such as arrays, Index objects, or Series.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the conditional statements and the flow of logic within the `_get_with` function. It seems that the handling of a `list` key is different from other indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior when the Series is accessed with a `list` key.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the logic for handling a `list` key is consistent with the logic for handling other indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional statements and the flow of logic within the `_get_with` function to ensure that all indexers are handled uniformly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.Index) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, the handling of a `list` key has been removed and replaced with a uniform handling for all types of indexers using the `loc` and `reindex` methods as appropriate. This should ensure consistent behavior when indexing the Series with different types of keys.
