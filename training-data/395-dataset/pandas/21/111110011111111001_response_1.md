The error occurs when the test function `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to access the `ser[key]` and expects a `KeyError` to be raised. However, the `KeyError` is not being raised, indicating that the function `ser[key]` is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the `Series` class is the `_get_with` method. The function seems to have issues with properly handling the input `key`.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems like the function is trying to handle different types of input `key` such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc. and determine the appropriate response based on the type of the input. However, it appears that different branches of the function are not handling the input correctly, resulting in the wrong behavior.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be updated to handle the different types of input `key` properly and provide the expected response in each case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code:
- The function now properly handles different types of input `key` and returns the expected response in each case.
- The conditions for checking the type of the `key` have been updated to provide the correct behavior based on the type of input.

With these corrections, the function should now handle the different types of input `key` appropriately and provide the expected response without causing any errors.
