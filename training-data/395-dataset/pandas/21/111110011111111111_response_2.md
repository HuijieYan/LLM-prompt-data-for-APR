The bug occurs when the function `Series._get_with` is called with a list as the key. The bug causes different behaviors when different types of indexers are used (`pd.Series` vs `pd.Index` vs `np.array` vs `list`) for indexing the `Series`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function should handle all types of indexers uniformly, but it is treating a list differently, which is leading to inconsistent behavior.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to handle lists uniformly with other types of indexers. Additionally, we should ensure that `ser.loc[key]` and `ser[key]` should raise the same type of error when there are no matches in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `Series._get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not pd.api.types.is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    elif not isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray, pd.Series, list)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected code handles all types of indexers uniformly, and it also ensures that `ser.loc[key]` and `ser[key]` will raise the same type of error when there are no matches in the index.
