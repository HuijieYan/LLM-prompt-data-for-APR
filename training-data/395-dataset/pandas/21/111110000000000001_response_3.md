Potential error location: The function is incorrectly handling different types of input keys, which may result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not properly handling different types of input keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, or non-list like keys.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use proper conditional checks for different types of input keys to handle them accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function can accurately determine the type of the input key and apply the corresponding logic.
3. Handle edge cases such as non-list like keys and DataFrames separately to provide specific error messages or behavior.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ["integer", "integer_array"]:
            # Use positional indexing
            return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type in ["string", "mixed-integer-float"]:
            # Use label-based indexing
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type in ["boolean"]:
            # Boolean indexing
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unrecognized key type for indexing")

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected code:
- We have added conditional checks to handle different types of keys and determine their datatype using `lib.infer_dtype`.
- Based on the datatype of the key, we use either positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`).
- We have also added a catch-all `else` block to handle unrecognized key types and raise a `ValueError`.
