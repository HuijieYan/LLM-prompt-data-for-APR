The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the key is a list properly. This is evident from the GitHub issue title that specifies the difference in behavior between `Series[index_with_no_matches]` and `Series[list_with_no_matches]`.

The error message and the GitHub issue description indicate that the problem occurs when using a list as the key for indexing, and the function does not handle this case properly, causing inconsistency in behavior.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case where the key is a list differently from other cases and ensure consistency in behavior regardless of the type of key used for indexing.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handling the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # remaining code for handling other types of keys
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # handling the case where key is not a list
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, the key is checked for being a list at the beginning of the function, and if it is a list, it is handled separately by using `self.loc[key]`. This ensures consistency in behavior for list keys and resolves the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
