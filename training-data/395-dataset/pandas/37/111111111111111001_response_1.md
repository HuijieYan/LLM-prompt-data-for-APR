The error occurs when the `astype` function is called with the `dtype` argument of `"Int64"`. The function attempts to use `np.array` to cast the values to the specified dtype, but it fails with a TypeError: data type not understood.

The potential error location is the `astype` function in the `StringArray` class. The function attempts to use `np.array` to perform the type conversion, but it doesn't handle the situation when casting to numeric types.

The reason behind the bug is that the function should handle the casting to numeric types differently from other types. When casting to numeric types, it should use the `astype` method of the underlying `ndarray` instead of directly using `np.array`.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a conditional statement to handle the casting to numeric types differently. When casting to numeric types, use the `astype` method of the underlying `ndarray`. For other types, use `np.array` as before.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    
    if is_scalar(dtype) or isinstance(dtype, (tuple, list)):
        # Handle non-numeric types
        if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            return self
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
    else:
        # Handle numeric types
        return self._ndarray.astype(dtype)
```

With this modification, the `astype` function will handle the casting to numeric types correctly, avoiding the TypeError: data type not understood error.
