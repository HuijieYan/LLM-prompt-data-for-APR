Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring within the astype method of the StringArray class in the pandas/core/arrays/string_.py file. 

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error message "TypeError: data type not understood" indicates that the astype method is not able to understand the data type provided when trying to convert from StringDtype to Int64Dtype. This could be due to a mismatch in the data type conversion or an incorrect handling of the conversion process.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One approach to fix the bug is to explicitly handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype within the astype method. This could involve checking for the presence of pd.NA and converting the string representation of numbers to the integer representation.

Corrected Code:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype) and isinstance(self, StringArray):
        if dtype == "Int64":
            new_data = []
            for val in self:
                if val is pd.NA:
                    new_data.append(pd.NA)
                else:
                    new_data.append(int(val))
            return pd.array(new_data, dtype="Int64")
        else:
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
