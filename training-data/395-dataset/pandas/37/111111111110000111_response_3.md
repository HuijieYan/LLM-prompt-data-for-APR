The error occurs in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The method attempts to convert the data using `np.array()` with the specified dtype, but it fails because the dtype is not being recognized properly.

The bug occurs because the `astype` method is not handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype correctly. The astype method is using the np.array() function, which is not the appropriate method for this type of conversion.

To fix the bug, the astype method should be modified to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype in a more appropriate way, which could involve using the `pd.to_numeric` function followed by `convert_dtypes()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    elif isinstance(dtype, type(pd.NA)):
        # Handling the conversion to Int64Dtype using pd.to_numeric
        return pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce').convert_dtypes()
    else:
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

This corrected code handles the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype appropriately by using `pd.to_numeric` followed by `convert_dtypes()` when the target dtype is Int64Dtype. This approach should address the bug and allow the conversion to happen as expected.
