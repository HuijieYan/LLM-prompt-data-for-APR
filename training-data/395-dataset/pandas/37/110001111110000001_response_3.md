Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be originating from the `astype` method within the `pandas/core/arrays/string_.py` file, specifically from the line `return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)`.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `astype` method is trying to convert the string array to a NumPy array directly using `np.array` with the specified `dtype`, which may not be working as expected for the `Int64` dtype.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `astype` method to handle the conversion to the `Int64` dtype in a way that is compatible with the string array.

Corrected Code:
```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    if isinstance(dtype, Int64Dtype):
        return pd.array([int(val) if val != pd.NA else pd.NA for val in self], dtype="Int64")
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
