The error occurs when trying to convert a StringArray with dtype "string" to dtype "Int64" using the `astype` method. This conversion should be possible, but the current implementation is causing a TypeError.

The potential error location is identified in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The following line is likely causing the issue:
```python
return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
```

The reason behind the bug is that the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class is attempting to convert the array directly to the specified dtype using `np.array`. However, this approach is not suitable for converting a string array to an integer array.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `astype` method should be modified to handle the conversion from string to integer explicitly. It may involve converting the string representations of integers to actual integer values, while handling any missing values appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    if dtype == 'Int64':
        # Convert strings to integers, handle missing values
        result = pd.to_numeric(self._ndarray, errors='coerce')
        return pd.arrays.IntegerArray(result, copy=copy)
    
    # For other dtypes, delegate to the super class method
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
This corrected implementation explicitly handles the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype, using `pd.to_numeric` to convert strings to integers and handling missing values appropriately. For other dtypes, the method delegates the conversion to the superclass.

This should resolve the TypeError when trying to convert a StringArray to Int64.
