The test case is attempting to convert a pandas StringArray to Int64 using the `astype` method, but it's failing with a `TypeError: data type not understood` error. This indicates that the dtype is not being correctly interpreted or handled by the `astype` method.

The potential error location within the `astype` method is the line:
```python
return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

The reason for the bug is that the `astype` method is not handling the conversion to the "Int64" dtype correctly. It is assuming that the dtype is always a pandas dtype, but in this case, "Int64" is a NumPy data type and needs to be handled differently.

To fix the bug, we need to determine if the provided dtype is a pandas dtype or a NumPy data type, and handle the conversion accordingly. If it's a NumPy data type, we should use NumPy's `np.array` to perform the conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    pandas_dtype = pd.api.types.pandas_dtype
    if isinstance(dtype, str):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, pd.StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    elif isinstance(dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
        # Convert to NumPy array with 'dtype'
        return np.array(self, dtype='int64')
    else:
        # For other pandas dtypes, use the original astype method
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
