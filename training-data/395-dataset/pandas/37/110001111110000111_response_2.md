Potential Error location:
The issue occurs within the `astype` function in the `pandas/core/arrays/string_.py` file. Specifically, the problem arises when trying to cast a StringDtype series to an Int64Dtype.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the conversion from a StringDtype to an Int64Dtype. It attempts to use `super().astype()` to perform the conversion, which leads to a TypeError because the data type is not understood.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type of the elements in the series before attempting the conversion.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the conversion and provide a fallback method if the direct conversion fails.
3. Implement a specific conversion method for StringDtype to Int64Dtype within the `astype` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype) and str(dtype) == 'Int64':
        try:
            return self._from_sequence(self._data, dtype=dtype)
        except TypeError:
            # Fallback method if direct conversion fails
            return self._data.astype('Int64')
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
