Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the handling of dtype conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype in the `astype` method.

Reasons behind the bug: The `astype` method is not handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype properly, resulting in TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach is to check for StringDtype specifically and handle the conversion to Int64Dtype accordingly. Additionally, ensuring proper error handling and data type conversion should be considered.

Corrected code:
```python
import pandas.api.types as ptypes

def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    if ptypes.is_string_dtype(self) and ptypes.is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        return self.astype('Int64', copy=copy)
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
