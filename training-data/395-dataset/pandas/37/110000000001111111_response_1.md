The given buggy function is designed to convert a pandas series to a specified data type. The bug seems to occur when trying to convert a series of StringDtype to Int64Dtype.

Upon analyzing the test case and the associated detailed issue description, it can be inferred that the bug occurs when trying to convert from StringDtype to Int64Dtype using the `astype` function. This results in a TypeError "data type not understood".

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype correctly. The `astype` function is not able to directly convert between these types resulting in the TypeError. 

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype. One possible approach is to use `pd.to_numeric` to convert the StringDtype series to numeric and then use `convert_dtypes` to convert it to Int64Dtype.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    if isinstance(dtype, str) and dtype.lower() == 'int64':
        return pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce').convert_dtypes()
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

This corrected function checks if the specified dtype is 'int64' and if so, it uses `pd.to_numeric` and `convert_dtypes` to perform the conversion, addressing the bug.
