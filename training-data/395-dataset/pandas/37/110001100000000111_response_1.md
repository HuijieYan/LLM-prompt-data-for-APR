The error is likely located in the if statement checking if the dtype is a StringDtype. This if statement is not handling the case where the dtype is 'Int64' correctly. The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64.

To fix the bug, the if statement should be modified to check for 'Int64' dtype as well. Additionally, the function should handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64 explicitly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, (StringDtype, pd.Int64Dtype)):
        if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            return self
        else:
            # Explicitly handle conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype
            # Assuming self is a Series
            try:
                return self.astype(str).astype(int)
            except ValueError:
                raise ValueError("Unable to convert to Int64")
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
