The error occurs when trying to convert a Series with StringDtype to Int64Dtype using the `astype` method. The current implementation of the `astype` method does not handle this conversion correctly.

The bug is likely located in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The method should be able to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype, but it currently produces a TypeError when attempting to do so.

The reason behind the bug is that the `astype` method does not have a specific implementation for converting from StringDtype to Int64Dtype. This causes the method to fall back to the default implementation, which results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `astype` method should be updated to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype specifically. This can be achieved by checking the target dtype and implementing the appropriate conversion logic for StringDtype to Int64Dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
# this is the corrected astype method
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype) and isinstance(self._ndarray.dtype, object):
        if dtype == "Int64":
            new_dtype = pd.Int64Dtype()
            arr = np.array(self._ndarray, dtype="string")
            mask = pd.isna(arr)
            values = pd.to_numeric(arr, errors="coerce")
            values[mask] = pd.NA
            return pd.array(values, dtype=new_dtype)
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Cannot convert to {dtype}")
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

The corrected `astype` method checks if the target dtype is "Int64" and the current dtype is StringDtype, then it performs the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype using the appropriate logic. If the target dtype is not "Int64" or the current dtype is not StringDtype, it falls back to the default behavior.

With this corrected `astype` method, the error should be resolved and the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype should work as expected.
