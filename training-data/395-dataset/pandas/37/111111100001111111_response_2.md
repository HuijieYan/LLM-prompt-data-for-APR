The issue appears to be with the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class when trying to convert from a `StringDtype` to an `Int64Dtype`.

The bug occurs because the `astype` method is not handling the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` correctly. It is not recognizing the desired data type and is raising a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `astype` method should check if the target `dtype` is `Int64Dtype` and handle the conversion appropriately. It should also handle missing values (`<NA>`) correctly during the conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    elif isinstance(dtype, Int64Dtype):
        arr = np.array(self._ndarray, dtype='Int64')
        mask = self.isna()
        arr[mask] = pd.NA
        return arr
    else:
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

This corrected code includes a check for the target `dtype` being `Int64Dtype`. If it is, it converts the values to the appropriate numeric type and handles missing values correctly.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub issue by allowing the direct conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` using the `astype` method.
