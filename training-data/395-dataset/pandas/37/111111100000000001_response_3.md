The potential error in the `astype` method is in the `if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype)` block. 

The bug occurs because the `astype` method in the `StringArray` class is incorrectly using the `isinstance` function to check if the dtype is an instance of `StringDtype`. This approach will always return False because the dtype passed to the method is not an instance of `StringDtype` but rather a string representing the dtype.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the condition to check if the dtype is equal to 'string' instead of using `isinstance` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if dtype == 'string':
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
