The bug is occurring in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class when trying to convert a StringDtype series to an Int64Dtype. The TypeError is caused by the way the `astype` method is currently implemented.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `astype` method does not handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype properly. It checks if the input `dtype` is an instance of StringDtype, but it doesn't handle the case where the target `dtype` is Int64Dtype.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype explicitly. This can be achieved by converting the string values to integers and then returning the result with the Int64Dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    elif issubclass(dtype.type, np.integer) and isinstance(self._ndarray.dtype, np.object_):
        arr = self._ndarray
        mask = self._ndarray_isna
        values = pd.to_numeric(arr, errors='coerce')
        values[mask] = pd.NA
        return values.astype(dtype)
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

In this corrected code, we added a condition to handle the conversion to Int64Dtype explicitly. We use `pd.to_numeric` to convert the string values to integers, handle NA values, and then return the result with the Int64Dtype. This approach should fix the bug and allow the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype to work as expected.
