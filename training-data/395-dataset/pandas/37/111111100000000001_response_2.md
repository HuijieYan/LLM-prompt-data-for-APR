Potential error location: The potential error is in the conditional statement `if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype)`. This statement is checking if the `dtype` is an instance of the `StringDtype` class. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug might occur if `StringDtype` is not properly defined or imported in the code. It could also occur if the `dtype` parameter is not being passed correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `StringDtype` class is properly defined and imported in the code.
2. Check that the `dtype` parameter is being passed correctly to the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas.api.types.pandas_dtype(dtype)  # Assuming pandas_dtype is a function that should be replaced with pandas.api.types.pandas_dtype
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):  # Assuming StringDtype is the correct class
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
