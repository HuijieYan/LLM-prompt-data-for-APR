The bug in the provided code is likely occurring at the point where the `astype` function tries to convert a `StringDtype` to an `Int64Dtype`. This results in a TypeError: "data type not understood" because the conversion is not being handled correctly.

The reason behind the bug is that the `astype` function is not handling the `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` conversion properly, resulting in a data type not being understood.

To fix this bug, the `astype` function should handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` explicitly. This can be achieved using the `pd.to_numeric` function followed by `convert_dtypes` as demonstrated in the GitHub issue description.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` function that handles the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype`:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if dtype == "Int64":
            return pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce').convert_dtypes()
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

This code explicitly checks if the `dtype` is "Int64" and then uses `pd.to_numeric` followed by `convert_dtypes` to handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype`.
