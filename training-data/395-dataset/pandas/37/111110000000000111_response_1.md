Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the `astype` function within the `StringArray` class. The function is not correctly handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `astype` function is not handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype properly. It is not recognizing the intended dtype and is failing to perform the conversion.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `astype` function to explicitly handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype.
2. Implement a check for the target dtype and perform the appropriate conversion based on the source and target dtypes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    source_dtype = self.dtype
    if source_dtype == "string" and dtype == "Int64":
        coerce_numeric = pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce')
        if copy:
            return coerce_numeric.copy()
        return coerce_numeric
    else:
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
