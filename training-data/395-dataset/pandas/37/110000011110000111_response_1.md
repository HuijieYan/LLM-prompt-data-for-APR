The error occurs when trying to convert a StringDtype series to an Int64Dtype using the `astype` method. The error message indicates a "TypeError: data type not understood" when trying to perform this conversion.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return super().astype(dtype, copy)` line. This line attempts to use the `astype` method from the parent class without taking into account the specific handling required for StringDtype series.

The bug occurs because the `astype` method in the provided function does not have specific handling for StringDtype series when the target dtype is Int64. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the provided function to check for the target dtype being Int64 and handle it differently for StringDtype series.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype) and str(dtype) == 'Int64':
        return pd.array([int(x) if x and x != pd.NA else pd.NA for x in self._ndarray], dtype='Int64')
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

In the corrected code:
- We check if the target dtype is `Int64` and handle it differently for StringDtype series.
- We iterate through the elements in the array and convert them to integers, handling the `pd.NA` value appropriately.
- If the target dtype is not `Int64`, we retain the existing behavior for StringDtype series and handle the conversion accordingly.
- For other dtypes, we call the parent class's `astype` method.

This modification should resolve the issue when converting a StringDtype series to an Int64Dtype.
