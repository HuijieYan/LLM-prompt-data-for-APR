Potential error location: 
The potential error location in the code is the line `dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)`. It seems that `pandas_dtype` is not a defined function, which is causing the error.

Reason behind the bug:
The error is occurring because the function `pandas_dtype` is not defined, and thus it is causing the `dtype` variable to not be properly handled.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct function to convert the `dtype` to the appropriate type.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the conversion and provide a fallback option if the conversion fails.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    try:
        dtype = pd.api.types.infer_dtype(dtype)
    except AttributeError:
        dtype = pd.api.types.pandas_dtype(dtype)
    
    if isinstance(dtype, pd.StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
