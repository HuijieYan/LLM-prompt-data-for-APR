The potential error in the provided function is that it is not handling the case where the dtype is not a StringDtype. This could lead to a 'TypeError' if the dtype is not a StringDtype.

To fix this bug, we need to add an else condition to the if statement to handle the case when dtype is not a StringDtype. We can simply call the super().astype() method to handle the dtype conversion in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    else:
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
