The error occurs when trying to convert a StringDtype series to an Int64Dtype using the `astype` method. The error message indicates that the data type is not understood.

The bug is located in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The `astype` method does not handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype correctly, resulting in a TypeError.

The reason behind the bug is that the current implementation of the `astype` method does not handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype properly.

To fix the bug, the `astype` method needs to be modified to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    if issubclass(dtype.type, np.integer) and not issubclass(dtype.type, np.bool_):
        array = np.array(self._ndarray, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
        return self._from_sequence(array, dtype=dtype)
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

With this correction, the `astype` method will correctly handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype and avoid the TypeError.

After applying this fix, the test function `test_astype_int` should pass without any errors.
