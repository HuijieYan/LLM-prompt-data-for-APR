The error occurs in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The method seems to be trying to cast the `StringArray` to a NumPy array with the specified data type, but it does so by directly calling `np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)`, which results in a TypeError: data type not understood.

The reason for the bug is that the `astype` method is not handling the conversion from a string to another type (in this case, from StringDtype to Int64Dtype) correctly. Specifically, it is not recognizing how to handle the conversion for the specific types involved.

To fix the bug, the `astype` method should be modified to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype explicitly. This can be achieved by converting the strings to the desired type using appropriate built-in Python functions.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    # Convert to the target dtype if it's Int64Dtype
    if dtype == 'Int64' or isinstance(dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
        # Convert the StringArray to numeric, coercing errors to NaN
        numeric_array = pd.to_numeric(self._ndarray, errors='coerce')
        # Convert the numeric array to Int64
        arr = pd.array(numeric_array, dtype='Int64')
        return arr

    # Use the original astype implementation for other dtypes
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

In this corrected code, if the target dtype is 'Int64' or an instance of `pd.Int64Dtype`, the `astype` method handles the conversion by coercing the string array to a numeric array (treating errors as NaN) and then converting the numeric array to Int64. For other dtypes, it falls back to the original implementation.
