The problem is with the `astype` method in the `StringArray` class. When `astype` is called with a dtype of "Int64", it tries to use `np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)` to convert the array to an integer array, but it fails with a TypeError: data type not understood.

The reason for the bug is that the `astype` method in the `StringArray` class does not handle the conversion to "Int64" properly. It should be able to convert a StringDtype series to an Inte64Dtype directly, but it's currently not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `astype` method in the `StringArray` class to handle the conversion to "Int64" dtype properly. We can check if the dtype is "Int64" and then use `pd.to_numeric` to perform the conversion. 

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    elif isinstance(dtype, Int64Dtype):
        return pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce').astype(dtype)
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
