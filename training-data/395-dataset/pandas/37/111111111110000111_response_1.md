The test case is trying to convert a series of strings with some missing values (pd.NA) to an Int64 type using the astype method. However, it's encountering a TypeError: data type not understood.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line:
```python
return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
```
This line is attempting to convert the string array to a NumPy array with the specified dtype, but it's causing a TypeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype is not directly supported by the astype method.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype specifically within the astype method of the StringArray class. Since StringDtype may contain missing values, it needs to be handled carefully. We can use the to_numeric function with errors='coerce' to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    elif isinstance(dtype, Int64Dtype):
        # Convert the StringDtype to Int64Dtype by first converting to numeric and then converting to Int64Dtype
        numeric_result = pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce')
        return numeric_result.astype(dtype)

    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

With this modification, the astype method of the StringArray class will now handle the specific case of converting from StringDtype to Int64Dtype correctly, by first converting to numeric and then to the target dtype.
