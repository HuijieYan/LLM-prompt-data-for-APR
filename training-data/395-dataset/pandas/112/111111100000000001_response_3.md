The buggy function is `get_indexer` within the `IntervalIndex` class. The function seems to be trying to handle certain cases when the target index is an `IntervalIndex` and when it's a scalar index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:`. The intention seems to be to check whether the intervals in the `IntervalIndex` overlap, but the check is missing the function call parentheses. It should be `if self.is_overlapping():`.

The bug occurred because the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:` doesn't call the `is_overlapping` method. Instead, it just checks if the method exists, which will always return `True` because the method does exist.

To fix the bug, the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:` should be changed to `if self.is_overlapping():` to actually call the `is_overlapping` method and check its result.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Fixed the conditional check
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
