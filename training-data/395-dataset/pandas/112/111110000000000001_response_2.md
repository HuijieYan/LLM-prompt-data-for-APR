Potential error location: The condition `if self.is_overlapping:` is missing parentheses to call the `is_overlapping` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: Without the parentheses, `self.is_overlapping` is not being called as a method, so the condition is not evaluating the result of the method. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `is_overlapping` is supposed to return a value that determines the flow of the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Add parentheses to `self.is_overlapping` to call it as a method and evaluate its result properly in the conditional statement.

Corrected code:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
                Raises
