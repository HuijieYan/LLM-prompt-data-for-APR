The error occurs when trying to round the data in a dataframe with columns as CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The error message "TypeError: No matching signature found" indicates that there is an issue with the rounding function when dealing with CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `get_indexer` method, as this method is specifically related to indexers and can impact operations like rounding.

The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` method does not handle CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex properly, leading to a TypeError when trying to round the data.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method to handle CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex correctly. Specifically, we need to update the logic within the `get_indexer` method to account for this specific scenario and ensure that the rounding operation works as expected.

Here's the corrected `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    # handling CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex
    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        target_as_index = ensure_index(target.categories)
        indexer = self.get_indexer(target_as_index, method, limit, tolerance)
    else:
        if self.is_overlapping:
            msg = (
                "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
                "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
            )
            raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
        
        # rest of the original logic...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected method, we first check if the target is a CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex. If it is, we extract the IntervalIndex from the CategoricalIndex and call the `get_indexer` method recursively. This ensures that the rounding operation will work correctly for CategoricalIndex of IntervalIndex.

With this fix, the rounding operation should work as expected for dataframes with CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.
