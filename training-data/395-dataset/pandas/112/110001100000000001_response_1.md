The error message "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique" suggests that the function is not able to handle overlapping indices.

Upon reviewing the code, the potential error location appears to be in the if statement `if self.is_overlapping`. The if statement checks if the index is overlapping. However, it seems that `self.is_overlapping` should be a method call, not a property. It should be `self.is_overlapping()` to actually invoke the method and check if the index is overlapping.

The bug occurs because `self.is_overlapping` is being treated as a property or attribute of the class, rather than a method call. As a result, the condition `if self.is_overlapping` is always considered truthy, leading to the error message being raised.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to call the `is_overlapping` method as `self.is_overlapping()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the `is_overlapping` method will be correctly called and the bug related to handling overlapping indices can be resolved.
