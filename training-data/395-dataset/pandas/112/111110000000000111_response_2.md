The error is occurring in the `get_indexer` function of the `IntervalIndex` class. It seems that the function is not handling the case when the input target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, which is causing the `round` method to fail in the provided test case.

The reason behind the bug is that the `get_indexer` function is not equipped to handle the case where the input target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This causes the `round` method to fail when the columns are of this type.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` function needs to be modified to handle the case when the input target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        # Handle both IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        # rest of the code goes here...

    # rest of the code goes here...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check for `CategoricalIndex` and handled it as a special case, ensuring that the `get_indexer` function can now handle cases where the input target is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This should resolve the issue with the `round` method failing.
