The issue seems to be related to the `get_indexer` function, which is used when calling the `round` method on a DataFrame with a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. The error message indicates that there is no matching signature found, which suggests that there might be an issue with how the function is handling the input data.

The bug seems to occur because the `get_indexer` function does not handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly, resulting in a TypeError when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with such columns.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_indexer` function to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, Interval):
        indexer = target_as_index.categories.get_indexer(self)
    else:
        indexer = np.searchsorted(self, target_as_index, side="left")

    return indexer
```

This updated code checks if the input is a CategoricalIndex with categories of type Interval. If so, it calls the `get_indexer` method on the categories with the `self` (which is the IntervalIndex) as the argument. For other cases, it falls back to using `np.searchsorted` to get the indexer.

With this update, the `get_indexer` function should be able to handle CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex properly, and the `round` method should work as expected.
