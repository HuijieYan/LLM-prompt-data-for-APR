The error occurs when trying to use the `round()` method on a DataFrame with an IntervalIndex as the column index. The error message points to an issue with the `get_indexer` method in the `pandas` library.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_indexer` method, particularly where it specifies the signature as `def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray:`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method signature is not compatible with other parts of the code or the specific use case in the test. It leads to a TypeError when trying to invoke the `get_indexer` method.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the method signature to ensure compatibility with the DataFrame's usage in the given test case. Additionally, any internal logic within the method that might cause issues should be reviewed and possibly adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected get_indexer method
def get_indexer(self, target: IntervalIndex, method: Optional[str]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise pd.errors.InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the logic remains the same...
    # (Please note that the argument `limit` is removed from the method signature as it was not used in the original code or the given test case)
```

By modifying the method signature to accept an `IntervalIndex` directly and removing the `limit` parameter (as it was not being used), the function should be more compatible with the specific use case in the given test.
