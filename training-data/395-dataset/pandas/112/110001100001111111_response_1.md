The error message and the GitHub issue title suggest that the problem occurs when using the `round` method on a DataFrame with columns that are a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. It seems that the issue is related to handling IntervalIndex within a CategoricalIndex.

Based on the variable runtime values and types provided, the potential error location within the buggy function seems to be in the `get_indexer` method where it tries to handle the case of a homogeneous scalar index (IntervalIndex) and a non-object dtype. This part of the code involves comparing the left and right indices to check for matches, and it may not be handling the case of CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex correctly.

The bug occurs because the `get_indexer` method does not account for the specific behavior of a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, leading to a TypeError when the `round` method is called on a DataFrame with such columns.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method should be modified to handle the specific case of a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex, ensuring that the rounding operation works as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target_as_index.categories, pd.IntervalIndex):
        indexer = target_as_index.codes
    else:
        indexer = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    return indexer
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the case where the `target` is a CategoricalIndex with categories being a IntervalIndex. In this case, we use the `.codes` attribute of the CategoricalIndex to get the indexer, ensuring that the rounding operation works as expected for this specific case.
