The potential error in the provided function is related to the manipulation and transformation of data using NumPy operations. The code attempts to handle missing values (NaN or NaT) and then performs calculations to determine the number of unique elements in the group.

The error could occur due to improper handling of missing values or incorrect manipulation of indexes and data arrays during the NumPy operations.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that missing values are handled properly, and the NumPy operations are conducted accurately to identify unique elements within each group.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
    """
    Return the number of unique elements in the group.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Number of unique values within each group.
    """
    val = self.obj._internal_get_values()

    if dropna:
        unique_vals = np.unique(val[~pd.isnull(val)])
    else:
        unique_vals = np.unique(val)

    group_sizes = np.bincount(self.grouper.group_info[0])
    result = Series(group_sizes, index=self.grouper.result_index)
    result.index.name = self._selection_name()
    return result
```
