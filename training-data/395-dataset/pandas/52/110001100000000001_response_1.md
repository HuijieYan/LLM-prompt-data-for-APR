Potential error location: 
The error could be caused by the use of the _selection_name method in the return statement. The method is not being called with the correct syntax.

Reason behind the bug:
The _selection_name method is being used incorrectly in the return statement, which is causing the bug.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Use the _selection_name method with the correct syntax in the return statement.

Corrected code:

```python
def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
    """
    Return number of unique elements in the group.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Number of unique values within each group.
    """
    # ... (previous code unchanged) ...

    result = Series(res, index=ri, name=self._selection_name())
    return self._reindex_output(result, fill_value=0)
```
