The issue seems to be related to the modification of null values when using the nunique function on a grouped DataFrame. The bug seems to have been introduced in version 1.0.0, as the DataFrame is being modified with unexpected values.

Upon analyzing the nunique function, the bug likely occurs when handling null values in the DataFrame. The function is modifying null values and assigning unexpected values to them.

To fix this bug, we can modify the nunique function to handle null values correctly and ensure that the original DataFrame is not modified.

Here's the corrected code for the nunique function:

```python
def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
    """
    Return number of unique elements in the group.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Number of unique values within each group.
    """
    result = self.obj.groupby(self.key).nunique(dropna=dropna)
    return self._wrap_result(result, name="nunique")
```

In the corrected code, we are using the built-in `groupby` and `nunique` functions of the DataFrame to calculate the number of unique elements in the group. This approach ensures that null values are handled correctly and the original DataFrame is not modified.
