The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the manipulation and processing of the 'val' and 'ids' arrays, as well as the handling of NaN/NaT values.

The bug is likely caused by the presence of NaN/NaT values in the 'val' array, which leads to unexpected behavior as the code attempts to handle these values. Additionally, there might be issues related to the processing of unique elements in the group, resulting in incorrect results.

To fix the bug, it is important to handle NaN/NaT values appropriately and ensure that the processing of unique values in the group is done accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
    """
    Return number of unique elements in the group.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Number of unique values within each group.
    """
    val = self.obj._internal_get_values()

    if dropna:
        unique_vals = np.unique(val[~pd.isna(val)])
        num_unique = pd.Series([len(unique_vals)] * len(self.grouper.result_index), index=self.grouper.result_index, name=self._selection_name())
    else:
        unique_vals, idx = np.unique(val, return_index=True)
        num_unique = pd.Series([len(unique_vals)] * len(self.grouper.result_index), index=self.grouper.result_index, name=self._selection_name())
    
    return self._reindex_output(num_unique, fill_value=0)
```
