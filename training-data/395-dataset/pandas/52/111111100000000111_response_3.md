Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring when the function is trying to handle null values during the calculation of unique elements within each group.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug appears to be caused by the handling of null values in the nunique function, which leads to modifications in the original dataframe.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: It seems that the code is incorrectly handling null values, resulting in unexpected modifications to the original dataframe. This can be fixed by revisiting the code that deals with null values and correcting the logic to ensure that the original dataframe is not modified.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
        """
        Return number of unique elements in the group.
    
        Returns
        -------
        Series
            Number of unique values within each group.
        """
        ids, _, _ = self.grouper.group_info

        val = self.obj._internal_get_values()

        # GH 27951
        # temporary fix while we wait for NumPy bug 12629 to be fixed
        val_copy = val.copy()  # Create a copy of the values to avoid modifying the original array
        val_copy[pd.isna(val_copy)] = np.datetime64("NaT")

        try:
            sorter = np.lexsort((val_copy, ids))
        except TypeError:  # catches object dtypes
            msg = f"val.dtype must be object, got {val_copy.dtype}"
            assert val_copy.dtype == object, msg
            val_copy, _ = algorithms.factorize(val_copy, sort=False)
            sorter = np.lexsort((val_copy, ids))
            _isna = lambda a: a == -1
        else:
            _isna = pd.isna

        ids, val_copy = ids[sorter], val_copy[sorter]

        # Rest of the function remains the same
```

The corrected code includes creating a copy of the 'val' array and modifying the copy to avoid modifying the original dataframe. This should prevent the bug where the original dataframe was being modified.
