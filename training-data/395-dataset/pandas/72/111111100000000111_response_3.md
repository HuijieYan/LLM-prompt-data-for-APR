The error seems to be related to setting a Categorical value for a column in a one-row DataFrame, which results in the dtype being returned as object instead of a CategoricalDtype. This inconsistency occurs when setting the column using df.loc[:,'Alpha'] = codes.

The bug is likely within the setitem method of the Block class. This method is responsible for setting the value inplace and returning a maybe different typed block.

The bug is occurring because the method is not handling the case of a Categorical value properly. It is coercing the value to a common dtype, but is not considering the case where the value is a Categorical dtype.

To fix the bug, the setitem method needs to be modified to handle the case of a Categorical value properly. It should check if the value is a Categorical dtype and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the setitem method:

```python
def setitem(self, indexer, value):
    if isinstance(value, pd.Categorical):
        values = self.values
        values[indexer] = pd.Categorical(value)
    else:
        # existing logic for setting values
        transpose = self.ndim == 2
        # ...
        # existing logic for handling dtype and length checking
        # ...

        if transpose:
            values = values.T

        # set
        values[indexer] = value

        if transpose:
            values = values.T
        block = self.make_block(values)
        return block
```

This fix checks if the value is a Categorical dtype, and if it is, it sets the values accordingly. If the value is not a Categorical dtype, the existing logic for setting values is used. This should ensure that the dtype is preserved when setting a Categorical value for a column in a one-row DataFrame.
