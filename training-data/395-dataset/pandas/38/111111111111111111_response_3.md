The potential error in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in the line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`. Since `i` is not defined and appears to be an unintended variable, it is likely causing the 'IndexError' with message "Too many levels: Index has only 2 levels, not 3". 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable 'i' is being used without initialization, leading to an unintended comparison that causes the bug.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to use a different variable for the comparison with 'v' in the list comprehension. For example, using a variable like 'val' instead of 'i' would make the code syntactically correct.

Here's the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... omitted code ...

    val = len(clocs) - 1  # Getting the maximum value in clocs list
    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # ... remaining code ...
    return unstacked
```

This correction entails replacing the problematic line with `clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]` to avoid the unintended behavior that causes the bug.

This correction should ensure that the comparison is done correctly without raising the 'IndexError'.
