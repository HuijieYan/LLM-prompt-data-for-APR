The issue appears to be caused by the `_unstack_multiple` function, which is not properly handling the unstacking of multi-level columns.

The error messages from the test cases "test_unstack_long_index", "test_unstack_multi_level_cols", and "test_unstack_multi_level_rows_and_cols" indicate that the multi-level unstacking of rows and columns is not working as expected. The error messages point to index and level mismatch issues. In addition, the error messages also indicate that the indices are not being unstacked properly.

Upon further inspection, it appears that the issue lies in the `_unstack_multiple` function where the variable `clocs` is incorrectly processed. The line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]` most likely is causing the issue as `i` is not defined in the function.

To fix this bug, the correction should involve using the correct variable `val` instead of `i` as the comparison value and also make sure to replace `i > v` condition with `val > v`. This will ensure that the level numbering is processed correctly.

Here's the corrected function for the problematic `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... omitted code ...

    index = data.index

    # GH 19966 Make sure if MultiIndexed index has tuple name, they will be
    # recognised as a whole
    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... omitted code ...

    # Correct the line by using 'val' as the comparison value
    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # ... omitted code ...
```

With these corrections, the `_unstack_multiple` method should properly handle the unstacking of multi-level columns and resolve the issues mentioned in the test cases and error messages.
