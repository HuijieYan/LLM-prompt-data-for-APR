The issue in the given code is that the variable `clocs` is being used to identify the column location, but it is actually an array of column names. This causes the code to break when using `clocs in index.names`, as `clocs` is not a valid input for this operation.

To fix this issue, the `clocs` variable should be converted into the corresponding numeric level numbers before using it in the subsequent operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `unstack` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert column names to level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

By converting the column names in `clocs` to their corresponding level numbers, the code will now correctly identify the levels to be unstacked and perform the operations accordingly. This will resolve the issues identified in the test cases and the error messages associated with them.
