The error message indicates an issue with unstacking multi-level rows and columns. It seems that the bug is in the `_unstack_multiple` function in the `reshape.py` file. The code for unstacking multiple hierarchical columns is complex and needs to be carefully examined.

The error message from the first test function indicates a problem with handling multi-level indices. It seems that the code is not able to properly handle multi-level indices when unstacking, leading to an AssertionError.

The error message from the second test function also suggests a problem with unstacking multi-level columns. It indicates a mismatch between expected and actual column names after unstacking. This points to a potential issue with handling columns with multiple levels.

For the last test function, the error message indicates a difference in the index values after unstacking. This suggests an issue with retaining the correct index values when unstacking multi-level rows and columns.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be revised to properly handle unstacking of hierarchical columns and index. The code should ensure that multi-level indices and columns are correctly unstacked without losing the hierarchical structure.

The following is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Unstacking columns
    result = data
    for i in range(len(clocs)):
        val = clocs[i]
        result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
        clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # Unstacking index
    for c in range(len(clocs)):
        val = clocs[c]
        result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
        clocs = [v if c > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    return result
```

This revised function should be able to properly unstack hierarchical columns and indices without encountering the previously observed errors.
