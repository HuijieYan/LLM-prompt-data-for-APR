The error in the `_unstack_multiple` function is due to the way it handles MultiIndex levels and names. The function is trying to access a level by its name, but it does not handle the case when the level has a tuple name correctly.

The first step is to update the logic of handling the `clocs` to ensure it properly checks for hierarchical columns. Then, the function should correctly create a MultiIndex based on the given input data.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # New code to handle hierarchical column names
    index = data.index
    cloc_indices = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if cloc in index.names:
            cloc_indices.append(index.names.index(cloc))
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Level {cloc} not found")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_indices]
    
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in cloc_indices]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    # Rest of the function remains the same as in the original code
    # ...
```

With these changes, the function should handle the multi-level indices and columns correctly and resolve the errors reported in the test cases.
