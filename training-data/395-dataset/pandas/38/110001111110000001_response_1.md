The error is occurring in the function `_unstack_multiple` within the `pandas.core.reshape.reshape` file. The error is being triggered by the attempt to find the index of a level within a multi-index. The code is expecting a level number but is receiving the name of the level, leading to an error.

The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is not handling hierarchical index columns correctly. It tries to unstack the index using different columns and levels, but the logic seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles the case of hierarchical index columns. It should properly unstack the data based on the specified levels and columns. Additionally, the function should be a standalone function instead of being nested within another function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function. It is now a standalone function with the correct logic for unstacking a DataFrame with a multi-level index.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(
        levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
        codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
        names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
        verify_integrity=False,
    )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
