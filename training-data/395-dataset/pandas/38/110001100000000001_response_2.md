Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the section of the function that handles unstacking the data and multiple index levels.

Reason for the bug: The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of multiple index levels and unstacking the data.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of multi-indexing when unstacking the data.
2. Verify that the code handles both Series and DataFrame inputs correctly.
3. Check for any indexing or column name inconsistencies that could lead to errors.

Corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```
