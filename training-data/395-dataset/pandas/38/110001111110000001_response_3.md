The error occurs when the `unstack` method is called with multiple levels. The error message indicates that the indexing is incorrectly handled and the DataFrame is not unstacked as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of indices and columns when unstacking.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect handling of multi-indices and columns when unstacking in the `_unstack_multiple` function. In particular, the code does not properly handle multi-level columns and rows when unstacking.

To fix the bug, the code within the `_unstack_multiple` function must be modified to properly handle multi-level indices and columns when unstacking.

Here's the corrected code for the `unstack` method:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # GH 19966 Make sure if MultiIndexed index has tuple name, they will be
    # recognised as a whole
    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # ... previous code to handle the group index, etc.

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(result.columns.names[val], fill_value=fill_value)

        return result

    # ... continuing code to handle the unstacking and creation of new columns and indexing.
```

With the corrected code, the `unstack` method should handle multi-level columns and indices properly, addressing the issues reported in the test cases.
