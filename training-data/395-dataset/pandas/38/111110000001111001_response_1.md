The issue with the provided function is that it has various parts that use different methods based on specific conditions and checks. This makes the function overly complex and difficult to understand, which can lead to errors.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the flow of the function by reducing the conditional branches and using consistent methods across different parts of the function.
2. Ensure that the input parameters are handled consistently and the unstacking operation is performed uniformly for different types of input data.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    unstacked.index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.index)
    return unstacked
```
This corrected function follows a simpler and more consistent approach in unstacking multiple levels in the DataFrame or Series. It removes unnecessary conditional complexity and simplifies the unstacking operation.
