The issue appears to be related to the unstacking of a DataFrame with multi-level indices and columns. The error messages indicate that the bug is occurring within the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the process of unstacking multiple levels of indices and columns.

The bug seems to stem from a mistyping in the code at line 366 of `pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py`, specifically in the following line of code:
```python
clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
```

The reasons behind the bug occurrence are as follows:
1. The variable `val` is not defined in this context, and it is unclear what `val` should represent.
2. The usage of the variable `i` within this line of code is mixed up and might not serve the intended purpose.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be revised to ensure that the correct condition is being checked and that the correct variables are being used in the list comprehension.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    clocs = [v if 'i' + str(i) > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the code)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected code, the conditional expression in the list comprehension has been revised to use the appropriate comparison based on the variable names and the nature of the comparison.

This fix should address the bug related to the unstacking of a DataFrame with multi-level indices and columns and resolve the associated error messages.
