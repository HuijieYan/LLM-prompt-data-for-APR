The problematic function is `_unstack_multiple`, and the error message pertains to the `assert` statement in the test case. 

The error in the function occurs when trying to unstack multiple levels, which leads to inconsistencies in the index names, causing the tests to fail. 

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to check the number of levels before and after unstacking, and ensure that the index names are consistent. Additionally, creating a more systematic approach to handling multi-level indices may help avoid these kinds of errors.

Below is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # If MultiIndexed index is used, ensure consistency in the names
    if isinstance(data.index, pd.MultiIndex):
        if set(clocs) != set(data.index.names):
            # Sort the index names to maintain consistency
            clocs.sort()
            data = data.reorder_levels(clocs)

    # Unstack the data
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function ensures consistency in the index names and ensures that the unstacking operation is performed correctly.
