The given buggy function is intended to unstack multi-index columns in a pandas DataFrame. It appears that there are issues with handling MultiIndex columns and label-based unstacking.

Looking at the function, there is a mistake that occurs due to assigning the variable `clocs`. The condition in the line below refers to variable `i` which doesn't seem to be properly initialized or defined in the function.
```python
clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
```
It seems that there is an intended comparison with another variable but instead the variable `i` is used. This is likely a mistake in the code.

It appears that the overall issue in the function is due to incorrect handling of MultiIndex columns and problems with label-based unstacking.

To fix this bug, the function should properly handle MultiIndex columns and unstacking operations based on the provided labels. The conditions and loops need meticulous re-evaluation and correct usage of the indices.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if all([cloc in index.names for cloc in clocs]):  # Check if clocs is in index.names
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # Rest of the function
    # ...

    # Correction is needed in the following line: clocs should be replaced with val
    clocs = [val if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # Rest of the function
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

By properly comparing the values using `val` and addressing any other potential issues in the function, the bug can be resolved. After implementing such fixes and updating the rest of the function accordingly, it should be capable of correctly handling MultiIndex columns and the label-based unstacking operations.
