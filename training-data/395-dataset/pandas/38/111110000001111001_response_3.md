Error:
The bug occurs when the function tries to check if the `clocs` appears in the `index.names`. The comparison `if clocs in index.names` will not work as intended because `clocs` is a list and `index.names` is a `FrozenList`. 

Potential bug location:
The bug is likely to be in the comparison `if clocs in index.names`.

Reason for the bug:
The `clocs` variable is a list, and the `index.names` is a `FrozenList`. The `in` operator does not work as intended for this comparison.

Approach to fix the bug:
Use set operations to compare the list `clocs` with the `FrozenList` `index.names`.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # GH 19966 Make sure if MultiIndexed index has tuple name, they will be
    # recognised as a whole
    if set(clocs).issubset(index.names):  # using set operation to check if clocs is a subset of index.names
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```
