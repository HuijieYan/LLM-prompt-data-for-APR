The error in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to stem from the handling of the `clocs` variable. The code snippet `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]` is likely the cause of the issue, as `i` may not be properly defined, leading to an index error.

The `clocs` variable appears to represent specific locations within a MultiIndex, and the goal is to unstack the DataFrame based on these locations. However, the code is complex and the logic for selecting the locations is difficult to decipher.

A potential approach to fixing the bug would involve carefully revisiting the logic for selecting the locations and ensuring that the selected levels are appropriate for unstacking. The code should be simplified and clarified to improve readability and reduce the likelihood of errors.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Get the index
    index = data.index

    # Convert clocs from names to level numbers if needed
    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) if i in index.names else i for i in clocs]

    # Unstack the DataFrame
    unstacked = data.unstack(cloc_numbers, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected version, the code is simplified and the logic for converting column names to level numbers if needed is clearly defined. This should address the issues related to the handling of `clocs` and improve the overall functionality of the function.
