The potential bug in the function seems to be with the handling of the `clocs` input when it is part of the `index.names`. The error might be due to incorrect handling of multilevel index columns.

One approach to fix the bug is to check if `clocs` is in `index.names` and then modify the value of `clocs` accordingly, if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check if clocs is in index.names
    for loc in clocs:
        if loc in index.names:
            clocs = [loc]
            break

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code includes the check for `clocs` in `index.names` and modifies `clocs` accordingly based on the result of the check.
