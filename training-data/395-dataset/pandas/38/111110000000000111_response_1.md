The issue seems to be related to unstacking multi-level columns in a DataFrame. The errors suggest that the function `_unstack_multiple` has problems with unstacking operations in multi-level columns.

Looking at the code, it seems that the unstacking logic is not handling multi-level columns properly. The `clocs` variable is used to keep track of the columns to unstack, and it seems to have an issue in the code.

The original code tries to manipulate the `clocs` list and the index levels for unstacking the DataFrame, but this manipulation is causing issues when unstacking. The error messages and sample cases illustrate that the unstacking of multi-level columns is not working as expected.

To fix this, it is necessary to rewrite the logic for unstacking multi-level columns. The unstacking operation should account for the multi-level structure of the columns and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected function for `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):

    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Slicing the columns to unstack
    subset = data[clocs]

    # Unstack the subset of columns
    unstacked = subset.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function simplifies the unstacking operation by directly working with a subset of the columns to unstack and then applying the unstacking operation on that subset. This should address the issues with unstacking multi-level columns in the original code.
