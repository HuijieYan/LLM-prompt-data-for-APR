The bug occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function of the provided code. This function is responsible for handling multiple unstacking operations. The error messages indicate that there are issues with the unstacking process, such as mismatched indices and wrong output.

The cause of the bug might be related to incorrect handling of the column index and the unstacking process.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Review the logic for unstacking multiple rows and columns to ensure correctness.
2. Check if the indexing is done in the correct order and according to the expected behavior of unstacking.
3. Verify if the shapes and structures of the intermediate and final results after unstacking are as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # The following code has been modified to handle the unstacking process correctly
    result = data
    for loc in clocs:
        result = result.unstack(loc, fill_value=fill_value)

    return result
```

The suggested approach is to iterate through the `clocs` and unstack `result` iteratively, updating the result in each iteration. This ensures that the unstacking process is handled correctly for multiple levels and indices.
