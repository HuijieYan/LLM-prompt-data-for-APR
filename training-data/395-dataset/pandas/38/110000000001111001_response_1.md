Potential Error Location:
The error is likely to occur in the section where the unstacked data is being processed and prepared for return.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the unstacked data and the columns when preparing the return value. The code doesn't properly reassign the new columns and index after unstacking, leading to the formation of an incorrectly structured DataFrame.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the unstacked data is processed correctly, and the new columns and index are reassigned properly based on the unstacked result.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same...

    # [Previous code...]
    # ...

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    
    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
