The error message indicates an issue with the `unstack` method in the pandas library, specifically within the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Upon reviewing the `test_unstack_long_index` function, it's apparent that the error is related to the way the levels are handled while unstacking. The error points to a line where the code tries to determine the level number, and it fails because it's not handling MultiIndex correctly.

The reasons behind the bug can be attributed to how the levels are being handled and the usage of MultiIndex. It seems that the function is not appropriately handling MultiIndex operations, resulting in the error.

To fix this bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be modified to correctly handle MultiIndex operations, especially when determining level numbers and unstacking with multiple indices.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check for MultiIndexed index and ensure it is recognized as a whole
    if isinstance(index, pd.MultiIndex):
        clocs = [tuple([c]) if c in index.names else c for c in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected code, I made changes to how MultiIndex is handled, and I ensured that the function correctly identifies the levels and performs unstacking operations.
