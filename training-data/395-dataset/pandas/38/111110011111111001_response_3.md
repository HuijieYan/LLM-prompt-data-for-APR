The error is occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function, particularly in the section where it handles hierarchical columns. The error message suggests that the issue is with the DataFrame indices being different. This indicates that the unstack operation is not correctly reorganizing the index after the unstacking is performed.

The issue seems to stem from how the code is handling the multi-level columns and indices during unstacking. It is failing to handle the indices properly, resulting in different index values when comparing the expected and actual results.

To fix this bug, the unstacking operation and the reorganization of indices after unstacking should be carefully handled, especially in the case of multiple levels.

The corrected function for the `_unstack_multiple` method is as follows:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged
    
    # Correct handling of unstacked indices
    if len(rlocs) == 0:
        unstacked.index = unstacked.index.droplevel()  # Drop one level in case of all indices being in 'clocs'
    else:
        unstacked.index = unstacked.index.droplevel(rlocs)  # Drop the remaining levels

    # Properly reassign the index
    new_index = unstacked.index
    unstacked = unstacked.set_index([new_index[i] for i in range(len(new_index.names))], drop=True)

    return unstacked
```

These modifications aim to correctly handle multi-level indices and avoid the inconsistency in the index values after the unstacking operation. After applying these changes, the function should be more robust and able to handle multi-level indices without causing discrepancies in the results.
