The error occurs because the function `to_native_types` is replacing nan values with 'mynull' instead of 'myn'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
values[mask] = na_rep
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `mask` is filtering out nan values, and then the `na_rep` is mistakenly applied to the remaining values. This is incorrect because the replacement should apply only to nan values.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `mask` to replace only nan values in `values` with the `na_rep`. This can be achieved with the help of the `numpy.where` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `to_native_types` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = isna(values)

    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values = np.where(mask, na_rep, values)
    return values
```

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected and the test case should pass successfully.
