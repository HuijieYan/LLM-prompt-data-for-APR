The error message from the test_to_csv_na_rep_long_string test is indicating that the test is failing because the expected output and the actual output are not matching. It seems that the issue is related to the conversion of "nan" values to "mynull" in the DataFrame when using the to_csv method.

The potential error location within the to_native_types method is in the line:
```python
values[mask] = na_rep
```
This line is intended to replace the NaN values with the specified na_rep value, but it seems that it's not working correctly based on the test failure.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the replacement of NaN values with na_rep is not being performed properly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs in the test case.

To fix the bug, we can directly replace NaN values with na_rep using the replace method of the DataFrame. We can also handle the dtype conversion using the astype method within the to_native_types method.

Here's the corrected code for the to_native_types method:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    df = self
    if slicer is not None:
        df = df.iloc[:, slicer]

    df = df.astype(str).replace('nan', na_rep)
    return df
```

By using the replace method directly on the DataFrame, we can replace "nan" values with the specified na_rep value. This should resolve the bug and make the test_to_csv_na_rep_long_string test pass.
