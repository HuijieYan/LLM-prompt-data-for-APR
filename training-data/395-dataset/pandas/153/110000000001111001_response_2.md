The buggy function `to_native_types` is intended to convert values to a native types format and slice them if desired. It also replaces missing values with a specified value. However, based on the input parameters and expected output, it seems that the function is not converting the values to the correct type when `self.is_object` is False and `quoting` is not provided. Additionally, the `na_rep` value is not being applied correctly.

The bug in the function seems to be related to the condition `if not self.is_object and not quoting:` where the values are being converted to string incorrectly. Additionally, the application of the `na_rep` is not consistent.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the conditional statement to accurately check for `quoting` and apply string conversion.
2. Ensure that the `na_rep` is being applied correctly to the `values` array.
3. Return the correct `values` array after applying the conversion and `na_rep`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = np.isnan(values)

    if not self.is_object and quoting is None:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

With these fixes, the function should now correctly apply string conversion and `na_rep` to the `values` array based on the input parameters.
