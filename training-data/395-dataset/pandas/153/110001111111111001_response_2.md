The problem in the code seems to be with the `values` array assignment. The expected value for the `values` array in the test is `array([['mynull', 'mynull', 'mynull']], dtype='<U3')`, but the actual value is `array([['myn', 'myn', 'myn']], dtype='<U6')`. This causes the assertion error in the test because the values are not matching due to the difference in length and representation.

The bug is occurring because the code is concatenating the `na_rep` string directly to the values, which results in a longer string than expected. This leads to a mismatch with the expected test result and causes the assertion error.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `to_native_types` function to handle the replacement of NA values more appropriately. One approach could be to calculate the maximum length of all potential replacement strings and pad the string with spaces to match that length. Another approach could be to replace the NA values with the `na_rep` string directly without modifying the length of the string.

Here's the corrected `to_native_types` function:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = isna(values)

    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        # Replace NA values with na_rep directly
        values[mask] = na_rep

    return values
```
