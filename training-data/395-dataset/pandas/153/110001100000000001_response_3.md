Potential error location: 
The bug is most likely located in the line `values = self.get_values()` within the `to_native_types` function. This is because the `get_values` function is not defined in the provided code snippet but is being called in the `to_native_types` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `get_values` function is being called within the `to_native_types` function, but there is no implementation for the `get_values` function provided in the code snippet. This is likely causing a NameError or AttributeError when the code is executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If the `get_values` function is supposed to be a part of the class, it should be implemented within the class and then called accordingly.
2. If the `get_values` function is supposed to be a separate function, it should be imported or defined before the `to_native_types` function is called.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_153/pandas/core/internals/blocks.py

import numpy as np  # If not already imported

# relative function's signature in this file
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    # Assuming get_values is a method of the class
    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]

    mask = np.isnan(values)  # Corrected the function name from isna to isnan

    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```
