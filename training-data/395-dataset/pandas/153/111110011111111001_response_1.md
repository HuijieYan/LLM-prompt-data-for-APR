The bug is occurring in the `to_native_types` method of the `Block` class. The bug is causing the `values` to be converted to the wrong string length, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual results of the test.

The reason behind the bug is that when converting values to strings, the wrong string length is being used. This results in a different representation of the string compared to the expected value.

To fix the bug, we should use the correct string length when converting the values to strings. In this case, the string length should be 4 to match the length of the string "mynull".

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = isna(values)

    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype=object)
    
    # Set the correct string length when converting to string
    values[mask] = na_rep.ljust(values.shape[0])  # use the length of the na_rep string
    return values
```

With this fix, the `values` are correctly converted to strings of the expected length and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
