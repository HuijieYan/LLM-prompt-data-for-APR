The bug occurs in the `to_native_types` function. The issue is with the line where the `values` array is being initialized based on certain conditions and operations.

The bug occurs because when the `values` array is being assigned the value 'mynull', the length of the strings is being truncated to the length of the string 'myn'. This might be due to the assumption of a fixed length for the strings.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `values` array is initialized with the correct length for the strings when assigning the na_rep value.

Additionally, it's important to note that in the test function, the expected value of `values` array is `array([['myn', 'myn', 'myn']], dtype='<U3')`, indicating that the maximum length of the string is 3. This aligns with the expected value of the `values` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_native_types` function:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """
    
    values = self.get_values()
    
    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
        
    mask = isna(values)
    
    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        # Ensure values array is of type str
        values = values.astype('<U' + str(len(na_rep)))
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

With this corrected code, the `values` array will be correctly initialized with the appropriate length for the strings, ensuring that the na_rep value is not truncated. This fix should address the issue reported in the test function and GitHub issue.
