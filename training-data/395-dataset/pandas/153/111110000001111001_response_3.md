The buggy function `to_native_types` is intended to convert values to a native types format. However, the bug is likely to be in the line `values = values.astype(str)` and `values = np.array(values, dtype="object")` as these lines are trying to convert the values to a string or object datatype, but the input values are already strings.

The bug occurred because the function unnecessarily tries to convert the values to string or object datatype even though they are already strings. This unnecessary conversion results in incorrect behavior and can potentially cause issues in the rest of the code.

To fix the bug, simply remove the unnecessary type conversion lines and directly set the `na_rep` for the masked values.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = isna(values)

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```
