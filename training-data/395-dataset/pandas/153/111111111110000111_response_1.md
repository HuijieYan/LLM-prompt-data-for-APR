The error seems to be occurring in the 'to_native_types' method, which is called by the 'to_csv' method. The test case is attempting to convert a DataFrame with 'Int64' dtype to CSV format with a specified 'na_rep' as 'mynull'. However, the resulting CSV output does not match the expected output. This indicates that the 'na_rep' parameter is not being respected when converting the specified dtype to CSV format.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'to_native_types' method where the 'na_rep' parameter may not be handled correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug might be that the 'to_native_types' method is not correctly handling the conversion of 'Int64' dtype and the application of 'na_rep' during the CSV conversion.

To fix the bug, the 'to_native_types' method should be modified to correctly handle the 'na_rep' parameter when converting the specified 'Int64' dtype to CSV format.

Here's the corrected code for the 'to_native_types' method:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """
    mask = isna(self)
    
    if not quoting and not self.is_object:
        values = self.values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(self.values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]

    return values
```

In the corrected method, the 'isna' function is used to create a mask for the NaN values. Then, the 'self' values are converted to the appropriate type and the 'na_rep' is applied to the masked values. Finally, if a slicer is provided, the values are sliced accordingly.

With these changes, the 'to_native_types' method should correctly handle the 'Int64' dtype and respect the 'na_rep' parameter during CSV conversion.
