The error occurs when the test_to_csv_na_rep_long_string function is executed. The test case creates a DataFrame with "Int64" type and sets the na_rep to "mynull". The expected output is a CSV string with "mynull" in place of NaN values. However, the actual output is truncated, and "myn" is used instead of "mynull".

The potential error location within the to_native_types function is the conversion of values to a string when the dtype is not object and quoting is not specified. The bug occurs because the conversion to a string is not properly handling the "Int64" type values.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the "Int64" type specifically and ensure that the na_rep value is respected for all column types. We can achieve this by modifying the conversion logic for non-object types and ensuring that the na_rep value is correctly applied.

Here's the corrected code for the to_native_types function:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = isna(values)

    if not (self.is_object or self.is_extension_type):
        if self.dtype == "Int64":
            values = values.astype("float").astype("str")
        else:
            values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

In the corrected code, we handle the "Int64" type specifically by first converting it to float and then to a string. For other non-object types, we continue to convert them directly to a string. This approach ensures that the na_rep value is respected for all column types, including "Int64".
