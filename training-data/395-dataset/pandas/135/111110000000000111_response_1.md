The error is occurring in the `agg_series` function of the `BaseGrouper` class. The bug is likely caused by changes in the code that affected the behavior of `self._aggregate_series_fast` when the series is backed by an ExtensionArray. This results in an "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" error.

To fix this bug, the `agg_series` function needs to handle ExtensionArrays properly and ensure that the AttributeError is caught and handled. To do this, we can modify the `agg_series` function as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError as e:
        # Handle AttributeError for ExtensionArray
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
```
