The issue arises from the `agg_series` method not properly handling the aggregation of DecimalArray. It seems that the changes made in the PR #29088 are causing a bug as the method `_aggregate_series_fast` results in an AttributeError when trying to aggregate DecimalArray, but this error is not being caught.

To fix this issue, the `try-except` block should be modified to catch the AttributeError as well. The corrected code for the `agg_series` method is as follows:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, AttributeError):
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

With this modification, the method now catches the AttributeError and handles it the same way as an AssertionError. This should resolve the issue with aggregating DecimalArray.
