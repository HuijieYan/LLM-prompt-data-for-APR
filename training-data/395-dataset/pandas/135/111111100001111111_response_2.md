The bug seems to be caused by the change in the `agg_series` function due to the modification of the `self._aggregate_series_fast` method. The error message "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" indicates that the `DecimalArray` object does not have the 'flags' attribute, which is being accessed in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method.

To fix the bug, the `_aggregate_series_fast` method should be modified to handle the case when the series is backed by a `DecimalArray` object. It should not access the 'flags' attribute directly, or it should handle the AttributeError and fall back to the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        # Handle AttributeError and fall back to _aggregate_series_pure_python method
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
```
