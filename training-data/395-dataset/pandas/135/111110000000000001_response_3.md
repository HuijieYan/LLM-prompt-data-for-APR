The potential error in the `agg_series` function is the use of `return` after the `raise` statement, which makes the code unreachable. This means that the function will always return the result of `_aggregate_series_pure_python` even if an exception is raised.

To fix this issue, we can remove the unnecessary `return` statement after the `raise` statement and also remove the redundant `except AssertionError` block, as it does not serve any purpose.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
        try:
            return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        except ValueError as err:
            if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                # raised in libreduction
                pass
            else:
                raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
