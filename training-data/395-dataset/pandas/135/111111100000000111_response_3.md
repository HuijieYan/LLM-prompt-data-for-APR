The issue seems to be related to the change in behavior of the `agg_series` method in the `BaseGrouper` class, specifically due to the change in the behavior of `self._aggregate_series_fast` method. 

The error message "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" indicates that the `DecimalArray` object does not have an attribute called `flags`, which is being accessed by the `_aggregate_series_fast` method. 

This error occurs because the logic of accessing the `flags` attribute in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method is not compatible with the `DecimalArray` object, leading to the AttributeError. 

One possible approach to fix this bug is to check if the `DecimalArray` object has the `flags` attribute before accessing it inside the `_aggregate_series_fast` method. If it does not have the `flags` attribute, then the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method can be used instead.

Here is the corrected code for the `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        # If the _aggregate_series_fast method throws an AttributeError
        # then use the _aggregate_series_pure_python method
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except (ValueError, AssertionError) as err:
        # Handle specific ValueErrors and AssertionErrors
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            pass
        else:
            raise
        # If the error does not match the specific cases, use _aggregate_series_pure_python method
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
