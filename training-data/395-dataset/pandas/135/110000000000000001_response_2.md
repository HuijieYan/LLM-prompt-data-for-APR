Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is that the `except` block is structured in a way that will always execute the last `return` statement, regardless of the error type. This means that the `self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)` call will always be executed, which may not be desired behavior.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `except` block should only execute the last `return` statement if specific types of `ValueError` are encountered. However, the current code does not handle this properly, and as a result, the wrong path is always taken.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to restructure the `except` block so that the correct `return` statement is executed based on the type of `ValueError` encountered. We can use `isinstance` to check the type of the error before deciding which `return` statement to execute.

Corrected Code:
```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
