Potential error location: The error seems to occur in the function `_aggregate_series_fast` when it tries to access the `flags` attribute of the `DecimalArray` object.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be caused by a recent change in the `agg_series` function, specifically in the `self._aggregate_series_fast` method. This change leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `flags` attribute of the `DecimalArray` object, as it does not have this attribute.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `DecimalArray` object has the `flags` attribute before accessing it in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method.
2. If the `DecimalArray` object does not have the `flags` attribute, handle this case accordingly (e.g., by using a different approach or method).

Corrected code:
```python
# corrected agg_series function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        # handle the case where DecimalArray does not have the flags attribute
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
