The error is occurring because the DataFrame `df` has a column called "decimals" with a data type of DecimalArray. When using the `agg` method on this column, it is expected that the result should have a dtype of decimal. However, the buggy function is not inferring the correct data type, causing the test to fail.

The error is likely occurring in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method, where it is not properly handling the DecimalArray data type.

To fix this bug, the `_aggregate_series_fast` method needs to be modified to handle DecimalArray data type and return the correct data type for the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if isinstance(result, DecimalArray):
            # If the result is a DecimalArray, return its values
            return result.values
        else:
            return result
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

In the corrected code, after calling `_aggregate_series_fast`, it checks if the result is a DecimalArray. If it is, it returns the values of the DecimalArray. If not, it returns the result as is. If an error is raised, it checks for specific error messages and falls back to `_aggregate_series_pure_python` if necessary.
