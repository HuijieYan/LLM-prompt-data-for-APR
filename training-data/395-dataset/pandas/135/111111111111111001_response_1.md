The error message reported in the test function indicates that the dtype of the Series objects obtained after aggregation is not being inferred as decimal, which is expected.

Looking at the function 'agg_series' in the provided code, it seems there is a problem with the exception handling when calling the '_aggregate_series_fast' function and there are no specific clauses to handle the errors related to the dtype of the result.

The bug occurs because when an error related to the dtype (specifically with decimal) is encountered in 'agg_series' function, it falls back to '_aggregate_series_pure_python', which does not handle the dtype inference.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the dtype inference explicitly when calling '_aggregate_series_fast' or when falling back to '_aggregate_series_pure_python' based on a specific error.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function 'agg_series':

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if not pd.api.types.is_list_like(result) or not all(isinstance(x, decimal) for x in result):
            result = self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        return result
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            result = self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
            return result
        else:
            raise
```

In the corrected code, after getting the result from '_aggregate_series_fast' and if the dtype is not inferred as expected, it falls back to '_aggregate_series_pure_python'. The error handling logic for specific ValueError conditions is also updated to trigger the fallback based on the error message.
