The error message indicates that the `dtype` attribute of the Series is expected to be 'decimal' but it is 'object' instead. This suggests that there might be an issue with inferring the dtype of the result of the aggregation operation.

The problematic function is the `agg_series` method in the `BaseGrouper` class. The issue seems to be related to the `_aggregate_series_fast` function, where it might be failing to properly handle the inference of the dtype when operating on DecimalArray.

The bug seems to be caused by a recent change in the implementation of `agg_series` and its related functions. The change in `agg_series` (specifically the `_aggregate_series_fast` function) does not handle DecimalArray objects correctly, leading to an incorrect inference of the dtype for the result of the aggregation operation.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `agg_series` method to properly handle DecimalArray objects and ensure that the dtype is inferred correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if not hasattr(result, 'dtype'):
            result = self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            result = self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
    return result
```

This updated function first attempts to use `_aggregate_series_fast` to perform the aggregation. If the result does not have a `dtype` attribute, it falls back to using `_aggregate_series_pure_python` to handle the aggregation for DecimalArray objects. Additionally, it catches both `AssertionError` and `ValueError` to handle different scenarios where the fast aggregation may fail.

This should address the issue with the incorrect inference of dtype and resolve the bug related to DecimalArray aggregation.
