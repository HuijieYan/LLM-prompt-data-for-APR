The buggy function `agg_series` seems to be trying to perform aggregation on a series `obj` using a specific function `func`. If the aggregation fails, it falls back to pure Python-based aggregation.

The function `agg_series` is encountering an issue when trying to handle `ValueError` exceptions. In the `except ValueError as err` block, when checking for specific error messages, it's trying to handle cases by comparing the error message using `str(err)`. However, the error message might not always match exactly due to differences in floating-point representations of decimals.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `except ValueError` block to handle specific conditions separately without relying on exact error message matching. We can also add a generic `except` block to catch other `ValueError` exceptions.

Here's the corrected `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # Handle specific conditions separately
            pass
        else:
            raise
    except:
        # Handle other ValueErrors
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In the corrected function, we handle specific conditions based on known error messages without relying on exact error message matching. We also incorporate a generic `except` block to catch other `ValueError` exceptions.
