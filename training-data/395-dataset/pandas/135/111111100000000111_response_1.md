Analysis:
The test case involves using a DecimalArray for grouping in a DataFrame and then applying an aggregation function to it. It has been identified that a recent change in the agg_series method is causing an AttributeError when the series is backed by an EA (ExtensionArray).

Identifying the potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the agg_series method, specifically in the call to the _aggregate_series_fast method.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
The recent change in the agg_series method is causing an AttributeError when the series is backed by an ExtensionArray. This means that the _aggregate_series_fast method is not handling ExtensionArray objects properly, resulting in the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handle ExtensionArray objects properly within the _aggregate_series_fast method.
2. Make necessary modifications to ensure that ExtensionArray objects are supported within the agg_series method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected agg_series method
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
In the corrected code, the method first attempts to use _aggregate_series_fast and handles the AttributeError by falling back to _aggregate_series_pure_python if necessary. This approach ensures that ExtensionArray objects are properly handled within the agg_series method.
