The `agg_series` function contains a try-except block and two function calls: `_aggregate_series_fast` and `_aggregate_series_pure_python`. The `agg_series` function is meant to call the `_aggregate_series_fast` method and handle specific exceptions. However, the current implementation is not returning any value if an exception is caught, leading to incorrect behavior.

Given the context, the bug is likely occurring because the `except` block does not explicitly return a value, leading to a None return value in certain situations.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the correct series aggregation method is called and that a value is returned if any exception is caught.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

In this corrected implementation, the `except` block now explicitly returns a value based on the exceptions caught. This ensures that the correct series aggregation method is called and that a value is returned under all circumstances, fixing the bug.
