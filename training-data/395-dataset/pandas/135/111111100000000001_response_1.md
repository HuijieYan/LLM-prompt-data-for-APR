The potential error location within the function is the return statement after the exception handling. The code currently returns `self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)` after handling the exceptions, but it also includes a `return` statement after raising the exceptions.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to return a value after raising an exception. When an exception is raised, the control flow immediately exits the function, and the subsequent `return` statement is not reached.

To fix the bug, the `return` statement after raising the exceptions should be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
