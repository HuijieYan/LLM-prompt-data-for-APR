The error occurs in the `agg_series` function when `self._aggregate_series_fast` raises an `AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'`. This error is not being caught, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug is occurring because of a recent change in the `agg_series` function, specifically in the handling of `_aggregate_series_fast`. The change in this function is causing the `AttributeError` to not be caught, leading to the unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `agg_series` function needs to be modified to handle the `AttributeError` properly. The `except AttributeError` block should be added to catch this specific error and handle it appropriately, possibly by falling back to `_aggregate_series_pure_python` if the error occurs.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        # handle the AttributeError here
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
