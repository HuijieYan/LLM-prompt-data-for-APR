The code provided uses a try-except block in the `agg_series` method of the `BaseGrouper` class. If an `AssertionError` is raised, it is re-raised, but if a `ValueError` is raised with specific messages, it is "silenced" and the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method is called. However, the code mistakenly attempts to return the result of `_aggregate_series_pure_python` within the `except` block, i.e., if a `ValueError` is not raised.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In this correction, the return statement for `_aggregate_series_pure_python` has been moved outside of the `except` block, ensuring that it is only executed if a `ValueError` is raised with the specific messages suggesting that it should be used.
