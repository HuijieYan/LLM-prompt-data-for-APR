The bug is likely occurring in the `_aggregate_series_fast` function or in the exception handling of the `agg_series` function. The error message indicates a discrepancy in the "dtype" attribute of the Series objects.

The issue seems to be related to changes made in the `agg_series` method due to the introduction of ExtensionArray. When the `self._aggregate_series_fast` is called with DecimalArray, it raises an "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" error, which is not caught in the exception handling.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `DecimalArray` objects are handled correctly in the `agg_series` method.

Here's the corrected `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

The changes made include:
1. Catching both `AssertionError` and `ValueError` exceptions together.
2. Checking for the specific error messages "No result." and "Function does not reduce" to handle those cases.
3. If the error messages do not match the handled cases, a generic catch-all `except` block will re-raise the exception so that other errors are not silently ignored.

With these changes, the `agg_series` method should handle `DecimalArray` objects correctly and address the bug that causes the "AttributeError" to be unhandled.

It's also important to review the behavior of `_aggregate_series_fast` and ensure that it's capable of handling DecimalArray objects, or introduce a separate processing path for ExtensionArray types.
