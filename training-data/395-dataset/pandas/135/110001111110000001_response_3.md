The first test case is trying to group by "id1" and then apply the aggregation function `lambda x: x.iloc[0]`. The expected result is a series with decimal dtype but the error message shows that the dtype of the result is an object, not a decimal.

The second test case is similar, using a custom method `my_sum` to aggregate the group.

The issue likely resides in the `agg_series` function. Without the full context of the code, it's difficult to identify the exact location of the bug.

The issue could be related to the aggregation function not properly inferring the result dtype when using custom aggregation methods. It is possible that the `_aggregate_series_fast` function does not properly handle the inference of combined dtypes in certain scenarios, leading to the incorrect dtype in the result.

To fix the bug, one potential approach would be to modify the `_aggregate_series_fast` method to ensure that the dtype inference is correctly handled for custom aggregation methods that return decimal dtype. Additionally, ensuring that the `agg_series` method accounts for custom aggregation methods and properly specifies the result dtype could also help resolve the issue.

Below is the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if isinstance(result, pd.Series) and result.dtype.name == 'object':
            raise ValueError("Function does not reduce")
        return result
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

This modified function first tries to use the fast aggregation method, and then checks if the result is a Series with dtype 'object'. If so, it raises a ValueError indicating that the function does not reduce. This handles the scenario described in the test case where the result dtype is incorrect. If the fast aggregation method fails for other reasons, it falls back to using the pure Python aggregation method.
