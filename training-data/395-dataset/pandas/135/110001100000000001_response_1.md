Potential error location: The error can occur in the try block when calling the `_aggregate_series_fast` function, and also within the except block when handling the ValueError.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The except block has a return statement after raising an exception, which means that the code in the except block never gets executed. 
2. The handling of the exceptions is not clear, and it's not raising a specific exception for custom handling.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the return statement from the except block to ensure that the code within the block gets executed.
2. Add specific exception handling for different error messages to provide clearer error handling.

Corrected code:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown ValueError occurred: " + str(err))
            
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
