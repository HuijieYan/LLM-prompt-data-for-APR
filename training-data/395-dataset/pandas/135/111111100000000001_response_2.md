The bug in the `agg_series` function is that it catches specific exceptions (AssertionError and ValueError) and re-raises them without providing any helpful information. This can make it difficult to understand the root cause of the error.

To fix this bug, we should:
- Remove the try-except block and let any exceptions propagate to the caller.
- Instead of catching specific exceptions, we can catch the `Exception` class and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
```
