The error message from the test function indicates that the returned Series has a dtype of 'object' instead of 'decimal'. This discrepancy is likely a result of an issue in the `agg_series` function.

The bug is most likely occurring in the `_aggregate_series_fast` function. When the `self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)` call is made, it might be encountering an error such as "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'". This error is not being handled properly in the `agg_series` function, leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the test function.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle the potential AttributeError that occurs when `_aggregate_series_fast` is called. If the error is related to the 'flags' attribute not being present in the 'DecimalArray' object, it should be caught and the method `_aggregate_series_pure_python` should be called instead.

Here is the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError as err:
        if 'flags' in str(err):
            # handle AttributeError related to 'flags' attribute
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

By catching the AttributeError related to the 'flags' attribute and handling it appropriately, the `agg_series` function should now be able to handle the `DecimalArray` object and return the expected 'decimal' dtype when used in the test function.
