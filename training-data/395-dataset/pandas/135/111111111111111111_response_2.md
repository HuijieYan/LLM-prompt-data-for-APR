The error occurs when the `_aggregate_series_fast` method encounters a `DecimalArray` object. This causes the method to give an "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" error. The changes introduced in PR #29088 are responsible for this, as they no longer catch this AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `_aggregate_series_fast` method should be updated to handle `DecimalArray` objects properly. It should be modified to handle any attributes or specific behavior of `DecimalArray` objects that may differ from regular series objects.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        # Handle specific behavior of DecimalArray with appropriate code
        pass
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In this corrected code, the specific behavior of `DecimalArray` objects can be handled within the `agg_series` method. This allows for proper handling when encountering `DecimalArray` objects, and avoids the AttributeError that was occurring.
