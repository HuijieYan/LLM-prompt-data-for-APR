The bug occurs in the function `agg_series`. The function is attempting to call `_aggregate_series_fast` and if an `AssertionError` or `ValueError` is raised, it attempts to handle it but still calls `_aggregate_series_pure_python` in any case.

The bug occurs when the `obj` parameter is a Series backed by `DecimalArray`, resulting in an AttributeError. This is due to the change made in the `agg_series` function as part of PR #29088.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the AttributeError specifically and ensure that the correct handling is performed for the case when the series is backed by a `DecimalArray`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
    except AttributeError as err:
        # Handle AttributeError specifically when the series is backed by DecimalArray
        # Perform necessary handling for this case
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In this corrected code, we handle the AttributeError specifically and ensure that the correct handling is performed when the series is backed by a `DecimalArray`. This should resolve the bug related to the regression on master in groupby agg with ExtensionArray.
