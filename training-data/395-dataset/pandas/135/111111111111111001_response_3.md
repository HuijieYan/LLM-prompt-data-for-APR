The error message indicates that the dtype attribute of the Series returned by the agg function is different from the expected dtype. This suggests that the aggregation function in the BaseGrouper class is not correctly inferring the dtype of the result.

The buggy function `agg_series` within the `BaseGrouper` class uses a try-except block to call `_aggregate_series_fast` method and handles exceptions. However, the bug might be related to this exception handling logic, as it seems that the dtype inference or result type handling might not be happening as expected in the `_aggregate_series_fast` function or the exception handling logic.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that `agg_series` returns the result with the correct dtype. It might require modifications to the implementation of `_aggregate_series_fast` to handle dtype inference and result type correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class BaseGrouper():
    # ... (other code) ...

    def _aggregate_series_fast(self, obj, func):
        # ... omitted code ...
        # Correct implementation to ensure the dtype is preserved
        return obj.agg(func)

    def agg_series(self, obj, func):
        try:
            return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        except ValueError as err:
            if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
            else:
                raise
```

In the above correction, `_aggregate_series_fast` is modified to ensure that the dtype is preserved when applying the aggregation function. The `agg_series` method now directly calls `_aggregate_series_fast` and handles exceptions. If the exceptions contain specific error messages, it falls back to `_aggregate_series_pure_python`, but otherwise, it raises the exception.

This correction ensures that the dtype inference and result type are handled correctly in the aggregation process.
