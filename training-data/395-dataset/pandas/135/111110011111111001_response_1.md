The error message indicates that the `agg_series` function is not inferring the decimal data type correctly, resulting in the test failures.

The issue seems to be with the `agg_series` method failing to handle Decimal data type properly. Decimal type is a custom data type, and the `agg_series` method should be modified to handle Decimal data type.

Instead of using the `try-except` block to catch specific errors and handle them, it is better to perform proper type checking and handle Decimal data type separately. Additionally, the `_aggregate_series_fast` function might not be handling Decimal data type correctly, causing the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    if isinstance(obj, DecimalSeries):
        # Handle Decimal data type separately
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except Exception as err:
        # Catch any other exceptions and re-raise
        raise
```

By handling the Decimal data type separately in the `agg_series` method, we can ensure that it is processed correctly.

Similarly, the `_aggregate_series_fast` function should be modified to handle Decimal data type properly.

By making these changes, the `agg_series` function should be able to handle various data types, including Decimal, and the test cases should pass without errors.
