The test cases are checking for the inference of the result of `agg` to be of decimal dtype. The bug seems to be in the `agg_series` method, as indicated by the assertion error when the test function `test_groupby_agg` is run.

The bug seems to be occurring because the method `agg_series` is not handling the conversion to decimal dtype correctly.

To fix the bug, the `agg_series` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the conversion to decimal dtype. This can be done by ensuring that the result infer to the decimal dtype.

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if not result.dtype == "decimal":
            raise ValueError("No result.")
        return result
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        raise
```

In the modified function, after getting the result from `_aggregate_series_fast`, we check if the dtype is not "decimal" and raise a ValueError with the message "No result." if it's not. Then we handle this specific ValueError in the error handling section to call the alternative processing in `self._aggregate_series_pure_python` to ensure the inference to the decimal dtype.

With this modification, the `agg_series` method should correctly handle the inference to the decimal dtype and fix the bug.
