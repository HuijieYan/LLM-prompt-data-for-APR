Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the `self._aggregate_series_fast` function when the series is backed by an ExtensionArray (EA).

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be caused by a recent change in the `agg_series` function, specifically in the `_aggregate_series_fast` function. The error message "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" indicates that the ExtensionArray object is causing the issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the object is backed by an ExtensionArray before calling the `_aggregate_series_fast` function, and handle it accordingly.
2. Modify the `_aggregate_series_fast` function to handle ExtensionArray objects properly.
3. Add specific error handling for ExtensionArray objects within the `agg_series` function to catch and handle the AttributeError properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
        if hasattr(obj, 'flags') and 'C_CONTIGUOUS' in obj.flags and 'F_CONTIGUOUS' in obj.flags:
            # ExtensionArray specific handling
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        try:
            return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        except AssertionError:
            raise
        except ValueError as err:
            if "No result." in str(err):
                # raised in libreduction
                pass
            elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                # raised in libreduction
                pass
            else:
                raise
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
