The buggy function `agg_series` is currently handling exceptions and error messages related to aggregation. However, there are several issues to address:

1. The `except` block is used to catch specific errors and then doesn't re-raise them. Instead, it simply logs the error and falls back to `_aggregate_series_pure_python`. This is counterintuitive and doesn't provide the necessary feedback about the specific error that occurred.

2. The comments in the code don't quite align with the actions being taken in the `except` block, potentially confusing future developers or maintainers of the code.

3. The error handling looks incomplete and might miss some potential errors.

To fix this, we can remove the specific exception handling logic and replace it with a more straightforward and general catching mechanism. By doing this, we ensure that any unhandled exceptions are still communicated and not simply ignored. 

Also, the comments should be revised to reflect the actual error handling logic performed in the function.

Below is the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except Exception as e:
        if "No result." in str(e) or "Function does not reduce" in str(e):
            pass  # raised in libreduction
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
