The error messages from the test functions indicate that there is an issue with inferring the data type as decimal. It seems that the problem is occurring when trying to compare the inferred data type with the expected data type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_aggregate_series_fast` method. It seems that the `agg_series` method may not be correctly handling the data types.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the methods used for aggregation not maintaining the data type integrity.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the aggregation methods correctly handle the data type. This might involve modifying the `agg_series` method to handle the data type correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if isinstance(result, pd.Series) and result.dtype == "decimal":
            return result
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In the corrected code, after attempting to use the fast aggregation method, it checks whether the result is a pandas Series and if its dtype is "decimal." If so, it returns the result. Otherwise, it falls back to using the pure Python implementation for aggregation.
