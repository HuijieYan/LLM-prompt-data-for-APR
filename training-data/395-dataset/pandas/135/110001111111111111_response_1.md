The error message indicates that the dtype of the Series is different than expected. This is likely due to the buggy function `agg_series` returning an object dtype instead of a decimal dtype. The error occurs during the `agg` operation on a grouped DataFrame or Series.

The bug likely occurs in the `agg_series` function where the `_aggregate_series_fast` method is not handling the DecimalArray object properly, and as a result, the dtype of the Series is not inferred correctly.

To fix the bug, the handling of DecimalArray objects within the `_aggregate_series_fast` method should be improved to ensure that the dtype is inferred correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if result.dtype == 'object':
            result = DecimalArray(result)
        return result
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

In this corrected code, after obtaining the result from `_aggregate_series_fast`, it checks if the dtype is 'object'. If so, it converts the result to a DecimalArray. This will ensure that the dtype is correctly inferred as decimal instead of object.
