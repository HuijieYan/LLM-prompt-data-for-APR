Potential Error Location: 
The potential error lies in the `except` block of the `agg_series` function where it catches `ValueError` and checks for specific error messages. The code then returns `self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)` regardless of the error type.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code within the `except` block is not handling the specific errors in a meaningful way. Instead, it catches all `ValueError` instances and returns the result from `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the specific error message in the `ValueError` exception and handle each case appropriately.
2. Rethrow the error if it is not one of the expected error messages.
3. Consider handling other exceptions separately if they are relevant to the context.

Corrected Code:
```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
