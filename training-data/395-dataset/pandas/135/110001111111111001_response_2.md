The error seems to be related to the return type of the `agg_series` function. The error message indicates that the dtype of the returned series is different from what is expected by the test.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `agg_series` function is expected to return a decimal dtype, but it might be returning an object dtype instead. This discrepancy in dtype causes the assertion error in the test.

The bug is likely occurring because the `agg_series` function is not correctly handling the data type conversion to decimal.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `agg_series` function correctly handles the data type conversion to decimal and returns the series with the expected decimal dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        # Convert the result to decimal dtype if needed
        if not pd.api.types.is_decimal_dtype(result):
            result = result.astype("decimal")
        return result
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func).astype("decimal")
        else:
            raise
```

In this corrected code, after obtaining the result using `_aggregate_series_fast`, we check if the dtype is a decimal dtype. If not, we convert the result to decimal using `.astype("decimal")`. If an exception is caught due to "No result." or "Function does not reduce", then we handle those exceptions by returning the result from `_aggregate_series_pure_python` with the dtype converted to decimal.

With this correction, the `agg_series` function should now correctly handle the data type conversion and return the series with the expected decimal dtype, resolving the dtype mismatch issue observed in the test.
