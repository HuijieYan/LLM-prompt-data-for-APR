The bug in the provided function `agg_series` is likely causing the returned series to have the wrong dtype in some cases, as evident from the error messages. This is likely due to the failed catch of specific exceptions or due to execution of the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method, which could lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the exceptions are handled properly and that the correct method is called based on the type of exception. It's also important to ensure that the correct types are being used while calling the methods.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            pass  # no action is required
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In this corrected function, the `try` block handles the `AssertionError` while the `except` block handles the `ValueError`. Inside the `except` block, there's a conditional check for specific error messages to determine whether to raise the error or not. If the error messages match, it simply passes. Otherwise, it raises the exception. Finally, the function returns the result of `_aggregate_series_pure_python` in case an exception occurs.

This change should address the issues identified in the tests and should make the function more robust.
