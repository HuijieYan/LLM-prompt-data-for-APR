The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of exceptions. The bug occurs because the function `agg_series` does not handle all possible exceptions properly. It tries to catch `ValueError` exceptions with specific messages, but it does not account for other `ValueError` exceptions. 

To fix this bug, the function should have a more generic exception handling for `ValueError` and raise an error for any other type of exception. 

Here is the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

The corrected function now properly handles all `ValueError` exceptions.
