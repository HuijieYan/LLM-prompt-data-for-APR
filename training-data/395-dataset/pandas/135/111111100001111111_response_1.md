Error analysis:
The error is occurring in the `_aggregate_series_fast` function when the series is backed by an EA (ExtensionArray). The error message is "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'". This error is not being caught and handled properly in the try-except block in the `agg_series` function.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is caused by changes in the `agg_series` function, specifically in the handling of EA-backed series. The error is not being caught properly, leading to the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the type of the 'obj' parameter in the `agg_series` function and handle ExtensionArray differently.
2. Add specific error handling for ExtensionArray-backed series in the try-except block.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, AttributeError):
        try:
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        except ValueError as err:
            if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                pass
            else:
                raise
        except AttributeError:
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
