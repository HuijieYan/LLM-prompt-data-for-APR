    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _aggregate_series_pure_python(self, obj, func):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# the correct function after fixing the error
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except Exception as e:
        if "No result." in str(e) or "Function does not reduce" in str(e):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        raise
```
The function has been corrected to handle the exceptions more efficiently and return the result after catching the exception. The exceptions are handled and specific error messages are checked to decide when to use the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` function.
