The error message from the test function indicates that the dtype of the result is different from the expected dtype. This indicates a problem with the aggregation operation, specifically in inferring the correct dtype for the aggregated result.

The potential error location is within the `agg_series` method of the `BaseGrouper` class. The method attempts to use `_aggregate_series_fast` for aggregation, and if an AssertionError or ValueError is encountered, it falls back to using `_aggregate_series_pure_python`. This fallback mechanism does not handle the dtype inference correctly, resulting in the dtype discrepancy observed in the error message.

The bug is caused by the change in the behavior of `_aggregate_series_fast` when dealing with Series that are backed by ExtensionArrays. Prior to the change, the error was caught and handled within `_aggregate_series_fast`. However, after the change, the AttributeError is no longer caught, leading to an exception and incorrect dtype inference.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the `agg_series` method to handle the dtype inference correctly. Specifically, we should ensure that the dtype inference is consistent regardless of whether `_aggregate_series_fast` or `_aggregate_series_pure_python` is used.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
            result = result.astype('object')  # Ensure the resulting dtype is object
        return result
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

In the corrected code, we handle the dtype inference after calling `_aggregate_series_fast`. We check if the result is a Series and then explicitly convert its dtype to 'object' to ensure consistency with the previous behavior. This should resolve the dtype discrepancy issue observed in the error messages.
