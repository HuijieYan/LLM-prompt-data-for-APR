1. The test case provided shows an example where the `groupby` and `agg` operations return unexpected results on the master branch compared to a few days ago. The error seems to be related to changes in the `agg_series` function and specifically the `self._aggregate_series_fast` method.

2. The potential error location within the `agg_series` function could be the lack of proper exception handling for the AttributeError when calling `self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)`.

3. The bug seems to be caused by changes in the `agg_series` function, specifically in the handling of ExtensionArray (EA) objects. The AttributeError indicates that the EA object does not have an attribute 'flags', which was previously not being properly handled.

4. A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to modify the exception handling in the `agg_series` function to also handle the AttributeError and provide a fallback to `_aggregate_series_pure_python` when an EA object is encountered. This would involve checking the type of the input `obj` and handling ExtensionArray objects differently.

5. Corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, AttributeError) as err:
        if isinstance(obj, pd.api.extensions.ExtensionArray):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the type of `obj` and if it is an ExtensionArray, we handle the AttributeError by falling back to `_aggregate_series_pure_python`. Additionally, we added handling for the AttributeError within the main exception block. If an AttributeError occurs, and the input `obj` is an ExtensionArray, we also fall back to the pure Python method.
