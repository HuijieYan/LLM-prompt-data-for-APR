The error message indicates that the dtype of the Series is different from what is expected. This suggests that the issue might be related to the datatype of the Series not being inferred correctly when using the agg function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'agg_series' method in the 'BaseGrouper' class. The method should correctly handle the aggregation of series objects to ensure that the datatype is inferred correctly.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the 'agg_series' method is not handling the aggregation of series objects properly, leading to incorrect dtype inference.

To fix the bug, the 'agg_series' method should be modified to ensure that the aggregation of series objects is handled appropriately to infer the correct datatype. This might involve updating the logic for handling the aggregation and datatype inference for series objects.

Here's the corrected code for the 'agg_series' method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            result = self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
    return result
```

In this corrected code, the 'agg_series' method attempts to use the fast aggregation method '_aggregate_series_fast' and falls back to the pure Python method '_aggregate_series_pure_python' if any AssertionError or ValueError related to reduction occurs. This change ensures that the aggregation of series objects is handled properly, allowing the dtype to be inferred correctly.
