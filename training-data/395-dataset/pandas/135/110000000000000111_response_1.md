Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring when the `self._aggregate_series_fast` function is called with the 'DecimalArray' object, which results in the AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to changes in the implementation of the `agg_series` function, specifically related to the change in `self._aggregate_series_fast`. The method seems to be expecting certain attributes that are not present in the 'DecimalArray' object, leading to the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the implementation of `self._aggregate_series_fast` to handle the 'DecimalArray' object appropriately.
2. Add a conditional check in the `agg_series` function to use a different approach when dealing with 'DecimalArray' objects, rather than calling `self._aggregate_series_fast`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError as err:
        if "DecimalArray' object" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
