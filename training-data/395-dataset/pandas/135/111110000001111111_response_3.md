The bug seems to occur in the `_aggregate_series_fast` function where an `AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'` is raised if the series is backed by an ExtensionArray. This error is no longer caught due to changes in the `agg_series` method in the BaseGrouper class.

To fix this bug, the except block for `AssertionError` should be modified to also catch `AttributeError`, and the appropriate action should be taken to handle this error. It seems that if the `agg_series` method encounters an AttributeError, it should fall back to the pure Python implementation `_aggregate_series_pure_python`.

Here's the corrected `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, AttributeError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

With this modification, when an AttributeError is raised in `_aggregate_series_fast`, it will be caught and handled appropriately by falling back to `_aggregate_series_pure_python`.
