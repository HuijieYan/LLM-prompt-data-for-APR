The error in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of decimal values in the dataframe and the aggregation methods. The bug is causing the incorrectly inferred dtype from the aggregation results as it should be a decimal while the buggy function results in an object dtype. This is causing the assertion error in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the results of the aggregation reflect the correct dtype, which should be decimal.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if isinstance(result, pd.Series) and result.dtype == object:
            result = result.astype("decimal")
        return result
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

In the corrected code, after obtaining the result from `_aggregate_series_fast`, we check if it is a pandas Series with a dtype of `object`, and if so, we explicitly convert it to a decimal type using `astype("decimal")`. This ensures that the aggregation result reflects the correct dtype.

This corrective action will address the bug and the incorrect aggregation result that was causing the assertion error in the test cases.
