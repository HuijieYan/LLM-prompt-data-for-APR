The test case `test_append_empty_list` is calling the `append` method of the DataFrame with an empty list as the `other` argument. The purpose of this test case is to check if calling `append` with an empty list returns a new object.

The error is occurring in the `append` method due to the condition `not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame)`. When `other` is an empty list, `other[0]` does not exist, causing the `IndexError` to be raised.

The bug occurs because the method is trying to access the first element of the `other` list without checking if the list is empty.

To fix the bug, the method should first check if `other` is non-empty before trying to access its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) > 0 and not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
        other = DataFrame(other)
        if (self.columns.get_indexer(other.columns) >= 0).all():
            other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)

    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + other
    else:
        to_concat = [self, other]
    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```
