The error occurs when an empty list is passed to the `append` method of a DataFrame object. The buggy code attempts to access the first element of the empty list without checking if it's empty, leading to an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `other` variable is an empty list before trying to access its first element. If it's empty, we can return the original DataFrame immediately.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:  # Check if other is an empty list
        return self  # Return the original DataFrame
    # Rest of the original function logic goes here...
```

This fix ensures that if an empty list is passed to the `append` method, the original DataFrame is returned without attempting to access the first element of the empty list.

Once this fix is applied, the `IndexError` should no longer occur when calling `df.append([])` as shown in the test case.
