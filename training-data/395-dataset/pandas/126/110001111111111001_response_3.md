The error occurs when the buggy function is called with an empty list as the `other` parameter. The buggy function tries to access `other[0]` without checking if `other` is empty, leading to an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `other` is not an empty list before attempting to access its first element.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.
    ... (other function documentation remains the same) ...
    """
    if not isinstance(other, (list, tuple)) and not isinstance(other, (DataFrame, Series, dict)):
        raise TypeError("other should be a DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these")

    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        raise ValueError("When other is a list, it cannot be empty")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding this validation, the function will now raise a ValueError if an empty list is passed as `other`, avoiding the IndexError that occurred previously.
