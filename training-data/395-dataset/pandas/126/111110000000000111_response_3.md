The error occurs when an empty list is passed to the DataFrame.append() method. The buggy function is the append() method inside the DataFrame class.

The reason behind the bug is that the code does not handle the case of an empty list being passed to the append() method. The code assumes that if a list is passed, it must contain at least one DataFrame object, and it tries to access the first element of the list without checking if the list is empty or not.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition at the beginning of the append() method to check if the 'other' parameter is an empty list. If it is, we should return the original DataFrame without attempting any further operations.

Here's the corrected code for the append() method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self
    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```
