The potential error in the given function is caused by the incorrect handling of the 'other' parameter. The function should handle different data types and input structures appropriately, but it fails to do so, resulting in an incorrect behavior and possibly errors.

The function does not handle the cases where 'other' is a Series or a dictionary-like object correctly. It also fails to consider situations where 'other' is a list of non-DataFrame objects.

To fix the bug, the function should have proper conditional statements to handle different input types for the 'other' parameter. The function should also correctly handle the different types of input and perform the append operation accordingly.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, (pd.Series, dict)):
        other = pd.DataFrame(other)

    if isinstance(other, list) and not any(isinstance(x, pd.DataFrame) for x in other):
        other = pd.DataFrame(other)

    return pd.concat([self, other], ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity, sort=sort)
```

In the corrected function, we first check if 'other' is a Series or a dictionary-like object. If it is, we convert it into a DataFrame. Then, if 'other' is a list of non-DataFrame objects, we also convert it into a DataFrame. Finally, we use `pd.concat` to concatenate the 'self' and 'other' DataFrames, passing the appropriate parameters.
