The error occurs when an empty list is passed to the `DataFrame.append()` method. The code tries to access the first element of the list (`other[0]`) without checking if the list is empty (`other` is an empty list in this case), which results in the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case of an empty list being passed to the `DataFrame.append()` method by adding a check for an empty list and returning the original DataFrame in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `append()` method:

```python
# this is the fixed append function
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other)==0:
        return self  # Return the original DataFrame if other is an empty list
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...

    # original code for append() function
```

The added check `if isinstance(other, list) and len(other)==0` ensures that if `other` is an empty list, the original DataFrame will be returned without attempting to access the first element of the empty list.
