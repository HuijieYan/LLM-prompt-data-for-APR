The issue occurs when the `DataFrame.append` method is called with an empty list as the `other` parameter. This triggers a check for the first element of the list, which does not exist, leading to an `IndexError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement below:

```python
elif isinstance(other, list) and not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
```

This is where the code tries to access `other[0]` without checking if the list is empty, which leads to the `IndexError` when `other` is an empty list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statement to first check if the list `other` is not empty before performing the check for the first element. We should also handle the case when the list is empty to return the original DataFrame intact, as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `DataFrame.append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.
    
    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.
    
    ... (other comments remain unchanged)
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat
    
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) > 0:  # Check if the list is not empty
        if not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
            other = DataFrame(other)
            if (self.columns.get_indexer(other.columns) >= 0).all():
                other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)
    elif isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:  # If the list is empty, return the original DataFrame
        return self
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    to_concat = [self, other]
    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```

With this modification, the `DataFrame.append` method will first check if the `other` list is not empty before attempting to access the first element. If the list is empty, it will directly return the original DataFrame without raising an `IndexError`.
