The error occurs when the `append` method is called with an empty list. The function checks if the `other` parameter is a list and if its first element is not a DataFrame. However, when the list is empty, accessing the first element (`other[0]`) will result in an `IndexError` because there are no elements in the list.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case when `other` is an empty list separately, and return the original DataFrame in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:  # Check if other is an empty list
        return self
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
