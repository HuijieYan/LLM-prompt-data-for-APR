The error occurs because the `if` statement inside the `append` method checks if `other` is a list and then attempts to access `other[0]` without verifying if the list is empty. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access an element from an empty list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statement to first check if the list is not empty before attempting to access its first element.

Here is the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    # Existing code remains unchanged
    
    # New conditional statement to handle empty list case
    if isinstance(other, list):
        if len(other) > 0 and not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
            other = DataFrame(other)
            if (self.columns.get_indexer(other.columns) >= 0).all():
                other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)
        else:
            other = DataFrame()
    
    # Existing code remains unchanged
    
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + other
    else:
        to_concat = [self, other]
    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```

With this modification, the `append` method will first check if the `other` variable is a non-empty list. If it is non-empty, it will proceed with the original logic. If it is empty, it will assign an empty DataFrame to `other`. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when an empty list is passed to the `append` method.

This change ensures that the method handles the case of an empty list being passed to it without causing an error.
