The error occurs in the `else` part of the `if` block in the `self.append()` function. It attempts to access `other[0]`, assuming it is a list of DataFrames, but since `other` is an empty list, this leads to an `IndexError` because there are no elements in the list to access.

The bug occurs because the code wrongly assumes that `other` will always be a non-empty list. This causes an issue when the function attempts to access `other[0]` without verifying whether it's a non-empty list.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if `other` is a non-empty list before accessing its first element. If `other` is empty, the function should return the original DataFrame without attempting any further operations. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if not isinstance(other, list) or len(other) == 0:
        return self  # return original DataFrame if other is not a non-empty list
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

With this change, the function checks if `other` is a non-empty list. If it's not, the function returns the original DataFrame without performing any further operations. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when `other` is an empty list.
