The error occurs in the `DataFrame.append` function when an empty list is passed as the `other` parameter. The function attempts to access the first element of the `other` list, causing an IndexError.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not handle the case of an empty `other` list properly, and it assumes that `other` is a non-empty list and tries to access its first element.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `other` is an empty list. When `other` is empty, the function should return the original DataFrame without attempting to access the first element of the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `DataFrame.append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, (list, tuple)) and len(other) == 0:
        return self  # Return original DataFrame when other is an empty list

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + other
    else:
        to_concat = [self, other]
    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```

With this fix, when an empty list is passed as the `other` parameter, the original DataFrame will be returned, and the IndexError will be avoided.
