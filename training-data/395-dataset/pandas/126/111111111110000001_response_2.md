The test case `test_append_empty_list` is calling the `append` function on an empty DataFrame and passing an empty list as the parameter. The expected behavior is to return the original DataFrame in this case. However, the error message indicates that the function is trying to access the first element of the `other` parameter, which is an empty list, leading to an `IndexError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `elif` block that checks if `other` is a list and if the first element of `other` is not a DataFrame. This condition is causing the IndexError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect handling of the `other` parameter when it is an empty list. The function is assuming that there is at least one element in the list to perform the indexing, which is not the case when the list is empty.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case when `other` is an empty list as a special case and return the original DataFrame without attempting any data manipulation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self  # Return the original DataFrame when other is an empty list

    # Rest of the function code remains the same
    # ...
```

By adding a conditional check for an empty list, the function will return the original DataFrame without executing the problematic code that leads to the IndexError.
