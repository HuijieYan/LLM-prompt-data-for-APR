The error occurs because the function `append` attempts to access the first element of the `other` list when checking if it's a DataFrame. However, if `other` is an empty list, it throws an `IndexError` because there are no elements to access.

To fix this bug, a simple conditional check should be added at the beginning of the function to handle the case where `other` is an empty list. If `other` is empty, the function should return the current DataFrame without any modification.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:  # Handle empty list
        return self

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

By adding this conditional check, the function will return the current DataFrame when an empty list is passed as `other`, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
