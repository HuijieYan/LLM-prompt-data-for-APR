The error occurs because when the `other` parameter is an empty list, the function checks if `other[0]` is an instance of DataFrame. Since the list is empty, accessing the first element with `other[0]` raises an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if `other` is an empty list and return the original DataFrame accordingly, without trying to access a non-existent element in an empty list.

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.

```

This corrected function checks if `other` is a list and if it's empty. If it is, the original DataFrame is returned immediately. Otherwise, the function proceeds with the rest of the code to handle the non-empty `other` data.
