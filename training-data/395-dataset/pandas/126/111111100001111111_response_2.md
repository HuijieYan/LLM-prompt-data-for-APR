The problem lies in the `append` method within the `DataFrame` class. The error occurs because when an empty list is passed as the `other` parameter, the method checks if the first element of the list is a DataFrame. Since the list is empty, this check raises an `IndexError` because there is no first element to index.

The bug can be fixed by adding a check for an empty `other` list at the beginning of the `append` method. If the `other` list is empty, the method should simply return the original DataFrame without further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.

    DataFrame

    """
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:  # Add a check for an empty `other` list
        return self  # Return the original DataFrame if `other` is empty

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this fix in place, the `append` method will return the original DataFrame if an empty list is passed as the `other` parameter, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
