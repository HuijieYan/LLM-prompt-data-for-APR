The error message occurs when the `append` method is called with an empty list as the `other` parameter. The function tries to access `other[0]`, which results in an `IndexError` because the list is empty.

The root cause of the error is that the function does not handle the case where `other` is an empty list.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition at the beginning of the `append` function to check if `other` is an empty list, and if so, return the original DataFrame without performing any other operations.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if not other:  # Check if 'other' is an empty list
        return self  # Return the original DataFrame
    
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This modification ensures that the method returns the original DataFrame when an empty list is provided as the `other` parameter.

Applying this fix will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when calling the `append` method with an empty list, as demonstrated in the provided test cases.
