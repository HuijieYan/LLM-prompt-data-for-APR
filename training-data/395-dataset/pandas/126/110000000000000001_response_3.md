The potential error in the provided function is at the line `combined_columns = self.columns.append(idx_diff)`. The bug occurs because the `append()` method in pandas returns a new Index with the combined elements, it does not modify the existing Index in place, which leads to the incorrect assignment of `combined_columns`.

To fix this bug, we can use the `|` operator to combine the two sets of Index. Additionally, the code can be further simplified and improved to remove redundancy and improve readability.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    import pandas as pd

    if isinstance(other, (pd.Series, dict)):
        if isinstance(other, dict):
            other = pd.Series(other)
        if other.name is None and not ignore_index:
            raise TypeError(
                "Can only append a Series if ignore_index=True or if the Series has a name"
            )

        # Reindex the other Series to match the columns of self
        other = other.reindex(self.columns, copy=False)
        other = pd.DataFrame(other).T
    elif isinstance(other, list) and not isinstance(other[0], pd.DataFrame):
        # Convert list to DataFrame and match the columns of self
        other = pd.DataFrame(other, columns=self.columns)
    else:
        # Convert other DataFrame to match the columns of self
        other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)

    return pd.concat([self, other], ignore_index=ignore_index, sort=sort)
```
