The buggy function `append` is designed to append rows of `other` to the end of the dataframe, returning a new object. 

Based on the test cases provided:
- Buggy case 1: `self` is an empty dataframe with no columns or index, and `other` is an empty list. 
- Buggy case 2: `self` is a dataframe with columns and index, and `other` is an empty list. 

The potential error in the function is related to the logic for appending the `other` dataframe to the `self` dataframe. Based on the code and the provided test cases, it seems like the logic to handle appending an empty 'other' dataframe to an existing 'self' dataframe is not handled correctly.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the scenario where the `other` parameter is empty (an empty list or dataframe). This can result in unexpected behavior or errors when trying to perform operations on the `other` dataframe.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the `other` dataframe is empty and return the `self` dataframe without any modifications. This will prevent any unnecessary operations on the empty dataframe.

Here's the corrected code for the append function with the fix:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if len(other) == 0:  # Check if other dataframe is empty
        return self  # Return the original dataframe if other is empty

    # Rest of the code for appending other to self
    # ...
```

With this fix, the function will return the original dataframe `self` if the `other` dataframe is empty, preventing any unnecessary operations and potential errors.
