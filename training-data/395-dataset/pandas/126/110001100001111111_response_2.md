The error is occurring in the `append` method of the DataFrame class. This is due to the fact that the function does not handle the case of an empty list being passed as the `other` parameter. As a result, it tries to access `other[0]` which throws an IndexError since the list is empty.

To fix this issue, the function should handle the case of an empty list being passed as the `other` parameter and return the original DataFrame without attempting to perform any operations on the empty list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:  # Check if other is an empty list
        return self  # Return the original DataFrame
    # rest of the function code...
```
