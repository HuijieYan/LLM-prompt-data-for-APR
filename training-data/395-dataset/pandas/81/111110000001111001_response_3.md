The bug is located in the following section of the provided function:
```python
# coerce
if is_float_dtype(dtype):
    # In astype, we consider dtype=float to also mean na_value=np.nan
    kwargs = dict(na_value=np.nan)
else:
    kwargs = {}

data = self.to_numpy(dtype=dtype, **kwargs)
return astype_nansafe(data, dtype, copy=False)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional statement only checks if the dtype is a float dtype and sets na_value=np.nan accordingly. However, the given test case has a dtype of 'boolean' but is not handled in the conditional statement.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the dtype provided is 'boolean' and handle it appropriately. We can set na_value to True or False based on the dtype provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    """
    Cast to a NumPy array or IntegerArray with 'dtype'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : str or dtype
        Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.
    copy : bool, default True
        Whether to copy the data, even if not necessary. If False,
        a copy is made only if the old dtype does not match the
        new dtype.

    Returns
    -------
    array : ndarray or IntegerArray
        NumPy ndarray or IntergerArray with 'dtype' for its dtype.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        if incompatible type with an IntegerDtype, equivalent of same_kind
        casting
    """

    # coerce
    if is_float_dtype(dtype):
        # In astype, we consider dtype=float to also mean na_value=np.nan
        kwargs = dict(na_value=np.nan)
    elif dtype == 'boolean':
        kwargs = dict(na_value=True)  # or False, based on desired behavior
    else:
        kwargs = {}

    data = self.to_numpy(dtype=dtype, **kwargs)
    return astype_nansafe(data, dtype, copy=False)
```

In this corrected code, we have added an extra condition to handle the case when the dtype is 'boolean' and set na_value to True (or False depending on the desired behavior) accordingly.
