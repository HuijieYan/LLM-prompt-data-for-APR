The error in the function `_getitem_axis` is likely due to incorrect handling of the key parameter and its interaction with the MultiIndex that it's trying to access. The error message in the test cases indicates that a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected, suggesting that the key is being processed incorrectly.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to review the key handling logic in the `_getitem_axis` function. It's important to ensure that the key is correctly processed and used to access the MultiIndex. Additionally, the logic for handling MultiIndex and its labeling should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly handles the provided keys.

Here's the corrected function for `_getitem_axis`:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    key = item_from_zerodim(key)
    if is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
    if isinstance(labels, pd.MultiIndex):
        key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)

    if isinstance(labels, pd.MultiIndex) and isinstance(key, tuple):
        # handle MultiIndex slicing
        locs = labels.get_locs(key)
        indexer = [slice(None)] * self.ndim
        indexer[axis] = locs
        return self.obj.iloc[tuple(indexer)]

    self._validate_key(key, axis)
    return self._get_label(key, axis=axis)
```

In this corrected function, the key is properly processed for MultiIndex slicing, and the logic for getting the label or performing slicing is separate based on the type of index. This should address the potential issues with key handling and label retrieval while working with MultiIndex. Nonetheless, this function could be further improved based on the actual requirements and usage within the codebase.
