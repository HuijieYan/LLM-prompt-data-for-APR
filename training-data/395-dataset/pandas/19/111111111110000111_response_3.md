The error occurs in the `_getitem_axis` function, which is a part of the `_LocIndexer` class in the file `indexing.py`. The purpose of this function is to enable multi-indexing using the `loc` indexer.

The error occurs because the function is not handling the key correctly and is failing to raise a `KeyError` exception when certain keys are not found in the index. This causes the tests to fail as the expected behavior is not being met.

The key issue here is that the function is not appropriately handling the keys which are used for indexing. The logic for handling index keys, especially with multi-indexes, is complex and error-prone, leading to incorrect results and test failures.

To fix the issue, we need to review and revise the logic for handling keys in the `_getitem_axis` function. The logic should properly validate the key and handle the various indexing scenarios, including handling multi-indexes and raising the appropriate exception if a key is not found.

Here's the corrected code for the `_getitem_axis` function:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    if is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
    key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        self._validate_key(key, axis)
        return self._get_slice_axis(key, axis=axis)
    elif com.is_bool_indexer(key):
        return self._getbool_axis(key, axis=axis)
    elif is_list_like_indexer(key):
        self._validate_key(key, axis)

        # Handle multi-index keys
        if isinstance(labels, pd.MultiIndex):
            try:
                return self.obj.loc[key]
            except KeyError as e:
                raise KeyError(f"Key {e} not found in the index") from None

    # Default behavior for other types of keys
    self._validate_key(key, axis)
    return self._get_label(key, axis=axis)
```

In the corrected function, we have added specific handling for multi-index keys. If a key is not found, it will raise a `KeyError` with a meaningful message indicating which key was not found.

With this, we aim to improve error handling and provide more informative messages for the failure scenarios.
