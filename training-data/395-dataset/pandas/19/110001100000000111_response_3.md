The potential error location within the problematic function is when trying to access the len() of a potentially uninitialized object.

The bug occurs because the `key` variable is being used without being checked for its validity. It is assumed to be a list without checking if it is actually a list. This causes issues when the `key` is not a list, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, we should validate the `key` variable to ensure it is of the correct type before performing any operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    key = item_from_zerodim(key)
    if is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
    key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        self._validate_key(key, axis)
        return self._get_slice_axis(key, axis=axis)
    elif com.is_bool_indexer(key):
        return self._getbool_axis(key, axis=axis)
    elif is_list_like_indexer(key):

        # validate key
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ABCSeries, ABCDataFrame)) and not hasattr(key, "ndim"):
            raise ValueError("Invalid key type")

        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        ...
```
