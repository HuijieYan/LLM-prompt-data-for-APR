The error message in the test functions indicates that the `ser` object is not raising `KeyError` as expected when accessed using the key `key`. This suggests that the `_getitem_axis` function in the `_LocIndexer` class is not handling the key correctly, leading to the test failures.

The potential error in the `_getitem_axis` function could be related to the key handling, specifically when dealing with a numeric key that is not present in the index. This could lead to the function not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

The reason behind the bug could be a mismatch between the key passed to the `_getitem_axis` function and the actual index of the `ser` object, leading to the function not raising a `KeyError` when accessing the value associated with the key.

To fix the bug, the `_getitem_axis` function should be modified to correctly handle cases where the key is not present in the index, ensuring that it raises a `KeyError` as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_getitem_axis` function:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    key = item_from_zerodim(key)
    if is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
    try:
        key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

In the corrected function, a `try-except` block is used to catch the `KeyError` during the key retrieval process. If a `KeyError` is raised, it is re-raised with a meaningful error message indicating that the key is not in the index.

This modification ensures that if the key is not found in the index, the function will raise a `KeyError` as expected, thereby fixing the bug.
