Potential error location: 
The line `key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)` is causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the method `_get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key()` is not defined or has not been imported in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the method `_get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key()` is defined in the class or in any imported module. If it is not defined, it needs to be implemented or imported.
2. If the method is supposed to be defined in the `labels` class, then ensure that it is accessible by this class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    key = item_from_zerodim(key)
    if is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)

    if hasattr(labels, '_get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key'):
        key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        self._validate_key(key, axis)
        return self._get_slice_axis(key, axis=axis)
    # ... remaining code ...
```
