The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the utilization of `ser[key]` in the test functions. This is raising a `KeyError` instead of producing the expected output.

It appears that the bug is related to how the `key` is being used to access the Series `ser`. The error message clearly states that the raised `KeyError` is due to the key "5" not being found in the index.

To fix this bug, one approach is to check if the key exists in the index before attempting to access it. If the key does not exist, an exception should be raised.

Here's the corrected function for the buggy code:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    key = item_from_zerodim(key)
    if is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
    key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)

    # Check if the key exists in the index
    if key not in labels:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

By performing this check, we can prevent the `KeyError` from being raised unless the key genuinely does not exist in the index.
