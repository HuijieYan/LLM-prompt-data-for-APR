The error messages indicate that the function `_getitem_axis` is not handling the input key correctly, ultimately leading to a `KeyError`. This function is used for indexing a MultiIndex with a list of keys.

The problem seems to be related to the way the function `_getitem_axis` handles the key parameter. It appears that the function is not properly handling the `key` input, which leads to a `KeyError` when trying to index the DataFrame or Series based on the provided key.

To fix this bug, you should modify the logic inside the `_getitem_axis` function to properly handle the key input, creating appropriate checks and error handling for different types of keys and indexes. Additionally, the function should support MultiIndex indexing correctly.

Here's the corrected `_getitem_axis` function:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        # Check if the key is a list or numpy array
        if isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.MultiIndex):
            # For MultiIndex, use loc with the key to get the desired result
            return self.obj.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.Index):
            # For regular index, use iloc with the key to get the desired result
            return self.obj.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        # Handle slice object separately
        return self._get_slice_axis(key, axis=axis)
    else:
        # Handle any other types of key or raise a ValueError if unsupported
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type for indexing")
```

This corrected function checks the type of the `key` input and behaves accordingly. It properly handles the case for MultiIndex and regular Index, ensuring that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the index type. The function also maintains error handling for unsupported types of keys.
