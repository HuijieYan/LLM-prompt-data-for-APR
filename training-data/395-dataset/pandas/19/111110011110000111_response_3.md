The bug in the code seems to be related to the `ser[key]` line in the test function `test_getitem_intlist_multiindex_numeric_level`. The bug is causing the test to fail with the error message "Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'KeyError'>". This likely indicates that the buggy function `_getitem_axis` is not handling the key properly and not raising a `KeyError` when it should.

From the error message, it appears that the `ser[key]` call does not raise a `KeyError` as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_getitem_axis` function should be modified to handle the key appropriately and raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_getitem_axis` function:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    key = item_from_zerodim(key)
    if is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
    key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        self._validate_key(key, axis)
        return self._get_slice_axis(key, axis=axis)
        
    if key not in labels:
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")

    # rest of the code as it is...
```

In the corrected code, after processing `key` from the input, there's an explicit check to see if the `key` is present in the `labels` (index). If it's not present, a `KeyError` is raised with a message containing the missing key.

Applying this fix should ensure that the `_getitem_axis` function handles the key appropriately and raises a `KeyError` when needed. This should resolve the failing test cases.
