Potential error location: The error is likely in the if statement `if axis == 0:`. This statement is trying to determine the axis based on the input parameter `axis`, but the input parameter is not an int and can take values 'rows' or 'columns'. 

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring because the if statement is expecting an integer value for `axis` but receiving a string instead. This is causing the comparison `if axis == 0` to fail and not execute properly.

Approach to fix the bug: We can fix this bug by converting the string value of `axis` ('rows' or 'columns') to its corresponding integer value before comparing it with 0.

```python
def interpolate(self, method="linear", axis=0, limit=None, inplace=False, limit_direction="forward", limit_area=None, downcast=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Interpolate values according to different methods.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    
    if axis == 'rows':
        axis = 0
    elif axis == 'columns':
        axis = 1
        
    ax = self._info_axis_name
    
    if axis == 0:
        _maybe_transposed_self = self
    elif axis == 1:
        _maybe_transposed_self = self.T
    
    ax = _maybe_transposed_self._get_axis_number(ax)
    
    if _maybe_transposed_self.ndim == 2:
        alt_ax = 1 - ax
    else:
        alt_ax = ax
    
    # rest of the code remains the same
``` 

In the corrected code, we added conditions to convert the string values of 'rows' and 'columns' to their corresponding integer values before using them for comparison. This will ensure that the comparison with 0 is valid and the function runs without errors.
