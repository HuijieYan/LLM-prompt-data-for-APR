The error occurs in the `interpolate` method of the `NDFrame` class where the variable `ax` is referenced before it is assigned. This occurs specifically when the `axis` parameter is passed as a string, as shown in the test cases.

The reason for the bug is that the conditional block for handling `axis` does not assign the variable `ax` when `axis` is passed as a string. This leads to the `UnboundLocalError` when trying to reference `ax`.

To fix the bug, the conditional block should assign the variable `ax` in the `else` block when `axis` is not 0 or 1.

Here is the corrected code for the `interpolate` method:

```python
# signature of a relative function in this class
def interpolate(self, method='linear', axis=0, limit=None, inplace=False, limit_direction='forward', limit_area=None, downcast=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Interpolate values according to different methods.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    if axis == 0:
        ax = self._info_axis_name
        _maybe_transposed_self = self
    elif axis == 1:
        _maybe_transposed_self = self.T
        ax = 1
    else:
        _maybe_transposed_self = self
        ax = axis  # assign the variable ax when axis is not 0 or 1

    # rest of the method remains the same...
``` 

By adding the assignment of `ax` in the `else` block, the issue of referencing the variable before it's assigned is resolved. Additionally, it allows the function to correctly handle the case when `axis` is passed as a string.
