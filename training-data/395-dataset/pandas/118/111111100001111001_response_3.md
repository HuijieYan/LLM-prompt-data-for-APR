The key problem here is that the function is incorrectly modifying the `frame` object, which results in unexpected behavior. There is also an issue in the indexing and restructuring of the data, leading to errors related to column names and data alignment.

To address these issues, the following corrections should be made:
1. Instead of directly modifying the `frame` object, use a copy when necessary to avoid unintended side effects on the original frame.
2. During the data restructuring and sorting phase, ensure that the operations performed on the data align with the expected behavior and column structure.

Here's the corrected code for the `melt` function:

```python
def melt(
    frame: DataFrame,
    id_vars=None,
    value_vars=None,
    var_name: str = "variable",
    value_name: str = "value",
    col_level: Any = None,
) -> DataFrame:
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    if id_vars is not None:
        id_vars = [id_vars] if not isinstance(id_vars, (list, tuple)) else list(id_vars)
    else:
        id_vars = []

    if value_vars is not None:
        value_vars = [value_vars] if not isinstance(value_vars, (list, tuple)) else list(value_vars)
    else:
        value_vars = [col for col in frame.columns if col not in id_vars]

    df = frame.copy()
    df = df[id_vars + value_vars]

    if var_name not in df.columns:
        df.insert(0, var_name, np.repeat(value_vars, len(df) // len(value_vars)))

    melted = df.melt(id_vars=id_vars, value_vars=value_vars, var_name=var_name, value_name=value_name)

    return melted
```

In this corrected code:
1. We have used the `insert` method to handle the addition of the `var_name` column if it doesn't exist in the DataFrame.
2. We correctly handle the `id_vars` and `value_vars` to ensure that they are in the correct format before using them.
3. We avoid modifying the original dataframe `frame` and operate on a copy `df` throughout the function.

These corrections should address the issues in the original buggy function and ensure proper functionality.
