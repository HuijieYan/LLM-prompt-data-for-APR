The issue seems to be related to the treatment of numeric column names in the `pd.melt` function. The code attempts to use `Index(np.ravel(id_vars))` to check the presence of `id_vars` in the DataFrame, and it seems to be casting the numerical column name '1' to the string "1", leading to a KeyError.

The bug is likely occurring in the section of the code where the `id_vars` are being checked for presence in the DataFrame. It seems that the cast of numeric column names to strings is causing the issue.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle numeric column names properly and avoid casting them to strings in the process of checking the presence of `id_vars`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_cast_to_extension_array

def melt(
    frame: DataFrame,
    id_vars=None,
    value_vars=None,
    var_name=None,
    value_name="value",
    col_level=None,
) -> DataFrame:
    # Remaining code remains unchanged, only the following lines are modified
    if id_vars is not None:
        id_vars = [maybe_cast_to_extension_array(var) for var in id_vars]
    else:
        id_vars = []
    
    if value_vars is not None:
        value_vars = [maybe_cast_to_extension_array(var) for var in value_vars]
        frame = frame.loc[:, id_vars + value_vars]
    else:
        frame = frame.copy()
    
    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    ...
    return frame._constructor(mdata, columns=mcolumns)
```

In this corrected code, the `id_vars` and `value_vars` are cast to extension arrays using `maybe_cast_to_extension_array` to handle numeric column names properly and avoid the casting issue. This ensures that numeric column names are treated appropriately in the context of checking their presence in the DataFrame.
