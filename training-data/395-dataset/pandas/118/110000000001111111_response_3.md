The bug occurs in the `melt` function and is related to the handling of numeric column names. The error message indicates that when numeric column names are passed as `id_vars`, they are being cast to strings, causing the function to raise a `KeyError` for '1' not being present in the DataFrame.

The root cause of the issue lies in the way the function handles column names and the conversion of numeric column names to strings. This is likely due to a change in how pandas handles column names in newer versions, leading to a breaking change from older versions of pandas.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle numeric column names without converting them to strings.

Here's the corrected function for the `melt` method:

```python
def melt(
    frame: DataFrame,
    id_vars=None,
    value_vars=None,
    var_name=None,
    value_name="value",
    col_level=None,
) -> DataFrame:
    ...
    if id_vars is not None:
        if not is_list_like(id_vars):
            id_vars = [id_vars]
        else:
            # Check that `id_vars` are in frame
            id_vars = list(id_vars)
            missing = [col for col in id_vars if col not in frame.columns]
            if missing:
                raise KeyError(
                    "The following 'id_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: {missing}"
                    "".format(missing=missing)
                )
    else:
        id_vars = []
    ...

    return frame._constructor(mdata, columns=mcolumns)
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check if each column in `id_vars` is present in the DataFrame without relying on the `Index` conversion. If the columns are missing, a `KeyError` is raised with the list of missing columns. This approach should handle both string and numeric column names properly without unexpected type conversions.
