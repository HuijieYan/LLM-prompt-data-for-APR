The buggy function `astype` is trying to cast the categorical type to another data type. The error is occurring because the function is not handling the categorical data types effectively.

The error states "TypeError: data type not understood" and is caused when attempting to cast the categorical type to another data type. This issue is happening because the function is unable to effectively handle categorical data types and is not interpreting them correctly. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `astype` function to effectively handle the categorical data types and casting process.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype: Type, copy: bool = True) -> ArrayLike:
    """
    Coerce this type to another dtype

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : Type
        The desired dtype to which the type should be cast.
    copy : bool, default True
        By default, astype always returns a newly allocated object.
        If copy is set to False and dtype is categorical, the original
        object is returned.
    """
    if is_categorical_dtype(dtype):
        dtype = cast(Union[str, CategoricalDtype], dtype)

        if self.dtype == dtype:
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            else:
                return self
        else:
            return self._set_dtype(dtype)

    elif is_integer_dtype(dtype) and self.isna().any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN to integer")

    else:
        return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected `astype` function, we first check if the given `dtype` is a categorical data type. If it is, we handle the casting accordingly. If it's not a categorical data type, we continue with the regular data type casting.

After applying this correction, the function should effectively handle the categorical data types and resolve the "TypeError: data type not understood" issue. The associated test cases should now pass without any errors.
