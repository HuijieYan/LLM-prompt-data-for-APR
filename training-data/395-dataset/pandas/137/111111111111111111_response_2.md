The bug seems to be occurring when trying to cast a categorical column to its original dtype after being converted to a category. The test function `test_cast_category_to_extension_dtype` is using `astype` to cast to the expected dtype after converting the column to a category. However, the `astype` method is not handling the original dtype well in the Categorical class.

The issue is occurring because the `astype` method in the Categorical class is not returning the expected type when trying to cast back to the original dtype. This may be due to the implementation of the `astype` method in the Categorical class, which is not fully supporting all possible dtypes.

To fix this bug, it's important to update the `astype` method in the Categorical class to handle different types of dtypes. It should support returning the original dtype when casting back from a category.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    """
    Coerce this type to another dtype
    """
    if is_categorical_dtype(dtype):
        dtype = cast(Union[str, CategoricalDtype], dtype)

        # GH 10696/18593
        dtype = self.dtype.update_dtype(dtype)
        self = self.copy() if copy else self
        if dtype == self.dtype:
            return self
        return self._set_dtype(dtype)
    if is_integer_dtype(dtype) and self.isna().any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert float NaN to integer")
    # Handle casting back to the original dtype
    if dtype == self.dtype:
        return self
    return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
```

By including a condition that returns the current categorical column if the given dtype is the same as the current dtype, we ensure that casting back to the original dtype is properly handled.

This correction should address the bug and allow the `astype` method in the Categorical class to handle casting to and from different dtypes correctly.
