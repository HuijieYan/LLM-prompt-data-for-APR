The potential error in the `_get_nearest_indexer` function is in the line `op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le`. The issue is that `self.is_monotonic_increasing` is a method, but it is not called with parentheses. Therefore, instead of evaluating the method, the code is using the method object itself as the condition, which will always result in `True` because the method object exists.

To fix the bug, the `is_monotonic_increasing` method needs to be called with parentheses to evaluate it and use the result as the condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_nearest_indexer` function:

```python
# this is the buggy function fixed
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, method="pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, method="backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values()[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values()[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
