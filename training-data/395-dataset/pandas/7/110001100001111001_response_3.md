The buggy function `_get_nearest_indexer` is intended to return the indexer for the nearest index labels, based on certain conditions. However, it currently has several issues:

1. The line `op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le` compares the `self.is_monotonic_increasing` attribute to decide whether to use the less than (`lt`) or less than or equal to (`le`) operator. However, `self.is_monotonic_increasing` is a method, not a boolean attribute, so this comparison will always resolve to `True`, leading to incorrect behavior.

2. The variable `indexer` is calculated based on the above comparison, but it's not clear what the actual purpose of this variable is and how it is used later in the code.

To fix the issues with the function, the following steps can be taken:

1. Check the method `self.is_monotonic_increasing` and determine what its return value should be. If it's meant to be a boolean value, then the comparison with `operator.lt` and `operator.le` needs to be revised accordingly.

2. Ensure that the purpose of the `indexer` variable is clear and that its calculation aligns with the intended functionality of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    threshold = tolerance if tolerance is not None else 0
    indexer = np.where(left_distances < right_distances + threshold, left_indexer, right_indexer)

    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    
    return indexer
```
