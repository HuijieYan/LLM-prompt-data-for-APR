The error message indicates that there is an issue with subtracting the values in the `left_indexer` from the `target` due to a difference in data types for these operands.

The bug is likely to be in the `_get_nearest_indexer` method of the DataFrame class, where the data types of the `values` in `left_indexer` and the `target` are not compatible for subtraction.

This bug occurs when the index has datetime values with different time zones (tz aware) and the `method='nearest'` is used to reindex the DataFrame. When using tz aware datetime objects, the data type is different than regular datetime objects and this can cause compatibility issues when performing operations like subtraction. 

To fix this bug, the method `_get_nearest_indexer` needs to be modified to handle tz aware datetime objects appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_nearest_indexer` method:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)

    # Convert target to Timestamp if it's in a different type
    if not isinstance(target, pd.Timestamp):
        target = pd.Timestamp(target)

    # Ensure left_indexer values are compatible with target
    if left_indexer.dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]':
        left_indexer = left_indexer.tz_localize(None)

    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the corrected method, we validate the dtype of `left_indexer` and convert it to a compatible type, if necessary. Additionally, we ensure that the `target` is converted to a `Timestamp` if it's in a different type. This modification ensures that the subtraction operation between the two operands will be compatible and provide the expected results.
