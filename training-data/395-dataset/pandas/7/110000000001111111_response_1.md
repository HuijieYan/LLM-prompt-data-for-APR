The issue is likely caused by the datetimes being in a timezone-aware format. The conversion of timezone-aware `DatetimeIndex` to a timezone-naive `ndarray` with 'datetime64[ns]' dtype is causing the warning.

To fix the issue, we can modify the function to ensure that the datetime dtype is preserved as 'datetime64[ns]' and that the timezone awareness is maintained.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)  # Convert to numpy array
    if isinstance(target, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        target = pd.to_datetime(target, utc=True)

    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = np.less_equal if self.is_monotonic_increasing else np.less
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly convert the target to a timezone-aware format using `pd.to_datetime(target, utc=True)`. This ensures that the dtype is preserved and that the timezone awareness is maintained.

This should resolve the warning that was being raised when reindexing a tz aware index with method='nearest'.
