## Issue Analysis
The buggy function `_get_nearest_indexer` is used to get the indexer for the nearest index labels. It takes a target index and calculates the distances between the target index and the index values of the current object, using the `get_indexer` method. It then compares the distances to determine the nearest index labels.

The problem occurs when the `get_indexer` method returns an indexer. The method used to calculate the distances and determine the nearest index labels.

The bug occurs because the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is not being called. The function is_monotonic_increasing should be called as self.is_monotonic_increasing() to get the boolean value indicating if the index is monotonic increasing or not. Also, the function self._filter_indexer_tolerance should be called as self._filter_indexer_tolerance() to appropriately filter the indexer based on the tolerance.

## Bug Fix
We need to call the functions is_monotonic_increasing and _filter_indexer_tolerance correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

By calling the methods is_monotonic_increasing and _filter_indexer_tolerance correctly with `()` after their names, the bug should be fixed.
