Potential error location: The error occurs in the line `op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le`. The `is_monotonic_increasing` is a method, and it should be called with parentheses to execute the method and retrieve its result.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is trying to access the `is_monotonic_increasing` method as an attribute instead of calling it as a method. This will result in a `TypeError` because it is attempting to compare a method object to `operator.lt` and `operator.le`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Call the `is_monotonic_increasing` method using parentheses to get the result and then compare it with `operator.lt` and `operator.le`.

2. Check if the `is_monotonic_increasing` method returns the expected result, and update the comparison logic accordingly.

3. Ensure that the correct comparison logic is used for the `is_monotonic_increasing` method result.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le  # Call the method with parentheses
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
