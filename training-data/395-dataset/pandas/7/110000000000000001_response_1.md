Potential error location: 
The potential error location is in the comparison operation between `left_distances` and `right_distances` using the `operator.lt` or `operator.le` function. There is a missing parenthesis in the expression `op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1)` which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The missing parenthesis in the comparison operation could lead to incorrect comparison results and subsequently result in an incorrect indexer being returned.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Add the missing parenthesis to the expression `op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1)` to ensure correct order of operations and comparison.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import operator

def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        (op(left_distances, right_distances)) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
