The potential bug in the provided function is the comparison operation in the `np.where` method. This comparison operation uses the `operator.lt` function which is only appropriate when comparing numeric types. The error likely occurs when the function is provided with non-numeric types like strings or tuples, as mentioned in the function documentation.

To fix this bug, we'll need to update the comparison operator to handle non-numeric types.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    if self.is_monotonic_increasing:
        op = np.less_equal
    else:
        op = np.less
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the updated code, we replaced the `operator.lt` with `np.less` and `np.less_equal` to handle non-numeric types. This change will ensure that the comparison operation works correctly with different data types, as specified in the function documentation.
