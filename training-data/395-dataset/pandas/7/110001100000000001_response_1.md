The potential error in the _get_nearest_indexer function is that it is not calling the is_monotonic_increasing function correctly. It should be called as a method on 'self' and then compared with the operator inside the np.where function.

The reason for the bug is that the is_monotonic_increasing function is not being used as a method of the class object 'self'. Also, the comparison operator is not being used effectively inside the np.where function.

To fix the bug, we should call the is_monotonic_increasing function as a method of 'self' and use the comparison operator correctly inside the np.where function.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_nearest_indexer function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
