The error message shows that the function `_get_nearest_indexer` is causing a `UFuncTypeError` when trying to subtract two types of data. This error occurs when `abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)` is executed, indicating that the operands with types `dtype('<M8[ns]')` and `dtype('O')` cannot be used in this operation.

The reason behind this error is that the `target` data is being cast as an array of objects (dtype 'O'), which means the dtype is unknown or generic. This leads to incompatible types being used together in the subtraction operation.

To fix this bug, we should cast the `target` as an array of datetime64[ns] to ensure that the types are compatible for the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_nearest_indexer` function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target).astype('datetime64[ns]')
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
