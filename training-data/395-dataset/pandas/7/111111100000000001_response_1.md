Potential Error Location: The error might be occurring in the line `op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le` where `self.is_monotonic_increasing` is not being called as a method.

Reason for the Bug: The function `is_monotonic_increasing` is defined as a method in the `Index` class, but it is not being called with parentheses. Therefore, it is not being executed as a method, and its value is not being checked properly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We can fix the bug by calling the `is_monotonic_increasing` method properly using parentheses.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values()[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values()[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt() if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le()
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
