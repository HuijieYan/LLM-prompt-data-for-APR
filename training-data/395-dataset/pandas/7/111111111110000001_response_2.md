The error message indicates that there is a problem with the subtraction operation in the `_get_nearest_indexer` function. Specifically, the error is a result of attempting to subtract two different data types. The error occurs when trying to execute `abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)`.

The bug stems from the fact that `self.values[left_indexer]` and `target` are not compatible for subtraction. `self.values[left_indexer]` is of type `numpy.ndarray` while `target` is of type `object`. The subtraction operation between these two different data types is not valid, resulting in the UFuncTypeError.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that `target` and `self.values[left_indexer]` are of compatible types. You may need to ensure that `target` is converted to a NumPy array so that the subtraction operation can be performed between two arrays of matching types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_nearest_indexer` function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    target_values = np.asarray(self.values[left_indexer])
    left_distances = abs(target_values - target)
    
    right_distances = np.asarray(self.values[right_indexer]) - target

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
In this corrected code, we ensure that both `target` and `self.values[left_indexer]` are converted to NumPy arrays before performing the subtraction operation. This ensures compatibility and resolves the UFuncTypeError.
