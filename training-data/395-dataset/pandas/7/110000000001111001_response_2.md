The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the comparison between the left_distances and right_distances using the operator lt (less than) or le (less than or equal to).

The bug occurs because the function is designed to work with numeric data, where comparisons such as less than or less than or equal to make sense. However, when dealing with datetime objects, these comparisons may not yield the expected results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between left_distances and right_distances to consider datetime objects properly. This can be achieved by using the `argmin` function available in numpy, which returns the indices of the minimum values along an axis.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    indexer = np.where(
        np.less_equal(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
