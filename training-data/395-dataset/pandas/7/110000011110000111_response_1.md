The error occurs because the function `_get_nearest_indexer` is trying to subtract a timezone-aware `DatetimeIndex` from an ndarray, which is not supported by NumPy and Pandas. This leads to a UFuncTypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_get_nearest_indexer` function to handle timezone-aware objects properly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray([t.to_pydatetime() for t in target])  # Convert timestamps to datetime objects
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the corrected function, we convert the timestamp values in the `target` array to timezone-naive datetime objects before performing the subtraction. This ensures that the operation is supported by NumPy and Pandas.

After making this change, the function should be able to handle timezone-aware objects properly and avoid the UFuncTypeError that was occurring before.
