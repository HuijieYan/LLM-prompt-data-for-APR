Potential Error:

The potential error in the code is with the comparison of `left_distances` and `right_distances` using the `operator.lt` or `operator.le`. The logic for comparing these distances might not be correct.

Reason for the Bug:

The bug might be occurring due to incorrect comparison logic for `left_distances` and `right_distances`. Also, the comparison with `right_indexer` might not be working as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Compare the distances using a different comparison logic, such as checking if the left or right distance is less than a tolerance value.
2. Check for any issues with the logic for comparing and selecting the nearest index.

```python
# Corrected function
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    if tolerance is not None:
        left_distances[left_distances > tolerance] = np.inf
        right_distances[right_distances > tolerance] = np.inf

    indexer = np.where(left_distances < right_distances, left_indexer, right_indexer)
    return indexer
