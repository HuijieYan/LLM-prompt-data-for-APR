The buggy function `_get_nearest_indexer` is designed to find the indexer for the nearest index labels by calculating the distances from the target values. The function retrieves left and right indexer values using the `get_indexer` method, then calculates the distances between the target values and the values corresponding to these indexers. After that, it compares the distances and returns the indexer with the smaller distance, taking into account the `tolerance` if provided.

The bug in the code seems to be in the comparison operation `op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le`. This line of code intends to check if the index is monotonic increasing and assign the corresponding operator to the variable `op`. However, the issue here is that `self.is_monotonic_increasing` is not being called as a method to return its value. Instead, it's accessed directly which could lead to a typo or misunderstanding from the developer if `is_monotonic_increasing` is meant to be a method.

To fix the bug, the correct way to call `self.is_monotonic_increasing` should be `self.is_monotonic_increasing()`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt() if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le()
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
