The error occurs when the `_get_nearest_indexer` function is invoked by the `reindex` method in the test cases. The error message indicates that the `ufunc 'subtract'` is unable to use operands with types `dtype('<M8[ns]')` and `dtype('O')`. This suggests that there is an issue with the operands used in the subtraction operation within the `_get_nearest_indexer` function.

The reason behind this bug is that the index values are of different types and do not support subtraction with each other.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the index values used in the subtraction operation are of the same type. This can be achieved by converting the target to a NumPy array of pandas Timestamp objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_nearest_indexer` function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.array([pd.Timestamp(val) for val in target])
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the corrected code, the target values are converted to a NumPy array of pandas Timestamp objects. Consequently, the subtraction operation will now work correctly without encountering the previous error.
