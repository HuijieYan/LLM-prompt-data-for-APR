The error message is a `UFuncTypeError` which is occurring in the `_get_nearest_indexer` function. The error is coming from the line `left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)`.

The reason for the error is that the data type of `target` is different from the data type of `self.values[left_indexer]`. It seems that `target` is of type `object`, while `self.values[left_indexer]` is of type `datetime64[ns]` which is causing the `UFuncTypeError` during the subtraction operation.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the data types are compatible before performing the subtraction. One approach is to convert `target` to the same data type as `self.values[left_indexer]` before performing the subtraction operation.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_nearest_indexer` function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    target = target.astype('datetime64[ns]')  # Ensure target is of type datetime64[ns]
    
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
