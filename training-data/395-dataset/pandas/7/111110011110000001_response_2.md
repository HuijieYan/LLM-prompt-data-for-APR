The error is occurring in the `_get_nearest_indexer` function. The error message "numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: ufunc 'subtract' cannot use operands with types dtype('<M8[ns]') and dtype('O')" suggests that there's an issue with subtracting the values of the DateTimeIndex from the provided target.

The reason for the bug is that the values of the DateTimeIndex are being subtracted from the target, which is not a supported operation. Additionally, the `target` is being converted to an array of objects, causing the ufunc 'subtract' error.

The potential approach for fixing this bug is to directly subtract the values of the DateTimeIndex without converting the target to an array of objects.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_nearest_indexer` function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the corrected code, the direct subtraction is performed between the values of the DateTimeIndex and the target. The unnecessary conversion of the target to an array of objects has been removed.
