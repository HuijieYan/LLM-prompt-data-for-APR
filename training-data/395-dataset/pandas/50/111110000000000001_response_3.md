Potential error location: The potential error in the code lies in the comparison operations performed in the function. There could be issues with comparing unordered categoricals, different category lengths, and unordered and different order categoricals.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may occur due to inadequate input validation and comparison logic for categorical data.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Improve input validation to ensure that comparisons are only made between categoricals that have the same categories and ordering.
2. Check for unordered categoricals and handle comparison operations accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    # Add input validation and comparison logic based on the above analysis
    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Categorical):
            raise TypeError("Can only compare Categoricals with other Categoricals.")

        if len(self.categories) != len(other.categories):
            raise ValueError("Lengths of categories must match.")

        if self.ordered != other.ordered:
            raise ValueError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'ordered' is the same.")

        if not self.ordered and not (self.categories == other.categories).all():
            raise ValueError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same.")

        if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
            if not self.ordered:
                raise TypeError("Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not")

        # Perform the comparison based on the validated input
        f = getattr(self._codes, opname)
        ret = f(other._codes)
        
        mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other._codes == -1)
        ret[mask] = False

        return ret

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```
