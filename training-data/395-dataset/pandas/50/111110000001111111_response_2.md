The issue seems to be related to the behavior of NaN in comparison operators for categorical data types as opposed to string data types. The comparison operators for categorical data types produce different results when one of the values is NaN.

The bug is likely located in the `_cat_compare_op` function, where the behavior for comparison operators is defined for categorical data. The issue might be related to how NaN values are handled in this function, leading to different results compared to string data types.

The bug occurs because the function `_cat_compare_op` does not handle NaN values consistently for comparison operations, leading to different results when comparing categorical data with string data.

To fix this bug, the `_cat_compare_op` function should be modified to handle NaN values consistently for comparison operations, ensuring that the behavior aligns with that of string data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cat_compare_op` function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        # Handle NaN values consistently for comparison operations
        self_nan = (self == np.nan)
        other_nan = (other == np.nan)

        if opname in ["__eq__", "__ne__"]:
            if self_nan.any() or other_nan.any():
                result = (self_nan == other_nan)
            else:
                result = (self == other)
        else:
            result = (self == other)

        return result

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In the corrected code, the `func` function now handles NaN values consistently for comparison operations, ensuring that the behavior aligns with that of string data types. This should resolve the issue with different results for comparison operations between categorical and string data types.
