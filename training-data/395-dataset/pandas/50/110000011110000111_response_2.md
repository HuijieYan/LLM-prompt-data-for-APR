The error is likely occurring in the `__ne__` (not equal) comparison within the `func` method of the `_cat_compare_op` function. The error message shows that the assertion `assert result.all()` is failing, indicating that the comparison is not working correctly.

The problem seems to be related to comparisons involving NaN values when using the `Categorical` data type. The error message suggests that the behavior of NaN in comparison operators is different for type `category` than for `str`.

The bug may be happening because of the way the `Categorical.from_codes` method is handling NaN values when creating the categorical data.

A possible approach to fix the bug could involve checking how NaN values are handled when creating categorical data and how they are treated in comparison operations.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cat_compare_op` function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            # TODO: Could this fail if the categories are listlike objects?
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(other.dtype):
            if self.ordered:
                if self.categories.equals(other.categories):
                    return getattr(self._codes, opname)(other._codes)
                else:
                    raise TypeError("Categories must match for comparison.")
            else:
                raise TypeError("Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not")
        else:
            return getattr(np.asarray(self), opname)(other)

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

This corrected code addresses the issue with comparing `Categorical` objects and potentially resolves the different behavior observed in the comparison operators. Given the complexity and the number of potential edge cases, further testing is recommended to ensure the function works as expected in various scenarios.
