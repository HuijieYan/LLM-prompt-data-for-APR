The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison between two categorical series with NaN values. The test function `test_not_equal_with_na` compares two `Categorical` objects and asserts that the result of the comparison is true for all elements. However, the comparison operates incorrectly in the presence of NaN values.

The potential error location within the function is where it handles comparisons between `Categorical` objects and scalar values or other `Categorical` objects with NaN values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle NaN values correctly in comparison operations of `Categorical` objects. This leads to incorrect comparison results, as evidenced by the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle NaN values appropriately in comparison operations of `Categorical` objects. This may involve checking for NaN values and treating them differently from non-NaN values during comparisons.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError("Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not")

        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            # Handling NaN values in comparison
            is_nan_self = self.isna()
            is_nan_other = other.isna()

            if is_nan_self.any() or is_nan_other.any():
                return self.codes == other.codes

            # Rest of the comparison logic remains unchanged
            # ...
```

In the corrected function, we added a section to handle NaN values in comparisons between `Categorical` objects. If either of the objects contains NaN values, the comparison is performed directly on the codes, and the presence of NaN values is accounted for in the comparison results. This should address the issue with incorrect comparison results observed in the test case.
