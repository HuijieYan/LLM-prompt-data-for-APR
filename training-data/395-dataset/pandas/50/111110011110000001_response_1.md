The buggy function `_cat_compare_op()` is used in the `Categorical` class for performing comparisons with other `Categorical` objects as well as scalar values. The test function `test_not_equal_with_na` is meant to test the functionality of the `!=` operator with `Categorical` objects, but it's failing with an assertion error.

The error is likely occurring within the `_cat_compare_op()` function, specifically in the comparison logic for different categories of `Categorical` objects. The `array([False, True])` returned from the result of `c1 != c2` is not what is expected.

The reason for the bug could be due to incorrect comparison logic, especially when dealing with uninitialized or missing values (-1) in the `Categorical` objects. The comparison might not be handling the uninitialized values correctly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for uninitialized values (-1) needs to be revised. Additional checks and handling for uninitialized values should ensure that comparisons with uninitialized values are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cat_compare_op()` function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            # TODO: Could this fail if the categories are listlike objects?
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if np.any(self._codes == -1) or np.any(other._codes == -1):
            # check for uninitialized values (-1)
            uninitialized_mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other._codes == -1)
            result = np.empty(len(self), dtype=bool)
            result[uninitialized_mask] = False
            result[~uninitialized_mask] = op(self._codes[~uninitialized_mask], other._codes[~uninitialized_mask])
            return result
        else:
            # perform comparison without uninitialized values
            return op(self._codes, other._codes)

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In the corrected code, the function checks for uninitialized values (-1) and constructs the result accordingly. This should ensure that comparisons with uninitialized values are handled correctly, resolving the assertion errors in the test function.
