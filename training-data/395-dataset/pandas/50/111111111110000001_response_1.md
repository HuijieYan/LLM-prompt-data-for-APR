The error occurs when the `assert result.all()` is triggered in the test case. The error messages indicate that the values of `result` are not as expected.

The bug in the problematic function is likely related to the comparison of categorical data. The function may not be handling the comparison of categorical data correctly, which leads to incorrect results in the test cases.

The function needs to be fixed by ensuring that the comparison logic for categorical data is implemented correctly. This may involve checking the equality of categories and properly handling the comparison of different categories, including when `NaN` values are present.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError("Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not")

        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            if not self.categories.equals(other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same.")

            if not (self.ordered == other.ordered):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'ordered' is the same")

            # perform comparison
            ret = self._codes.compare(other._codes, op)

            return ret

        elif is_scalar(other):
            # handle scalar comparison
            return self._codes.scalar_compare(other, opname)

        else:
            # handle comparison with other types
            result = self._codes.compare_with_other_types(other, opname)
            return result

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In this corrected function, we've made sure to properly compare the categories and ordered status of the categorical data. We've also incorporated different comparison logic based on whether it's a categorical data, a scalar value, or another data type. This should resolve the issues with the test cases and the comparison of categorical data.
