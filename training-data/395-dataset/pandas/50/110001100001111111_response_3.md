The bug occurs in the function `_cat_compare_op`. The function takes an operator as input and generates a comparison function based on the operator. The issue arises in the comparison of Categorical Series with NaN values, which returns unexpected results compared to regular string Series.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle NaN values properly when comparing Categorical Series. When comparing Categorical Series, the code needs to account for NaN values and its comparison with other categories.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cat_compare_op` function to handle NaN values properly when comparing Categorical Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cat_compare_op` function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                )
        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            # Handle NaN values in comparison
            if self.isna().any() or other.isna().any():
                return self.isna() & other.isna()
            
            # Rest of the comparison code remains the same
            # ...

        # Rest of the code for scalar and other comparisons remains the same
        # ...

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In the corrected code, we have added a specific handling for NaN values when comparing Categorical Series. We use the `isna()` method to identify NaN values and apply the appropriate logic for comparisons involving NaN.

This should fix the issue with the comparison of Categorical Series and provide the expected behavior.
