The buggy function `_cat_compare_op` seems to be designed to compare categories, but it is encountering issues related to the comparison operations. The bug is likely related to how the function is handling the comparison operations such as 'lt', 'gt', 'eq', 'ne', 'le', and 'ge'.

The bug seems to be caused by the way the function is constructing the `opname` variable using `op.__name__`. It is then using this `opname` to perform comparisons and raise errors based on comparison results. However, the implementation is incorrect, leading to the observed failures.

To fix this bug, the function should directly use the input `op` to perform the comparison operations instead of manipulating it to create `opname`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cat_compare_op` function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(op)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if op in [operator.gt, operator.lt, operator.ge, operator.le]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                )
        
        # Rest of the function remains the same

    return func
```

By directly using the `op` parameter for comparison operations, the corrected function should be able to handle the comparison operations correctly and address the bugs observed in the test cases.
