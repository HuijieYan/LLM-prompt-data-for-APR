It appears that the issue lies in the comparison operations for Categorical data types. The bug is causing different behavior in the comparison operators for Categorical data types as compared to string data types. The code is not handling NaN values correctly in the comparison operations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_cat_compare_op` function to correctly handle NaN values and ensure consistent behavior between Categorical and string data types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        # ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...
        # Add the following block of code to handle NaN values
        if opname in ["__eq__", "__ne__"]:
            mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other_codes == -1)
            if mask.any():
                # For equality and inequality comparisons, convert NaN values to True as expected
                ret[mask] = True
        
        return ret

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

This fix includes handling NaN values in the comparison operations for Categorical data types, ensuring that the behavior of the comparison operations is consistent with other data types such as strings.
