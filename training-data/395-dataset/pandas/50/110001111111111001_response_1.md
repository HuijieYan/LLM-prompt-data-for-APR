The buggy function `_cat_compare_op` is intended to handle different comparison operations for the `Categorical` class in Pandas. The issue seems to be related to the comparison of different categories, leading to unexpected behavior in the tests.

Upon further analysis, it appears that the bug is occurring due to the logic related to comparing ordered and unordered categoricals. The comparison of categories and checking for equality are not properly handled, resulting in incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to revisit the comparison logic and ensure that the equality checks are correctly implemented for different categories. This may involve refining the logic for comparing ordered and unordered categoricals, as well as addressing potential discrepancies in category comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_cat_compare_op`:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            if not (
                self.ordered == other.ordered
                and set(self.categories) == set(other.categories)
            ):
                raise ValueError("Categories and ordering must match for comparison.")

            f = getattr(self._codes, opname)
            other_codes = other._codes
            ret = f(other_codes)
            mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other_codes == -1)
            if mask.any():
                ret[mask] = False
            return ret
        elif is_scalar(other) and other in self.categories:
            i = self.categories.get_loc(other)
            ret = getattr(self._codes, opname)(i)
            if opname not in {"__eq__", "__ge__", "__gt__"}:
                mask = self._codes == -1
                ret[mask] = False
            return ret
        elif is_scalar(other) and other not in self.categories:
            raise ValueError("Other scalar value is not in categories.")
        else:
            if opname in ["__eq__", "__ne__"]:
                return getattr(np.array(self), opname)(np.array(other))
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported operation: {opname}")

    func.__name__ = opname
    return func
```

This corrected code revises the logic for category comparison and handles the operations based on ordered and unordered categoricals. It addresses the potential issues related to category comparison and is expected to resolve the bug.
