The potential error in the provided function is that it is attempting to compare the lengths of 'self' and 'other' without checking if they are iterable.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that 'other' is iterable, checks its length, and raises a ValueError if its length does not match 'self'. However, it does not explicitly check if 'other' is iterable. This can lead to exceptions if 'other' is not iterable.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if 'other' is iterable before comparing lengths. If 'other' is not iterable, it should take the appropriate action based on the comparison operation being performed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if not hasattr(other, '__len__'):
            raise TypeError(f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {opname} with "
                            f"type {type(other)}.\nIf you want to compare values, "
                            "use 'np.asarray(cat) <op> other'.")

        if len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        # rest of the function remains the same...

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```
