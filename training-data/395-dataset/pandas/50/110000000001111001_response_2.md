The issue with the provided function is that it is using a decorator called 'unpack_zerodim_and_defer' that is not defined within the function. This is causing a NameError as the decorator is being called but not defined.

To fix this issue, the 'unpack_zerodim_and_defer' decorator needs to be imported in the file where the function is defined. Once the decorator is imported and defined, the function should work as expected.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    # import the decorator here
    from some_module import unpack_zerodim_and_defer

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer
    def func(self, other):
        # the rest of the function remains unchanged
        ...

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```
