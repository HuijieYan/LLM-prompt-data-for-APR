The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` creates two MultiIndex objects `midx1` and `midx2` and then attempts to join `midx1` with `midx2` using the `join` method, setting `return_indexers` to `False`. The expected result is for the `result` to be equal to `midx1`. However, the test fails with an assertion error because the `result` is not of the expected type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely in the `_join_multi` method. It seems that the method is not correctly handling the case when `return_indexers` is False.

The bug occurs because the `_join_multi` method does not properly handle the case when `return_indexers` is False. It may be returning a type of result that is not expected by the calling method, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_join_multi` method should be modified to correctly handle the case when `return_indexers` is False and ensure that the result returned matches the expected type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` method:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
        from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
        from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

        other_names = list(other.names)
        overlap = set(self_names) & set(other_names)
    
        # need at least 1 in common
        if not overlap:
            raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")
    
        self_is_mi = isinstance(self, ABCMultiIndex)
        other_is_mi = isinstance(other, ABCMultiIndex)
    
        if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
    
            # Drop the non-matching levels from left and right respectively
            ldrop_names = list(self_names - overlap)
            rdrop_names = list(other_names - overlap)
    
            # if only the order differs
            if not len(ldrop_names + rdrop_names):
                self_jnlevels = self
                other_jnlevels = other.reorder_levels(self.names)
            else:
                self_jnlevels = self.droplevel(ldrop_names)
                other_jnlevels = other.droplevel(rdrop_names)
    
            # Join left and right
            # Join on same leveled multi-index frames is supported
            join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(
                other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True
            )

                self, other, dropped_names, join_idx, lidx, ridx
            )
    
            # Re-create the multi-index
            multi_join_idx = MultiIndex(
                levels=levels, codes=codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False
            )
    
            multi_join_idx = multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()
    
            return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx
    
        jl = list(overlap)[0]

        if self_is_mi:
            self, other = other, self
            flip_order = True
            # flip if join method is right or left
            how = {"right": "left", "left": "right"}.get(how, how)
    
        level = other.names.index(jl)
        result = self._join_level(
            other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers
        )
    
        if flip_order:
            if isinstance(result, tuple):
                return result[0], result[2], result[1]
