The bug is likely to be found in the `_join_multi` function of the `Index` class. Based on the input values and the expected values, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying the common levels between two multi-level index objects and not handling the merging/joining of these indexes appropriately.

The bug appears to stem from the incorrect identification of the overlap (common levels) between the multi-indexes, and the subsequent joining and restoration of dropped levels are not being performed correctly.

To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the common levels between the multi-indexes are correctly identified, and that the dropping and joining of levels are done according to the expected logic.
2. Verify that the restoration of dropped levels is performed correctly to generate the expected `multi_join_idx`.
3. Ensure that all methods and operations related to multi-index manipulation are being called with the correct parameters and logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    self_names = set(self.names)
    other_names = set(other.names)
    overlap = self_names & other_names

    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("Cannot join with no overlapping index names")

    self_is_mi = isinstance(self, MultiIndex)
    other_is_mi = isinstance(other, MultiIndex)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        ldrop_names = list(self_names - overlap)
        rdrop_names = list(other_names - overlap)

        self_jnlevels = self.droplevel(ldrop_names)
        other_jnlevels = other.droplevel(rdrop_names)

        join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True)

        dropped_names = ldrop_names + rdrop_names

        levels, codes, names = _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin(self, other, dropped_names, join_idx, lidx, ridx)

        multi_join_idx = MultiIndex(levels=levels, codes=codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
        multi_join_idx = multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()
        
        return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx

    jl = list(overlap)[0]

    flip_order = False
    if self_is_mi:
        self, other = other, self
        flip_order = True
        how = {"right": "left", "left": "right"}.get(how, how)

    level = other.names.index(jl)
    result = self._join_level(other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)

    if flip_order:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            return result[0], result[2], result[1]
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the common levels are correctly identified and dropped, and the joining process is performed based on the correct logic. The restoration of dropped levels and the creation of the `MultiIndex` are also done as expected.
