The potential error location in the _join_multi function is the if statement "if not overlapping:". This is because the code raises a ValueError if there are no overlapping index names, but the variable 'overlapping' is not defined before this check.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the variable 'overlapping' is not defined before it is used in the if statement.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to calculate the overlapping index names before the if statement, and then perform the check.

Here's the corrected code for the _join_multi function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    
    # figure out join names
    self_names = set(com.not_none(*self.names))
    other_names = set(com.not_none(*other.names))
    overlap = self_names & other_names
    
    # need at least 1 in common
    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")
    
    self_is_mi = isinstance(self, ABCMultiIndex)
    other_is_mi = isinstance(other, ABCMultiIndex)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        ...
    else:
        jl = list(overlap)[0]
    
        # Case where only one index is multi
        # make the indices into mi's that match
        flip_order = False
        if self_is_mi:
            self, other = other, self
            flip_order = True
            # flip if join method is right or left
            how = {"right": "left", "left": "right"}.get(how, how)
    
        level = other.names.index(jl)
        result = self._join_level(
            other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers
        )
    
        if flip_order:
            if isinstance(result, tuple):
                return result[0], result[2], result[1]
        return result
```
