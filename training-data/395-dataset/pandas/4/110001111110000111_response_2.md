The error message indicates that the join method is returning a tuple instead of the expected Index object. This suggests that the issue is in the join method, especially in the _join_multi function where join is called.

The bug occurs because the return_indexers parameter is not being handled properly in the _join_multi function. The return_indexers parameter should control whether indexers are returned or not, but in the current implementation, it is not being used to make this distinction.

To fix the bug, the return_indexers parameter should be properly handled in the _join_multi function call to join method. It should be passed to the join method to ensure that the return indexers are only returned when the parameter is set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the _join_multi function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    # remaining code...

    join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(
        other_jnlevels, how, level=level, return_indexers=return_indexers
    )

    # remaining code...
```

In this correction, the return_indexers parameter is properly handled and passed to the join method. This ensures that the return indexers are only returned when the parameter is set to True.
