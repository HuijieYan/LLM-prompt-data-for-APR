The error message indicates that the `join` method is returning a tuple instead of a `MultiIndex` object, causing an assertion error in the test function.

The potential error location within the `_join_multi` function is where it returns the result. It should return a `MultiIndex` object, but it seems to be returning a tuple in some cases.

The bug occurs because the `_join_multi` function is not consistently returning the expected output type. In some cases, it returns a tuple instead of a `MultiIndex` object, leading to the assertion error in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_join_multi` function consistently returns a `MultiIndex` object, or a tuple with a `MultiIndex` object as its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if flip_order:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            result = (result[0], result[2], result[1])
        else:
            result = (result, )

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we check if `result` is a tuple and rearrange its elements if necessary. This ensures that the `_join_multi` function consistently returns the expected output type.
