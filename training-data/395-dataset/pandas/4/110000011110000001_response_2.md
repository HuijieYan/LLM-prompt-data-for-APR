The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` is attempting to join two multi-indexes and checking if the result is equal to `midx1`. The error message indicates that an `AssertionError` is raised because the expected type is `pandas.core.indexes.base.Index`, but instead it found a tuple.

The potential error in the `join` function is likely related to the handling of multi-indexes and the return type.

The bug is occurring because the function is returning a tuple in certain cases, but the test case is expecting an Index type.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to ensure that the function returns an Index type instead of a tuple. This can be achieved by modifying the return statements in the function to return the appropriate Index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

    # figure out join names
    self_names = set(com.not_none(*self.names))
    other_names = set(com.not_none(*other.names))
    overlap = self_names & other_names

    # need at least 1 in common
    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")

    self_is_mi = isinstance(self, ABCMultiIndex)
    other_is_mi = isinstance(other, ABCMultiIndex)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        # Join left and right
        join_idx = self.join(other, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)
        return join_idx

    jl = list(overlap)[0]

    # Case where only one index is multi
    level = other.names.index(jl)
    result = self._join_level(other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)

    return result
```

With this correction, the `_join_multi` function will return an Index type as expected by the test case.
