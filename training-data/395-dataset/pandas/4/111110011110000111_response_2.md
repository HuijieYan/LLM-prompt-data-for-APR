The provided test case attempts to call the `join` method on a MultiIndex object and expects the result not to return indexers. However, the error message indicates that the assertion failed because a tuple was returned instead of an Index object.

The potential error location within the `_join_multi` method of the `Index` class is where the tuple is being returned:
```python
if isinstance(result, tuple):
    return result[0], result[2], result[1]
```

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not handling the `return_indexers` parameter properly. It should return a MultiIndex when `return_indexers` is False, rather than a tuple.

To fix the bug, the `_join_multi` function should be modified to return the `result` when `return_indexers` is False, without modifying the order of the returned items. This can be achieved by simply returning `result` when the condition is not met.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    # ... (omitted code)

    if isinstance(result, tuple) and not return_indexers:
        return result

    return result
```

This change ensures that the correct return value is used depending on the `return_indexers` parameter.
