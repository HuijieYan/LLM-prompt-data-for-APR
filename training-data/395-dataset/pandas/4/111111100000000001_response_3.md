The potential error in the given code is in the `_join_multi` function. It seems that the function is trying to handle multi-index join operations, but it has a mix of old and new API calls, which may lead to inconsistencies and errors.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. Inconsistency in the use of old and new API calls for multi-index joins.
2. The handling of levels and indexes in the multi-index join operation is not consistent.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the latest API calls and methods for multi-index join operations for consistency.
2. Ensure that the handling of levels and indexes is consistent throughout the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
        from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
        from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _remove_the_level_by_name

        # figure out join names
        self_names = set(self.names)
        other_names = set(other.names)
        overlap = self_names & other_names

        # need at least 1 in common
        if not overlap:
            raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")

        self_is_mi = isinstance(self, MultiIndex)
        other_is_mi = isinstance(other, MultiIndex)

        if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
            left_result = _remove_the_level_by_name(self, list(self_names - overlap))
            right_result = _remove_the_level_by_name(other, list(other_names - overlap))

            join_idx, lidx, ridx = left_result.join(right_result, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)

            # Re-create the multi-index
            multi_join_idx = join_idx
            return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx

        jl = list(overlap)[0]

        level = other.names.index(jl)
        result = self._join_level(other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)

        return result
```
