The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` creates two MultiIndex objects, `midx1` and `midx2`, and then calls the `join` method on `midx1` with `midx2` as the input. The `return_indexers` parameter is set to `False`. The test then asserts that the result of the join operation is equal to `midx1`.

The error message indicates that the type of the `left` value is a tuple instead of an Index type. This implies that the buggy function is returning a tuple instead of an Index, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return` statement. The return is returning a tuple containing multiple values, one of which should be the result of the join operation.

The bug occurred because instead of returning just the result of the join operation, the function mistakenly returned multiple values as a tuple.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to only return the result of the join operation, ensuring that the return type is an Index, as expected by the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `join` method:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    # existing code...
    
    # ... (omitted)

    # Join left and right
    # Join on same leveled multi-index frames is supported
    join_idx = self_jnlevels.join(other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True)

    return join_idx   # Only return the result of the join operation
```

By modifying the problematic function to return only the result of the join operation, the bug should be fixed, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
