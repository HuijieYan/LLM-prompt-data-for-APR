Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the code is within the if statement where it checks for self_is_mi and other_is_mi.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is trying to access the `names` attribute of `self` and `other` without explicitly defining them as MultiIndex objects. This could lead to AttributeError or incorrect results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self` and `other` are instances of MultiIndex before trying to access their `names` attribute.
2. If they are not MultiIndex instances, handle the case appropriately.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    from pandas.core.indexes.api import _ensure_index
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import _MultiIndex

    self = _ensure_index(self)
    other = _ensure_index(other)

    if not isinstance(self, _MultiIndex) or not isinstance(other, _MultiIndex):
        raise ValueError("Both inputs must be MultiIndex")

    # rest of the original function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
```
