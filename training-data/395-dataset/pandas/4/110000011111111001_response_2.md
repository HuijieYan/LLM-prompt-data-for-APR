The problem in the `test_join_multi_return_indexers` function is that it's expecting `result` to be an Index type, but it's actually a tuple. This indicates that the `join` function is returning the wrong type.

The bug in the code lies in the `_join_multi` function, where there is a return statement that returns three variables: `multi_join_idx`, `lidx`, and `ridx`. When this return statement is executed, the function actually returns a tuple of these three variables, instead of just `multi_join_idx`. This is why the `assert_index_equal` function in the test case fails.

The corrected code should modify the return statement in the `_join_multi` function to only return `multi_join_idx` and not a tuple of multiple variables.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    # ... (existing code)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        # ... (existing code)

        return multi_join_idx  # Only return the multi_join_idx and not a tuple of multiple variables
    else:
        result = self._join_level(other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)
        
        if flip_order:
            if isinstance(result, tuple):
               return result[0], result[2], result[1]
        return result
```

With this correction, the `join` method will only return the `multi_join_idx` as expected, and the test case should pass without any issues.
