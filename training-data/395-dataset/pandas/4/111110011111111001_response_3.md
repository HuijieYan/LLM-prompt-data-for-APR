The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers()` creates two multi-indexes `midx1` and `midx2`, and then joins them using the `join` method. The test then uses `assert_index_equal` to check if the result is equal to `midx1`.

The error message indicates that the type of the `result` is a tuple, while the expected type is an Index. This suggests that the `join` method is returning a tuple instead of an Index as expected.

The problematic function is `_join_multi` in the provided source code. The potential error location in the function is where it returns `multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx`. Based on the test case and the error message, the function seems to be returning a tuple of variables instead of just `multi_join_idx`.

This happens because the function returns `multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx` which is interpreted as a tuple. The correct return statement should only be `multi_join_idx`.

To fix the bug, the return statement in the `_join_multi` function should be modified to only return `multi_join_idx` and remove the unnecessary return of `lidx` and `ridx`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    # ... existing code ...

    # previous code for processing and creating multi_join_idx...

    return multi_join_idx  # fixed return statement
```
