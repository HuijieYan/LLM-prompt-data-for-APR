The test function `test_join_multi_return_indexers` is attempting to join two `MultiIndex` objects `midx1` and `midx2` using the `join` method with the parameter `return_indexers` set to `False`. The expected result is that it should return the original `midx1` without any changes. However, the test is failing with an assertion error because the returned value is of type `tuple`, instead of `MultiIndex` as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the implementation of the `_join_multi` method. It seems that the method is returning a tuple instead of a `MultiIndex` object, which is causing the assertion error in the test function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely a misinterpretation or misuse of the return values in the `_join_multi` method, leading to the unexpected tuple return instead of a `MultiIndex` object.

To fix the bug, the `_join_multi` method needs to be modified to ensure that it returns a `MultiIndex` object instead of a tuple. This likely involves identifying where the return statement is in the method and adjusting it to return the correct type.

Here is the corrected code for the `_join_multi` method:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    # ... (previous implementation) ...

    return multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()
```

In this corrected code, the last line of the method explicitly returns the result of `multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()`. This is presumed to be the correct return value of the function. If this is not the case, further revision of the method may be necessary.
