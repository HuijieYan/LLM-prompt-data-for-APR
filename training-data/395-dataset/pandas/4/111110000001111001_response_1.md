The buggy function is attempting to join two MultiIndex objects, self and other, by aligning the levels of the indices. However, the function is encountering an issue when attempting to restore the dropped levels after the join.

The issue appears to be in the calculation of levels, codes, and names when attempting to restore the dropped levels. The code is attempting to create a new MultiIndex based on the restored levels, but it is not handling the process correctly.

To fix the bug, the code should properly organize the steps for restoring the dropped levels and creating the new MultiIndex.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    self_names = set(com.not_none(*self.names))
    other_names = set(com.not_none(*other.names))
    overlap = self_names & other_names

    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")

    self_is_mi = isinstance(self, ABCMultiIndex)
    other_is_mi = isinstance(other, ABCMultiIndex)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        # Drop the non-matching levels from left and right respectively
        ldrop_names = list(self_names - overlap)
        rdrop_names = list(other_names - overlap)

        self_jnlevels = self.droplevel(ldrop_names)
        other_jnlevels = other.droplevel(rdrop_names)

        join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True)

        levels, codes, names = _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin(self, other, ldrop_names, join_idx, lidx, ridx)

        multi_join_idx = MultiIndex(levels=levels, codes=codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
        multi_join_idx = multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()

        return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx
    else:
        # Handle the case where only one index is a MultiIndex
        # Ensure the correct joining of indices
        flip_order = False
        if self_is_mi:
            self, other = other, self
            flip_order = True
            how = {"right": "left", "left": "right"}.get(how, how)

        level = other.names.index(list(overlap)[0])
        result = self._join_level(other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)

        if flip_order:
            if isinstance(result, tuple):
                return result[0], result[2], result[1]
        return result
```

In the corrected code, the process for restoring dropped levels and creating the new MultiIndex has been adjusted to address the issue. This should handle the alignment of levels and indices correctly and resolve the bug.
