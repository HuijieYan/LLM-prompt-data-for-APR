The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` creates two multi-indexes, `midx1` and `midx2`, and then tries to join `midx1` with `midx2` using the `join` method, with the parameter `return_indexers` set to `False`. The expected result is to assert that the result of the join is equal to `midx1`. However, the test fails with an `AssertionError` because the type of the result is a tuple instead of an Index.

The potential error location within the `def _join_multi` function is the line:
```python
return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx
```
This line returns a tuple `(multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx)` instead of just `multi_join_idx` as an Index, leading to the test failure.

The bug occurs because the function `_join_multi` is expected to return only the `multi_join_idx` as the result, but it mistakenly returns a tuple containing more values than expected. This inconsistency in returning the wrong data type causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to return only the `multi_join_idx` without any additional values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    # ...existing code...
    return multi_join_idx
```
