The bug occurs in the `_join_multi` method of the `Index` class. The bug is due to the incorrect type of the `other` parameter. It is expected to be an instance of `MultiIndex`, but it is not being passed as such.

To fix the bug, the `other` parameter needs to be instantiated as a `MultiIndex` object before being used within the `_join_multi` function. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` method:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex

    if not isinstance(other, MultiIndex):
        other = MultiIndex(other)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

With this correction, the `_join_multi` method will work as expected.
