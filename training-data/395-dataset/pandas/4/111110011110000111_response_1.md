The error occurs when running the test `test_join_multi_return_indexers`. The test case checks if the result of `midx1.join(midx2, return_indexers=False)` is equal to `midx1` without considering the indexers, but it fails with an AssertionError. The error message indicates that the expected type was an `Index` object, but a tuple was found instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function `_join_multi` is likely in the return statement where `multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx` are returned as a tuple. This could be the reason for the unexpected tuple type being returned.

The bug occurs because the `return_indexers` parameter in the `_join_multi` function has no impact on the returned value, and indexers are always returned, ignoring the parameter value.

To fix the bug, the `return_indexers` parameter should be properly utilized to conditionally return the indexers based on its value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_join_multi`:
```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    
    # Existing code remains unchanged
    
    if return_indexers:
        return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx
    else:
        return multi_join_idx
```
In the above corrected code, the `return_indexers` parameter is properly used to conditionally return the indexers based on its value. If `return_indexers` is True, then the indexers are returned as a tuple, otherwise only the `multi_join_idx` is returned.
