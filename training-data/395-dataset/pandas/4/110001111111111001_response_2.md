The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` is trying to join two MultiIndex objects (`midx1` and `midx2`) without returning any indexers. The expected result is `midx1`, as `midx1` is being joined with `midx2` which does not overlap completely.

The error message indicates that the type of the variable `left` is a tuple, instead of the expected type which is `Index`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `join` method, specifically in the `_join_multi` method where the return type is not handled correctly.

The bug occurred because the `_join_multi` method is not correctly handling the return type. It is trying to return a tuple containing the multi-index and two arrays, but the code calling this method is expecting only the multi-index itself.

To fix the bug, the `_join_multi` method should handle the return type correctly by just returning the multi-index without converting it to a tuple.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        # ... (omitted code) ...

        return multi_join_idx  # Only return the multi-index

    jl = list(overlap)[0]
    # ... (omitted code) ...
    return result  # Only return the result
```

With this change, the `_join_multi` method now returns the multi-index directly, which is the expected return type in the test case.
