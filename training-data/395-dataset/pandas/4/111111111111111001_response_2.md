The error message indicates that the `join` method is returning a tuple instead of an `Index` object, which is causing the `assert_index_equal` function to fail.

Upon analyzing the `join` method inside the `_join_multi` function, it appears that the issue lies in the line:
```
return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx
```
Here, the function is returning a tuple `(multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx)` instead of just `multi_join_idx`, which is causing the assertion error.

The occurrence of the bug is because the method `_join_multi` is supposed to return a single `multi_join_idx` of type `MultiIndex`, but it's currently returning a tuple of three values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the return statement in the `_join_multi` method to only return the `multi_join_idx` and remove `lidx` and `ridx`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` method:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    if flip_order:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            return result[0], result[2], result[1]
        return result
    return result  # Return only the multi_join_idx
```

By making this change, the function will now return only the `multi_join_idx`, ensuring that it matches the expected return type, and the assertion error should be resolved.
