The test case `test_interpolate_unsorted_index` calls the `interpolate` method on a pandas Series with NaN values and unsorted index. The expected result is a linear interpolation based on the index. However, the error message indicates that the actual result does not match the expected result.

The potential error location in the `interpolate_1d` function is likely within the logic that handles the `method="index"` case, which should perform linear interpolation based on the index values.

The bug occurs because the interpolation method "index" is not handled correctly. The calculation of the result and the preservation of NaN values after interpolation might be causing incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the 'method="index"' case should be properly implemented to perform linear interpolation based on the index values, and the preservation of NaN values after interpolation needs to be handled carefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if method in ["linear", "index"]:
        inds = np.asarray(xvalues)
        result = np.interp(inds, inds[yvalues.notna()], yvalues[yvalues.notna()], left=np.nan, right=np.nan)
        return pd.Series(result, index=xvalues)

    # ... (existing code)
```

In the corrected code:
- We handle the "index" interpolation method by using `np.interp` to perform linear interpolation based on the index values.
- We return the result as a pandas Series using the original xvalues as the index.
- We apply `np.nan` for points outside the range in the `np.interp` call to match the behavior of pandas `interpolate` method.
- We return a pandas Series as the result, ensuring it is consistent with pandas behavior.
