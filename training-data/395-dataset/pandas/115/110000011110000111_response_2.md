The error message indicates that there is a difference in the series values after interpolation is applied. The test case provides a series of data where some values are NaN and an interpolate method is called using the 'index' method. The expected result is defined manually based on the sorted index.

The potential error in the `interpolate_1d` method is in the logic for the 'index' method of interpolation.

The bug occurs because the 'index' method of interpolation does not handle the case where the index is not sorted with ascending=True. This causes unexpected results when performing interpolation.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for the 'index' method of interpolation to handle cases where the index is not sorted with ascending=True. Additionally, we need to sort the index if it is not already sorted in ascending order. This will ensure that the interpolation is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # ... (other implementation remains the same)

    if method in ["linear", "time", "index", "values"]:
        if method in ("values", "index"):
            inds = np.asarray(xvalues)
            if not np.all(np.diff(inds) > 0):
                # Sort the index if it is not already sorted
                sort_order = np.argsort(inds)
                inds = inds[sort_order]
                yvalues = yvalues[sort_order]
        # ... (other implementation remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, when the method is 'index', an additional check is added to see if the index is sorted in ascending order. If not, the index and corresponding yvalues are sorted, and the interpolation is then performed. This ensures that the 'index' interpolation method works correctly, regardless of the order of the index.
