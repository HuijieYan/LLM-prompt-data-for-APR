The error message indicates that the `assert_series_equal` function raised an AssertionError because the actual and expected values were different. The error occurred when calling the `interpolate` method on an unsorted index, which resulted in unexpected values in the output.

The potential error location within the `interpolate_1d` function is likely related to the section where the index is used for interpolation, under the condition where the method is "index".

The issue occurred because the `interpolate` method with the "index" method was applied to a Series with an unsorted index. This caused unexpected values to be used for interpolation, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to add a check for the sorted order of the index and raise a warning if the index is not sorted in ascending order, as suggested in the GitHub issue description.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` method:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_list_like
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import isna
from pandas.core import algorithms as algos
from pandas.core.internals import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs.conversion import needs_i8_conversion
from pandas._libs.interpolate import interp_1d
from pandas._libs.missing import interpolate_1d as _interpolate_scipy_wrapper


def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """

    # Check if xvalues is sorted in increasing order
    if not is_list_like(xvalues) or is_integer(xvalues) or not algos.is_monotonic_increasing(xvalues):
        raise ValueError("xvalues must be a 1d array-like with monotonically increasing values")

    invalid = isna(yvalues)
    valid = ~invalid

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the `xvalues` are sorted in increasing order. If they are not, a ValueError is raised to indicate that `xvalues` must be a 1d array-like with monotonically increasing values. This change aligns with the GitHub issue description, aiming to prevent unexpected results when using the "index" method in an unsorted index.
