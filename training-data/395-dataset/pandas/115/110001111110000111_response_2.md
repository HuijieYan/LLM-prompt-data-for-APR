The bug is likely occurring within the `interpolate_1d` function due to the incorrect handling of the `method='index'` in the `interpolate` function. The test case `test_interpolate_unsorted_index` is trying to use the `interpolate` method with `method='index'` on an unsorted index, leading to unexpected results and causing an assertion error.

The bug occurs because the `interpolate_1d` function does not correctly handle the `method='index'` in the `interpolate` method when the index is unsorted. This leads to the unexpected behavior in the interpolation.

To fix the bug, the `interpolate_1d` function should be modified to properly handle the `method='index'` when the index is unsorted. It should raise a warning or handle the mismatch in the index order to ensure correct interpolation results.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    if method == "index":
        # Check if the index is sorted
        if not xvalues.equals(xvalues.sort_values()):
            raise Warning("Interpolation with method='index' may yield unexpected results when the index is not sorted.") 
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, a warning has been added to check if the index is sorted when using `method='index'` for interpolation. If the index is not sorted, it raises a warning to alert the user about the potential consequences of using `method='index'` with an unsorted index.
