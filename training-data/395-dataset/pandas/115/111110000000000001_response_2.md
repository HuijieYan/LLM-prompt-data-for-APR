The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect usage of the kwargs parameter. The function uses **kwargs without defining it in the function signature.

The error occurs because **kwargs is used to pass variable keyword arguments to a function, but since it is not defined in the function signature, it causes a syntax error.

To fix the bug, remove the **kwargs parameter from the function signature since it is not being used in the function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
