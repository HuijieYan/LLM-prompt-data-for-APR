The error occurs in the `interpolate_1d` function. It seems that when calling `ts.sort_index(ascending=ascending).interpolate(method="index")`, the `interpolate_1d` function returns unexpected results due to the unsorted index. The issue appears to be related to the incorrect handling of the `method='index'` interpolation when the index is not sorted.

The `interpolate_1d` function does not seem to handle the unsorted index properly when the method is 'index'. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect results during the interpolation process.

One approach to fixing the bug could be to ensure that the `interpolate_1d` function handles the unsorted index properly when the method is 'index'. The function should either sort the index before performing the interpolation or raise a warning to alert the user about potential errors in the output due to the unsorted index.

The corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function is as follows:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    # ... (omitted code)
    
    if method == "index":
        if not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing and not xvalues.is_monotonic_decreasing:
            warnings.warn("Interpolation with method='index' might be affected by unsorted index.", UserWarning)

    # Continue with the rest of the interpolation logic

    # ... (omitted code)
```

In this corrected code, a warning is raised when the method is 'index' and the index is not sorted. This will alert the user about the potential issues with the unsorted index during interpolation. Additionally, the suggested fix would involve sorting the index before performing the interpolation if necessary to ensure correct results.
