The potential error location within the problematic function is in the method signature and parameter handling. The **kwargs parameter is not correctly implemented, causing a syntax error.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The use of **kwargs, which is not correctly implemented in the method signature.
2. Incorrect ordering and handling of the method parameters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the **kwargs and handle all optional parameters explicitly in the method signature.
2. Ensure that the method parameters are correctly ordered and handled based on their data types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```
