The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect usage of the kwargs variable. In the function definition, it is specified as `**kwargs,` which means it is expecting a dictionary of keyword arguments. However, when this kwargs variable is used in the `_interpolate_scipy_wrapper` function call, it is being passed as `**kwargs,` which is an incorrect way to pass a dictionary of keyword arguments.

To fix this bug, the corrected function should use `**kwargs` instead of `**kwargs,` when passing the keyword arguments to the `_interpolate_scipy_wrapper` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
        xvalues,
        yvalues,
        method="linear",
        limit=None,
        limit_direction="forward",
        limit_area=None,
        fill_value=None,
        bounds_error=False,
        order=None,
        **kwargs
    ):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...
```
With this correction, the bug related to the incorrect usage of kwargs in the function is fixed.
