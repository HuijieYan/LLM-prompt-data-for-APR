The error message indicates that the `interpolate` method is not producing the expected values. This is likely due to the issue in the `interpolate_1d` function where the method 'index' is not correctly handling unsorted indices.

The bug is likely occurring in the section of the `interpolate_1d` function where the `method` parameter is handled. When `method` is 'index', the function should be sorting the indices in ascending order before performing the interpolation. The bug is likely causing incorrect interpolation results when the indices are unsorted.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to sort the indices before performing interpolation when the `method` is 'index'. This will ensure that the interpolation is performed using the correct indices.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    
    if method in ["linear", "time", "index", "values"]:
        if method in ["index"]:
            # Sort the indices in ascending order
            sorted_indices = np.argsort(xvalues)
            xvalues = xvalues[sorted_indices]
            yvalues = yvalues[sorted_indices]
        
        # Perform the interpolation using the sorted indices
        inds = np.asarray(xvalues)
        result = yvalues.copy()
        invalid = np.isnan(yvalues)
        valid = ~invalid
        result[invalid] = np.interp(inds[invalid], inds[valid], yvalues[valid])
        result[sorted_indices[invalid]] = np.nan
        return result

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected code ensures that when the method is 'index', the indices are sorted in ascending order before performing the interpolation, fixing the bug observed in the test case provided.
