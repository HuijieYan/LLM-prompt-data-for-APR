The bug occurs because the `method='index'` is being used with an unsorted index. This can lead to unexpected results and potential errors in the output, as demonstrated by the test cases.

The potential error location in the code is the block where the interpolation method is handled:

```python
if method in ("values", "index"):
    inds = np.asarray(xvalues)
    # hack for DatetimeIndex, #1646
    if needs_i8_conversion(inds.dtype.type):
        inds = inds.view(np.int64)
    if inds.dtype == np.object_:
        inds = lib.maybe_convert_objects(inds)
else:
    inds = xvalues
result[invalid] = np.interp(inds[invalid], inds[valid], yvalues[valid])
result[preserve_nans] = np.nan
return result
```

To fix this issue, a conditional check should be added to validate whether the index is sorted in ascending order. If it is not sorted, a warning should be raised to alert the user about the potential errors in the output and recommend sorting the index before using the interpolation method 'index'.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function with the added conditional check and warning:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # ... (other existing code)

    if method == 'index' and not xvalues.equals(xvalues.sort_values()):
        # Check if the index is not sorted in ascending order
        warnings.warn("The index is not sorted in ascending order. Using method='index' may lead to unexpected results. Consider sorting the index before using this method.")
        
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

With this correction, the function will raise a warning when `method='index'` is used with an unsorted index, alerting the user about the potential issues and suggesting sorting the index before using the interpolation method.
