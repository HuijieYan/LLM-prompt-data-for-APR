The error occurs because the original implementation of the `interpolate_1d` function does not handle the case when the `method` is set to 'index' and the Index is not sorted with `ascending=True`. This results in unexpected behavior when interpolating.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `interpolate_1d` function to handle the 'index' method correctly.

The corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Logic for handling 'index' method
    if method == "index":
        if isinstance(xvalues, pd.Index):
            if xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing or xvalues.is_monotonic_decreasing:
                return yvalues.interpolate(method=method, limit=limit, limit_direction=limit_direction, limit_area=limit_area, fill_value=fill_value, axis=0)
            else:
                raise Warning("Warning: calling .interpolate(method='index') when Index is not sorted with ascending=True may result in unexpected output.")

    # Rest of the original logic for the 1-d interpolation
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a block to handle the "index" method using the `pd.Index` properties to check if the index is sorted with `ascending=True`. If it is not sorted, a warning is raised to alert the user. Otherwise, the `interpolate` method is called as usual.
