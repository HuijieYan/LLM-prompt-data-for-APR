The issue occurs because the `interpolate_1d` function does not handle the case where the input Index is not sorted with `ascending=True` when using the `method='index'` interpolation. This results in unexpected behavior and incorrect output.

The potential error location is within the logic that handles the `method='index'` interpolation. The `indexer` variable is used to determine the order of the index, but it is not being recalculated if the index is not in ascending order.

To fix the bug, the `indexer` variable should be recalculated using the sorted index before performing the interpolation.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation. The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if method in ["linear", "time", "index", "values"]:
        if method in ("values", "index"):
            inds = np.asarray(xvalues)
            # hack for DatetimeIndex, #1646
            if needs_i8_conversion(inds.dtype.type):
                inds = inds.view(np.int64)
            if inds.dtype == np.object_:
                inds = lib.maybe_convert_objects(inds)
            indexer = np.argsort(xvalues)  # Recalculate indexer using sorted index
        else:
            inds = xvalues
            indexer = np.arange(len(inds))

        result[invalid] = np.interp(inds[invalid], inds[valid][indexer[valid]], yvalues[valid])
        result[preserve_nans] = np.nan
        return result

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the `indexer` is recalculated when the method is 'index', ensuring that the interpolation will use the correct index order even if it is not in ascending order. This should prevent the unexpected behavior and incorrect output when using the `method='index'` interpolation.
