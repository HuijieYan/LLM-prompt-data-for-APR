The issue seems to stem from the use of the `method='index'` in the `interpolate_1d` function. In the given test case, the `Int64Index([10, 9, 3, 2, 1], dtype='int64')` is not sorted with ascending=True, which leads to unexpected results in the interpolation.

The bug occurs because the `interpolate_1d` function does not handle the case where the index is not sorted with ascending=True when using the `method='index'`. This results in unexpected behavior and incorrect interpolation values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `interpolate_1d` function to raise a warning when the index is not sorted with ascending=True and the `method='index'` is used in the interpolation. This warning will alert the user to potential errors in the output due to the non-sorted index.

Here's the corrected function with the added warning:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    if method == "index":
        if not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing:
            # Raise a warning if the index is not sorted with ascending=True
            # and the method='index' is used for interpolation
            pd.compat.PandasWarning("Interpolation may produce unexpected results due to non-sorted index.")
    
    # rest of the function as it is
    # ...
```

With this update, the function will raise a warning when the index is not sorted with ascending=True and the `method='index'` is used for interpolation. This will alert the user to potential issues and provide more clarity on the results.
