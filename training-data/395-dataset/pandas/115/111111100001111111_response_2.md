The issue occurs when using the `interpolate` method with `method='index'` on a Series or DataFrame where the index is not sorted with ascending=True. This results in unexpected interpolation values, as shown in the provided test cases.

The potential error location within the `interpolate_1d` function is in the section where the variable `inds` is initialized with `np.asarray(xvalues)`. If the index is not sorted in ascending order, this could lead to unexpected interpolation results.

The bug occurs because the `interpolate_1d` function does not check if the index is sorted before performing the interpolation with `method='index'`. This can lead to incorrect interpolation if the index is not sorted in ascending order.

To fix the bug, a check should be added to ensure that the index is sorted before performing the interpolation with `method='index'`. If the index is not sorted in ascending order, a warning should be raised to alert the user about potential errors in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Check if the index is sorted in ascending order
    if isinstance(xvalues, pd.Index) and not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing:
        warnings.warn("The index is not sorted in ascending order, which may lead to unexpected interpolation results.")

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
``` 

In this corrected code, a warning will be raised if the index is not sorted in ascending order to alert the user about potential errors in the output of the `interpolate` method with `method='index'`.
