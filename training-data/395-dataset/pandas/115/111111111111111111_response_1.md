The error occurs in the `interpolate_1d` function, specifically in the block where the `method` is 'index'. When the method is 'index', the function should interpolate based on the index values. However, the interpolating behavior is incorrect when the index is not sorted in ascending order.

The reason behind this bug is that the function does not handle the case where the index is not sorted with ascending=True when using the 'index' method for interpolation.

To fix this bug, an additional check needs to be implemented to ensure that the index is sorted in ascending order when using the 'index' method. If the index is not sorted, a warning should be raised to alert the user, indicating that errors in the output could be possible.

Below is the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    if method == "index" and not xvalues.equals(xvalues.sort_values()):
        import warnings
        
        warnings.warn("The index is not sorted with ascending=True. Errors in the output could be possible.", UserWarning)
    
    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

By adding the check and warning as described, this corrected code should resolve the issue described in the GitHub issue.
