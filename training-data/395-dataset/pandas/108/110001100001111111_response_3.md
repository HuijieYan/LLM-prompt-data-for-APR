The bug is occurring because the function is not correctly identifying the dtype for Interval objects when `pandas_dtype` is set to True. The function is always returning the dtype as `np.object_` instead of correctly inferring it as an `IntervalDtype`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly infer the dtype for Interval objects when `pandas_dtype` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def infer_dtype_from_scalar(val, pandas_dtype: bool = False):
    """
    Interpret the dtype from a scalar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pandas_dtype : bool, default False
        whether to infer dtype including pandas extension types.
        If False, scalar belongs to pandas extension types is inferred as
        object
    """

    dtype = np.object_

    if isinstance(val, pd.Interval):
        if pandas_dtype:
            dtype = pd.IntervalDtype()
        else:
            dtype = np.object_

    return dtype
```

This corrected function will correctly infer the dtype as `pd.IntervalDtype` when `pandas_dtype` is set to True, and as `np.object_` otherwise.
