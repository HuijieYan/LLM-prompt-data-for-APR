The bug in the function `infer_dtype_from_scalar` is that the logic inside the function is not correctly inferring the dtype for certain input types. For example, the input types `Interval`, `Timedelta`, and `Timestamp` are not being handled correctly, resulting in the dtype being inferred as `np.object_` for all these cases, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the function to correctly handle these input types and infer the dtype accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `infer_dtype_from_scalar` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs import Timestamp, Timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Period, PeriodDtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes import DatetimeTZDtype
from pandas.core import ints

def infer_dtype_from_scalar(val, pandas_dtype: bool = False):
    if isinstance(val, (np.integer, int)):
        if isinstance(val, np.integer):
            dtype = type(val)
        else:
            dtype = np.int64
    elif isinstance(val, (np.floating, float)):
        if isinstance(val, np.floating):
            dtype = type(val)
        else:
            dtype = np.float64
    elif isinstance(val, np.complexfloating):
        dtype = np.complex_
    elif isinstance(val, (str, np.object_)):
        dtype = np.object_
    elif pandas_dtype:
        if isinstance(val, (Timestamp, Timedelta)):
            dtype = np.dtype("M8[ns]")
        elif isinstance(val, (Period)):
            dtype = PeriodDtype(freq=val.freq)
            val = val.ordinal
    return dtype, val
```

In this corrected code, we have explicitly handled the cases for integers, float, complex, string, and pandas extension types like Timestamp, Timedelta, and Period. The dtype is inferred based on the input type, and the logic inside each conditional block handles the dtype inference correctly.
