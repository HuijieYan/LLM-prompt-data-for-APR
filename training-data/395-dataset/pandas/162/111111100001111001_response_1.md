The bug in the provided function seems to be located in the conditional handling for different normalize parameters. The condition is not properly checking for boolean values and there is a mismatch in the handling of true and false values.

The function appears to be designed to normalize a DataFrame according to the specified parameters, but it seems there are discrepancies in how the normalization is handled. This could lead to incorrect results during normalization.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to rewrite the conditional logic to correctly handle boolean values and assign the corresponding normalization strategy accordingly. The existing dictionary-based approach for normalization can be updated to accurately reflect the normalization logic.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _normalize(table, normalize, margins, margins_name="All"):
    
    if not isinstance(normalize, (bool, str)):
        axis_subs = {0: "index", 1: "columns"}
        try:
            normalize = axis_subs[normalize]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")
    
    if margins is False:
        normalizers = {
            "all": lambda x: x / x.values.sum(),
            "columns": lambda x: x.div(x.sum(), axis=1),
            "index": lambda x: x.div(x.sum(axis=1), axis=0),
        }
        
        if normalize is True:
            normalize = "all"
    
        try:
            f = normalizers[normalize]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")

        table = f(table)
        table = table.fillna(0)
    
    elif margins is True:
        column_margin = table.sum(axis=0)
        index_margin = table.sum(axis=1)
        table /= table.values.sum()
        
        for col in column_margin.index:
            table.loc[margins_name, col] = column_margin[col]
        for ind in index_margin.index:
            table.loc[ind, margins_name] = index_margin[ind]

    else:
        raise ValueError("Not a valid margins argument")
    
    return table
```

In this corrected function, the conditional handling has been revised to correctly manage boolean normalization parameters. Additionally, the normalization methods have been rewritten to ensure accurate normalization based on the specified parameters.
