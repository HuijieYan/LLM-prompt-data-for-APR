The bug occurs in the `_normalize` function due to issues with how margins and normalization are being handled together.

1. The test cases provided attempt to normalize and apply margins in a crosstab operation, but they are encountering errors due to the way margins and normalization are being handled inside the `_normalize` function.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional blocks that handle the `margins` and `normalize` parameters.

3. The bug occurs because there is no synchronization between the values of `margins` and `normalize` while applying normalization on the table. Additionally, the way the table is modified in the `margins is True` branch is not consistent with the expectation of the crosstab operation.

4. To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
    - Synchronize the `margins` and `normalize` parameters to ensure that they are compatible.
    - Make sure that the `margins_name` is handled properly and does not cause KeyError while applying margins in case normalize is True.
    - Update the logic of handling margins and normalization to align with the expected behavior of the crosstab operation.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_normalize` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _normalize(table, normalize, margins, margins_name="All"):
    if not isinstance(normalize, (bool, str)):
        axis_subs = {0: "index", 1: "columns"}
        try:
            normalize = axis_subs[normalize]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")

    if margins is True:
        table = table.div(table.sum().sum())
        if normalize == "columns":
            col_margin = table.sum(axis=0, min_count=1)
            table = pd.concat([table, col_margin.to_frame().T])
        elif normalize == "index":
            idx_margin = table.sum(axis=1, min_count=1)
            idx_margin.name = margins_name
            table = table.append(idx_margin)
        table.fillna(0, inplace=True)
        return table
    else:
        if normalize is True:
            normalize = "all"
        table = table.div(table.sum(axis=1), axis=0)
        return table.fillna(0)

    raise ValueError("Not a valid margins argument")
```

The corrected code provides a more straightforward normalization approach compatible with the crosstab operation and ensures that the margins are handled properly while applying normalization.
