The issue seems to be related to the subtraction of boolean values when using the `diff` function in pandas. The bug seems to be located in the section of code where the subtraction of arrays is performed (`out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]`). The error message suggests that it's not possible to subtract boolean values in the way it is being done in the current implementation.

The bug occurs because the current implementation is using direct subtraction to calculate the differences between boolean values. The expected behavior when subtracting boolean values is to treat `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, but this is not the behavior exhibited by the current implementation.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to bypass the direct subtraction of arrays and instead use the `np.diff` function, which is designed to calculate differences between elements of an array. Since the behavior of boolean subtraction in numpy is different from native Python, using `np.diff` should handle this properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    if not isinstance(arr, np.ndarray):
        arr = np.asarray(arr)

    return np.diff(arr, n=n, axis=axis)
```

This implementation uses `np.diff` to calculate the differences between elements, bypassing the direct subtraction of arrays and ensuring that boolean values are handled correctly.
