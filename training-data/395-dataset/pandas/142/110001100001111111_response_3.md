The issue is occurring in the diff function where it subtracts two numpy arrays. The problem arises when the numpy arrays contain boolean values. When the diff function encounters boolean values, it performs binary operations which are not in line with the expected behavior of native Python.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to use the np.diff function for the difference operation. Since np.diff treats booleans in binary operations, this could potentially resolve the issue and align the behavior with native Python subtraction for booleans.

Here's the corrected code for the diff function incorporating the use of np.diff:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n, axis=axis)

    return out_arr
```

By using np.diff directly, we can avoid the issue of boolean subtraction and achieve the expected behavior for the diff function.
