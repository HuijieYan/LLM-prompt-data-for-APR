Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the subtraction operation in the line `out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]`. The code tries to perform a subtraction on boolean dtype arrays, which is causing unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
Numpy treats boolean arrays differently in subtraction operations, which is different from native Python. This leads to unexpected behavior when performing subtraction on boolean arrays.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix the bug is to handle boolean arrays separately and perform a different type of subtraction based on their values. Another approach is to use a different method from numpy specifically designed for handling boolean arrays in subtraction operations.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    if arr.dtype == np.bool:
        # Handle boolean arrays separately
        result = np.where(arr, 1, 0) - np.where(np.roll(arr, n), 1, 0)
        return result.astype(np.bool)

    return np.diff(arr, n, axis)
```
