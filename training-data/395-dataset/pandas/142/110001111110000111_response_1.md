The error message indicates that there is a TypeError occurring at line 1963 in the `algorithms.py` file. The error occurs when subtracting boolean arrays using the `-` operator, which is not supported in numpy.

The potential error location is identified in the line:
```python
out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]
```
This is where the subtraction of boolean arrays is taking place, leading to the TypeError.

The bug occurs because the current implementation is trying to subtract boolean arrays directly using the `-` operator, which is not supported in numpy. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior of the `diff` method for boolean arrays.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use bitwise XOR or logical XOR operations instead of direct subtraction when working with boolean arrays. This aligns with the behavior of boolean arrays in Python and ensures consistent results with other operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = na

    if arr.ndim == 2 and arr.dtype.name in _diff_special:
        f = _diff_special[arr.dtype.name]
        f(arr, out_arr, n, axis)
    else:
        res = arr[na_indexer]
        lag = arr[lag_indexer]

        out_arr[res_indexer] = np.bitwise_xor(res, lag)  # bitwise XOR operation

    return out_arr
```
By using `np.bitwise_xor()` instead of direct subtraction, the corrected code aligns with the expected behavior for boolean arrays, thus fixing the bug.
