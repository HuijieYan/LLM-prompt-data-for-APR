Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the difference in the `else` block. Specifically, the line `out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]` is where the bug is occurring.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the code is attempting to perform arithmetic operations directly on boolean values, which is causing unexpected behavior due to the differences in how numpy treats boolean operations compared to native Python operations.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly convert the boolean values to integers (0 and 1) before performing the arithmetic operation to ensure consistent behavior.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    n = int(n)
    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n=n, axis=axis)

    return out_arr
```
