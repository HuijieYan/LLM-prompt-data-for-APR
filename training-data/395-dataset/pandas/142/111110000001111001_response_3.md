The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the way it handles boolean arrays and the datatype conversion for timedelta arrays.

The bug occurred because the function attempted to convert boolean arrays to object arrays, and then perform operations which are not valid for boolean arrays.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the boolean arrays differently and perform appropriate operations. Additionally, the function should handle the conversion to timedelta arrays properly if needed.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """
    
    na = np.nan
    out_arr = arr.copy()
    indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    indexer[axis] = slice(n, None) if n >= 0 else slice(None, n)
    lag_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    lag_indexer[axis] = slice(None, -n) if n > 0 else slice(-n, None)
    
    out_arr[indexer] -= out_arr[lag_indexer]

    return out_arr
```

This corrected code handles the boolean arrays and performs the shift operation correctly without the need for datatype conversions.
