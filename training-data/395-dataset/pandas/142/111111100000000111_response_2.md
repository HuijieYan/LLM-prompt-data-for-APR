The issue arises from the implementation of the `diff` function in the `algorithms.py` file of the `pandas` library. The `diff` function is designed to compute the difference of `n` between elements in an array, analogous to `s - s.shift(n)`.

The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `diff` function does not handle boolean values correctly. When `diff` is applied to a Series containing boolean values, it produces different results from native Python operations on boolean values.

The potential error location within the `diff` function is in the section that performs the subtraction of arrays:
```python
out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]
```
This line is where the boolean subtraction is occurring incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the `diff` function should be updated to properly handle boolean values. Instead of using direct array subtraction, the function should use bitwise operations or logical operations to handle boolean values correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """
    result = np.diff(arr, n=n, axis=axis)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we replace the manual subtraction with the `np.diff` function, which properly handles boolean values and provides the expected output.
