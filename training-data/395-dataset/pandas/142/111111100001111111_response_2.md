Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely occurring in the `diff` function at the line `out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]`. This line performs subtraction on boolean values, which is causing unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is happening because when performing operations with boolean arrays, numpy does not treat boolean values like Python native behavior. Instead, it replaces `False` with `0` and `True` with `1` during subtraction.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix this bug is to use native Python behavior for boolean values. Another approach could be to use the `np.diff` function, which treats boolean values differently than direct subtraction.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    if not isinstance(arr, np.ndarray):
        arr = np.asarray(arr)

    if arr.dtype == np.bool_:
        return np.diff(arr, n, axis)

    return arr - np.roll(arr, n, axis)
```
In the corrected code, we use the `np.diff` function for boolean arrays and normal subtraction for other types of arrays. This should provide the expected behavior for the `diff` function.
