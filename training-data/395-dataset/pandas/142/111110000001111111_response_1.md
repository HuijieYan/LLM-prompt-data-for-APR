The problem seems to be with the line `out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]` in the function `diff`. The bug occurs because the subtraction operation between two boolean arrays is done in a way that is different from native Python behavior.

The reason behind this bug is that the current implementation of `pd.Series.diff` subtracts two boolean arrays using the subtraction operator, which doesn't behave as expected when working with boolean values.

One approach to fixing this bug is to use the `np.diff` function to calculate the differences of the input array rather than manually subtracting the arrays. This will ensure that the behavior is consistent with the native Python behavior for boolean subtraction.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    return np.diff(arr, n, axis)
```
