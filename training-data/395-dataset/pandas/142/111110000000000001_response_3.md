Potential error location: The potential error locations are the if-else statements checking for the dtype of the input array 'arr' and the variable assignment for the datatype 'dtype'.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the function is trying to manipulate the dtype and data of the input array 'arr' based on certain conditions, but it is not handling all possible dtype cases and data types.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Improve the handling of different data types by considering all possible dtype cases and data types.
2. Use appropriate type conversions and data handling for different data types.
3. Streamline the dtype manipulation process to avoid conflicts.

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """
    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n, axis=axis)
    return out_arr
