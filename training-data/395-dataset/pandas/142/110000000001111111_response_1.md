The error occurs because the current implementation of the `diff` function in the `pandas` library uses direct subtraction of two NumPy arrays with boolean values. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, this behavior is counterintuitive and leads to unexpected results. The output of the `diff` function differs from the expected output of the native Python operations.

The potential error location within the `diff` function is the direct subtraction of boolean arrays:
```python
out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]
```

The subtraction of boolean arrays in NumPy does not follow the native Python behavior. Instead, NumPy treats True as 1 and False as 0 during subtraction, causing unexpected outcomes.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to revise the subtraction logic for boolean arrays. Treating boolean arrays as integers for subtraction is not desirable, so a custom subtraction logic needs to be implemented for boolean arrays.

A corrected version of the `diff` function that addresses this bug:
```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    is_timedelta = False
    if needs_i8_conversion(arr):
        dtype = np.float64
        arr = arr.view("i8")
        na = iNaT
        is_timedelta = True

    elif is_bool_dtype(dtype):
        dtype = np.object_

    elif is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        dtype = np.float64

    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = na

    if arr.dtype.type is np.bool_:
        shifted_arr = np.roll(arr, n, axis)
        out_arr = np.where(np.isnan(shifted_arr) | np.isnan(arr), na, shifted_arr != arr)

    if is_timedelta:
        out_arr = out_arr.astype("int64").view("timedelta64[ns]")

    return out_arr
```
In this corrected version, a custom logic is implemented for subtraction of boolean arrays by using NumPy's `np.where` function to create the shifted array and compare the values for the `diff` output. This will produce the expected behavior for boolean arrays in the `diff` function.
