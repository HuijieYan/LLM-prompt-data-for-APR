The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where the code checks if the dtype is a boolean. This section converts the dtype to np.object_, which may lead to unexpected behavior when performing arithmetic operations on the array.

The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly handling boolean dtype. When the dtype is a boolean, the code is converting it to np.object_, which can lead to issues when performing arithmetic operations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle boolean dtype in a different way. Instead of converting the dtype to np.object_, we can directly perform the arithmetic operations on the boolean arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan

    if arr.dtype == np.bool:
        out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=np.bool)
        out_arr[axis:] = arr[n:] ^ arr[:-n]

    else:
        dtype = arr.dtype

        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.datetime64) or np.issubdtype(dtype, np.timedelta64):
            return arr - np.roll(arr, n)

        out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)
        out_arr[axis:] = arr[n:] - arr[:-n]

    return out_arr
```

This corrected code handles boolean dtype separately and performs the XOR operation to obtain the difference array. For other data types, it uses the np.roll function to calculate the difference.
