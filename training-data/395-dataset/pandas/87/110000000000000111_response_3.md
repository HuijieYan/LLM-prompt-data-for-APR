The problem is occurring in the crosstab function, specifically in the part where the DataFrame is being created and the pivot_table is being used. The issue seems to be related to the column names when creating the DataFrame. The problem might be caused by the use of tuples as column names, which is not being handled correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the column names are correctly extracted from the series, and any tuples should be flattened into a single level. This can be achieved by iterating through the column names and converting any tuples into a single string.

Here is the corrected code for the crosstab function:

```python
def crosstab(
    index,
    columns,
    values=None,
    rownames=None,
    colnames=None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins=False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    # Extracting column names from the column series
    if isinstance(columns, list):
        colnames = [str(col) if not isinstance(col, tuple) else "_".join(col) for col in columns]
    else:
        colnames = [str(col) if not isinstance(col, tuple) else "_".join(col) for col in columns.values]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...
```
