The given test case `test_crosstab_both_tuple_names` creates two Series `s1` and `s2` and then compares the result of calling the `crosstab` function from the buggy code with the expected result using `tm.assert_frame_equal`.

The error message indicates that the issue lies in the comparison of the columns of the resulting DataFrame. Specifically, it states that the classes of the columns of the resulting DataFrame are not equivalent. This implies that there is an issue with the structure of the resulting DataFrame that causes it to have different classes for the columns compared to the expected DataFrame.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the code that constructs the resulting DataFrame from the `pivot_table` method.

The bug is caused by the way the column names are assigned in the DataFrame returned by the `pivot_table` method. The code fails to correctly handle the case where the index and columns passed to the crosstab function are tuples. As a result, the resulting DataFrame does not have the expected column structure.

To fix the bug, the code for constructing the resulting DataFrame should be updated to correctly handle the case where the index and columns are tuples.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def crosstab(
    index,
    columns,
    values=None,
    rownames=None,
    colnames=None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins=False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    # Construct MultiIndex for columns if colnames is specified
    if isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)):
        col_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(columns, names=colnames)
    else:
        col_index = pd.Index(columns, name=colnames)

    # Construct MultiIndex for rows if rownames is specified
    if isinstance(index, (list, tuple)):
        row_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(index, names=rownames)
    else:
        row_index = pd.Index(index, name=rownames)

    # Create the DataFrame with the correct row and column indices
    df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=row_index, columns=col_index)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles the case where the passed index and columns are tuples, constructing the correct MultiIndex for the resulting DataFrame.
