Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_on` function of the `Rolling` class as it is responsible for determining the index to be used for the rolling operation.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `on` attribute within the `_on` function. When using a DatetimeIndex as the column index, the function is not properly handling the offset specified for the rolling window.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the offset specified is valid for a DatetimeIndex and handle it accordingly.
2. Evaluate the condition for rolling with a DatetimeIndex as the column and adjust the behavior accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class Rolling(_Rolling_and_Expanding):
    # ... omitted code ...

    @cache_readonly
    def _on(self):
    
        if self.on is None:
            return self.obj.index
        elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
            if isinstance(self.obj.columns, pd.DatetimeIndex) and isinstance(self.window, str) and self.window.endswith('d'):
                return self.obj.index
            else:
                return Index(self.obj[self.on])
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "invalid on specified as {0}, "
                "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
                "or None".format(self.on)
            )
```
In the corrected code, the `_on` function checks if the column index is a DatetimeIndex and if the window is specified as a string ending with 'd', indicating a day-based offset. If both conditions are met, it returns the index of the DataFrame. Otherwise, it returns the index based on the specified column.
