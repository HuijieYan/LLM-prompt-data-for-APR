The buggy function is a method that is meant to handle different types of input data and return a specific value based on the input. The function is designed to work with a `Rolling` object and a `DataFrame` object. However, the function has some issues with handling the `self.obj` input, as the function has a condition that checks if the input is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, but it doesn't handle the different types of `DatetimeIndex` that may be present in the `DataFrame` object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle different types of `DatetimeIndex` in the `DataFrame` object. We should specifically check for the type of `DatetimeIndex` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_any_dtype as is_datetime

def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif is_datetime(self.obj.index) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return self.obj[self.on]
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

In the corrected function, we use the `is_datetime` function to specifically check if the index of the DataFrame is a `DatetimeIndex`. If it is, we proceed to check if the specified column exists in the DataFrame. If the conditions are not met, we raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.

This modification will ensure that the function handles different types of `DatetimeIndex` properly and returns the expected results.
