The issue seems to be related to using a DatetimeIndex in the columns and specifying an offset for `df.rolling` which results in a ValueError. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if self.on is None:` condition. This condition is checking if the 'on' attribute is None, but this check may not be sufficient for handling the case where a DatetimeIndex is used in the columns.

The bug occurs because when a DatetimeIndex is used in the columns, specifying an offset for `df.rolling` does not work and gives a ValueError. This is likely due to the condition `if self.on is None:` not handling this case properly.

One approach to fixing this bug is to explicitly check if the object's index is a DatetimeIndex, and if so, handle the rolling window calculation accordingly. If the index is not a DatetimeIndex, then the existing logic can be used.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class Rolling(_Rolling_and_Expanding):
    # ... omitted code ...

    @cache_readonly
    def _on(self):
        if self.on is None:
            if isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                return Index(self.obj.index)
            else:
                return self.obj.index
        elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "invalid on specified as {0}, "
                "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
                "or None".format(self.on)
            )
```

By explicitly checking if the index is a DatetimeIndex and handling it differently, this should address the issue of using a DatetimeIndex in the columns when specifying an offset for `df.rolling`.
