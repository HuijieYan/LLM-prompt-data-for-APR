Potential error location: The error could be in the condition `isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame)`, which is attempting to check if `self.obj` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, but the `ABCDataFrame` class is not defined.

Reason for the bug: The `ABCDataFrame` class is not defined, so the `isinstance()` check will always fail, resulting in the `else` block being executed and raising a `ValueError`.

Approach for fixing the bug: Since it's not clear what `ABCDataFrame` is supposed to represent, I will assume that it's meant to be a representation of a DataFrame from a specific library. So, I will replace `ABCDataFrame` with the actual class name of the DataFrame object.

Corrected code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, pd.DataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return pd.Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```
