The error is likely related to the `rolling` function call in the test case provided. The error message "ValueError: window must be an integer" suggests that the `rolling` function is expecting an integer as the window size, but it's receiving something else.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that handles the input `self.on`. This is because the error message mentions "invalid on specified as {0}", which indicates that the problem might be related to the `self.on` parameter.

The reason for the bug is likely that the function `_on` is not handling the input `self.on` correctly and is not returning the correct value that the `rolling` function expects.

To fix the bug, the `_on` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the different cases based on the value of `self.on`. It should validate the input and return the appropriate result according to the logic specified in the test case and the requirements of the `rolling` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_on` function:

```python
# This is the corrected function
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, pd.DataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return self.obj[self.on]
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `Index` object has been removed and instead, it returns `self.obj[self.on]` directly if the conditions are met. This should address the issue and allow the `rolling` function to work correctly with the specified input.
