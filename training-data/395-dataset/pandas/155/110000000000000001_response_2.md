The potential error in the provided code is the missing implementation of the function decorator `@cache_readonly`.

The bug occurs because the `@cache_readonly` decorator is missing, and it seems like it is a custom decorator that should be used to cache the output of the function to avoid redundant computation. Because of this missing decorator, the code will not work as intended, and the caching mechanism will not be applied.

To fix the bug, we need to implement the `@cache_readonly` decorator. Here's the corrected function/method:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

def cache_readonly(func):
    @property
    @lru_cache()
    def wrapper(self):
        return func(self)
    return wrapper

@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

In the corrected code, we define a custom `cache_readonly` decorator that uses the `functools.lru_cache` decorator to cache the output of the `_on` function. Then, we decorate the `_on` function with `@cache_readonly` to apply the caching mechanism.
