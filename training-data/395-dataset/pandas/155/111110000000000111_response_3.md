Based on the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to using a DatetimeIndex for the columns in a DataFrame with the rolling function. The error message "ValueError: window must be an integer" suggests that there is an issue with the window parameter not being accepted as an offset when a DatetimeIndex is used for the columns.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `self.on` parameter. The function checks if `self.on` is None or if it is in the columns of the DataFrame, but it does not handle the case when an offset is provided.

The bug occurs because the function does not have the capability to handle DatetimeIndex in the columns and to accept an offset for the rolling function.

To fix the bug, the function `_on` should be updated to properly handle the case when an offset is provided for DatetimeIndex in the columns. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional statements to include a check for offset values and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Rolling(_Rolling_and_Expanding):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _on(self):
    
        if self.on is None:
            return self.obj.index
        elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
        elif isinstance(self.on, str):
            return self.on  # handle offset values
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "invalid on specified as {0}, "
                "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
                "or None".format(self.on)
            )
```

This update allows the function to handle the case when an offset is provided for DataFrame with DatetimeIndex in the columns and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
