The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with setting the name on a level of a MultiIndex. This suggests that the bug may be in the `_get_grouper_for_level` method, which involves manipulation of the MultiIndex levels and codes.

The error occurs because the method `_get_grouper_for_level` is performing operations that lead to incorrect results and mismatch between the expected and actual output. This is caused by inappropriate data manipulation and inconsistency in the data structures such as arrays and indexes.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the level, indexer, level_index, grouper, codes, uniques, and other related variables are used and manipulated correctly to produce the expected results.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        # Handle group mapping function and return
        level_values = level_index.take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    unique_levels = np.unique(indexer)  # Find unique levels in the indexer

    # Create a mask of valid codes (not equal to -1)
    mask = indexer != -1

    # Get the unique values from the indexer that are not equal to -1
    ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

    # Reconstruct the codes array and replace -1 with valid codes
    codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
    codes[mask] = ok_codes
    codes[~mask] = -1

    # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
    level_index = level_index.take(uniques)

    # If there are any levels present, use take to map the codes to level_index
    grouper = level_index.take(codes) if len(level_index) else level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True)

    return grouper, codes, level_index
```

The corrected code includes the changes mentioned above to ensure that the manipulation of variables and data structures is taking place as intended. This should address the issues and correctly return the expected result.
