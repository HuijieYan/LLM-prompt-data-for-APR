The error message indicates that there is an issue with setting the name on a level of a MultiIndex, which suggests that the bug is related to the handling of MultiIndex levels in the `_get_grouper_for_level` function.

The problem seems to be related to the way the function is handling the MultiIndex levels and codes when applying a group mapping function. There may be an issue with how the grouper, codes, and level index are being calculated and returned.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the MultiIndex levels and codes are handled correctly when applying a group mapping function. This may involve checking the logic for translating the group mapping function to the level values and ensuring that the correct level indices are used for grouping.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper_for_level` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["_get_grouper_for_level"])
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        # Handle group mapping function and return
        level_values = level_index.take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
        # Handle NAs
        mask = indexer != -1
        ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

        codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
        codes[mask] = ok_codes
        codes[~mask] = -1

    if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
        # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
        level_index = level_index[np.in1d(level_index, uniques)]

    if len(level_index):
        grouper = level_index.take(codes)
    else:
        grouper = level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True)

    return grouper, codes, level_index
```

In this corrected code, I made the following changes:
1. Updated the logic for handling group mapping function to ensure that it correctly translates to the level values.
2. Modified the logic for removing unobserved levels from level_index to use `np.in1d` for better handling of the boolean mask.
3. Ensured that the correct level_index is used for grouping by directly updating the level_index with only the observed levels.

These changes aim to address the issues with MultiIndex levels and codes handling and should prevent the RuntimeError related to setting the name on a level of a MultiIndex.
