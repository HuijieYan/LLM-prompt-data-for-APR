There seems to be a bug in the `_get_grouper_for_level` method of the `MultiIndex` class, which is causing a `RuntimeError` when the `test_apply_multi_level_name` function is executed. The error occurs when the `name` attribute is attempted to be set for the `key_index` object.

The potential error location is within the `_get_grouper_for_level` method, where the method tries to perform some operations related to creating a grouper for a particular level. It seems that the error is likely related to the creation of the `grouper` and `level_index` objects inside the method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to an incorrect implementation of the logic for creating the `grouper` and `level_index` objects, which is causing an issue when attempting to set the `name` attribute for them.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to review and refactor the logic inside the `_get_grouper_for_level` method, ensuring that the creation of the `grouper` and `level_index` objects is handled correctly, and any necessary attributes are set appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper_for_level` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["_get_grouper_for_level"])
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        # Handle group mapping function and return
        level_values = level_index.take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
        # Handle NAs
        mask = indexer != -1
        ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

        codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
        codes[mask] = ok_codes
        codes[~mask] = -1

    if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
        # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
        level_index = level_index.take(uniques)

    if len(level_index):
        grouper = level_index.take(codes)
    else:
        grouper = level_index.take(codes, allow_fill=True, fill_value=True)

    return grouper, codes, level_index
```

In the corrected code, some adjustments have been made to ensure that the `grouper` and `level_index` objects are created and handled correctly, with the appropriate attributes set. This should resolve the `RuntimeError` issue that was occurring.
