The error message indicates a runtime error where the name of the level of a MultiIndex is being set, which is not allowed. The error occurs in the `pandas/core/indexes/base.py` file. 

Looking at the function `_get_grouper_for_level`, it seems there might be a problem with how the `level_index` is being handled or manipulated. The function might be incorrectly setting the name of the level of the MultiIndex, leading to the runtime error.

The bug occurs because the function `_get_grouper_for_level` is trying to set the name of the level of a MultiIndex, which is not allowed. This happens when the function is manipulating the `level_index` and `grouper` variables.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function does not attempt to set the name of the level of a MultiIndex. This can be done by checking the code that handles the `level_index` and `grouper` variables and making sure that it does not involve setting the name of the level.

```python
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        level_values = self.levels[level].take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = pd.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
        mask = indexer != -1
        ok_codes, uniques = pd.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

        codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
        codes[mask] = ok_codes
        codes[~mask] = -1

    if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
        level_index = level_index.take(uniques)

    if len(level_index):
        return level_index.take(codes), codes, level_index
    else:
        return level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True), codes, level_index
```

In this corrected code, the line `level_index.take(codes)` has been changed to `return level_index.take(codes), codes, level_index` to ensure that the name of the level of a MultiIndex is not being set. Additionally, the `pd.` prefix has been added to the `factorize` function to ensure that the correct function is being called.
