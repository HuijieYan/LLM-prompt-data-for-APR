The test case `test_apply_multi_level_name` is attempting to group the DataFrame `df` by the 'B' column, and then apply the `sum` function to each group. However, the error message indicates that there is a problem with setting the name on a level of a MultiIndex.

The error occurs in the `_wrap_applied_output` method of the `groupby.py` file, where it tries to set the name of the index to 'B'. This suggests that the problem originates from the function being used to group the DataFrame.

Upon analyzing the error, it seems that the issue might be related to the `_get_grouper_for_level` function. The error message indicates that the name of the index cannot be set on a level of a MultiIndex. This suggests that there might be a problem with how the function is handling the groupers and levels of the MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper_for_level` function should be modified to ensure that it handles MultiIndex groupers and levels properly. Since the error seems to be related to setting the name on a level of a MultiIndex, it is important to review the logic within the function to ensure that the name is handled correctly.

Here's a possible correction for the function:

```python
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        level_values = self.levels[level].take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

In this corrected version of the function, the focus is on ensuring that the level names and groupers are handled appropriately for MultiIndex cases.

After applying this correction, the test case `test_apply_multi_level_name` should no longer encounter the error related to setting the name on a level of a MultiIndex.
