```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and key in obj.columns:
        key = [key]  # Convert single column key to list
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```
Note: The above is a partial solution to address the specific issue mentioned in the GitHub issue. This solution modifies the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case where the `key` is a single column name and the `axis` is 1 (grouping by columns). This modification allows the function to correctly handle the case described in the GitHub issue, but additional testing and review may be needed for other use cases and potential side effects.
