The error occurs in the `_get_grouper` function when the `groupby` method is called with the `axis=1` argument. It fails to group by columns when `group_name` is a list, such as `["x"]`.

The issue appears to be happening in the part of the code that handles the `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions, which are used to determine whether the passed group name is related to the index or the columns.

The current logic does not account for the scenario when `group_name` is a list, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access the grouped values. 

To fix this issue, the `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` functions should be modified to handle the case when `group_name` is a list. Additionally, the logic for handling group names should be updated to properly handle both single values and lists.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (previous implementation)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # If group_name is a list, iterate over each element and process it individually
        groupings = []
        exclusions = []

        for k in key:
            g, e = _get_grouper(obj, key=k, axis=axis, level=level, sort=sort, observed=observed, mutated=mutated, validate=False)
            groupings.append(g)
            exclusions.extend(e)

        # create the internals grouper
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, exclusions, obj

    # ... (remaining code)
```

The modification allows the `_get_grouper` function to handle the case when `group_name` is a list, effectively grouping by multiple columns as expected. This correction ensures that the function can handle both single values and lists as input for the `key` parameter, allowing for grouping by columns when `group_name` is a list.
