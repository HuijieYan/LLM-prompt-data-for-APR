Potential error location: The potential error location is in the `level` and `group_axis` conditions. There are multiple conditions and checks within these blocks which may be leading to incorrect behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may occur due to the inconsistent handling of 'level' and 'group_axis' under different conditions, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the conditions and checks to make the code more readable and easier to understand.
2. Ensure that the conditions for 'level' and 'group_axis' are handled consistently and logically.
3. Refactor the code to remove any unnecessary or duplicated checks and conditions.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.core.index import MultiIndex

def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Simplified the checking conditions for level and group_axis
    if level is not None and isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
        # Handle conditions related to MultiIndex
        if is_list_like(level) and len(level) == 1:
            level = level[0]
        
        if key is None and is_scalar(level):
            key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
            level = None
    else:
        if is_list_like(level):
            nlevels = len(level)
            if nlevels == 1:
                level = level[0]
            elif nlevels == 0:
                raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

        if isinstance(level, str):
            if obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )
        elif level > 0 or level < -1:
            raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

        level = None
        key = group_axis

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the checking conditions for 'level' and 'group_axis' have been simplified and aligned to ensure consistent handling of these parameters. The other parts of the function remain unchanged.
