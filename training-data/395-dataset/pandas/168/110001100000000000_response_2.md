        create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
        mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
        This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
        multiple groupers
    
        Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
        index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers
    
        Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
        the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.
    
        This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
        are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
        a BaseGrouper.
    
        If observed & we have a categorical grouper, only show the observed
        values
