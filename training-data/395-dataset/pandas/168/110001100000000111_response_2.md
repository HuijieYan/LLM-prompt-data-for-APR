The error occurs when using the `groupby` method with the `axis=1` parameter to group by column names. This leads to a `KeyError` even though the intention is to group by columns. This behavior is not consistent with the documentation, which implies that grouping by columns should work using the `by` parameter with `axis=1`.

The potential error location within the problematic function `_get_grouper` is when checking the presence of the key in the axis or object. This check may not be handling column names properly, leading to the `KeyError` when attempting to group by columns.

To fix this bug, you can adjust the logic for checking the presence of the key in the axis or object, especially when dealing with column names. Also, ensure that the logic for grouping by columns matches the documentation and intended behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # Code to handle level and key logic
    # ... (remaining code) ...

    # Check if grouping by columns
    if axis == 1:
        key = key if key is not None else obj.columns

    # New logic to handle grouping by columns
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if (
        axis == 1
        and isinstance(key, list)
        and all(k in obj.columns for k in key)
    ):
        match_axis_length = len(key) == len(group_axis)

    # Logic to handle grouping on axis
    if axis == 1 and match_axis_length and level is None:
        if isinstance(obj, DataFrame):
            all_in_columns_index = all(
                g in obj.columns or g in obj.index.names for g in key
            )
        elif isinstance(obj, Series):
            all_in_columns_index = all(g in obj.index.names for g in key)

        if not all_in_columns_index:
            key = [com.asarray_tuplesafe(key)]

    # ... (remaining code) ...

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In the corrected code, the logic is adjusted to handle grouping by columns when `axis=1`. The code checks if grouping by columns and adjusts the key accordingly. This modification ensures consistent behavior for grouping by columns based on the provided `key` parameter.
