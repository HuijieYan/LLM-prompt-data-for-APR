The function `_get_grouper` appears to have a bug, as the condition where `level` is not `None` and `is_list_like(level)` is true results in the variable `level` being reassigned to the first element of the list, without considering the case where `level` is a string. This results in unexpected behavior when processing the input.

The bug occurs due to the conditional check `if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex)` not appropriately handling the case where `level` is a string. This condition should be modified to address the appropriate handling of `MultiIndex` instances and string levels.

To fix this bug, the condition should be updated to properly handle the different cases for `level` based on its type and the `MultiIndex` instance.

Below is the corrected function `_get_grouper`:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    The corrected _get_grouper method
    """
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    # validate that the passed single level is compatible with the passed
    # axis of the object
    if level is not None:
        if isinstance(level, list):
            if len(level) == 1:
                level = level[0]
            else:
                raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if key is None and is_scalar(level):
                # Get the level values from group_axis
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
            else:
                if level not in group_axis.names:
                    raise ValueError(
                        "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                    )
        else:
            # The group_axis and group_axis.get_level_values(level) are the same in this section.
            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # rest of the code ...

```
The corrected function now properly handles the different cases for `level` based on its type and the `MultiIndex` instance, ensuring that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios.
