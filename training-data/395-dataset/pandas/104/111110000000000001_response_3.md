The potential error location within the problematic function is the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions. These functions are currently defined within the `quantile` method, but they should be defined as class methods to be accessed by other methods in the class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions are defined as local functions within the `quantile` method, making them inaccessible to other methods in the class.

To fix the bug, the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions need to be defined as class methods. Additionally, the `self` parameter needs to be added to these methods to access instance attributes and methods.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method with the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions defined as class methods:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class GroupBy(_GroupBy):
    """
    Class for grouping and aggregating relational data.
    ...
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _get_cythonized_result(self, how: str, cython_dtype: np.dtype, aggregate: bool = False, needs_values: bool = False, needs_mask: bool = False, needs_ngroups: bool = False, result_is_index: bool = False, pre_processing=None, post_processing=None, **kwargs):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    @classmethod
    def pre_processor(cls, vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        if pd.api.types.is_object_dtype(vals):
            raise TypeError("'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!")

        inference = None
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(vals):
            inference = np.int64
        elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(vals):
            inference = "datetime64[ns]"
            vals = vals.astype(np.float)

        return vals, inference

    @classmethod
    def post_processor(cls, vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        if inference:
            # Check for edge case
            if not (pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(inference) and interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}):
                vals = vals.astype(inference)

        return vals

    # this is the corrected function
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
        """
        Return group values at the given quantile, a la numpy.percentile.
        ...
    """
    # ... rest of the code ...

```
