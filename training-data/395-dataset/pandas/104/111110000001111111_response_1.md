The issue with the `quantile` function is that it is throwing an `AssertionError` while using large dataframes and when `q` is an array-like input, indicating that the problem is with the calculation of indices and results where an assertion is failing. This means that the length of `indices` and `result` arrays are not matching.

The issue likely occurs during the `concat` operation and the subsequent reindexing and order fixing within the function, when `q` is an array-like input.

To fix this issue, the approach should involve ensuring that the indices and the results match in length after the `concat` operation and subsequent operations. This might involve rechecking the logic around index manipulation after the `concat` operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    # ... other codes ...
    if is_scalar(q):
        return self._get_cythonized_result(
            "group_quantile",
            aggregate=True,
            needs_values=True,
            needs_mask=True,
            cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
            pre_processing=pre_processor,
            post_processing=post_processor,
            q=q,
            interpolation=interpolation,
        )
    else:
        results = [
            self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=pre_processor,
                post_processing=post_processor,
                q=qi,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
            for qi in q
        ]
        result = concat(results, axis=0, keys=q)
        result = result.stack(0).loc[pd.IndexSlice[:, ..., q], :]
        return result
    # ... other codes ...
```

In the corrected code, the logic for fixing order and reindexing has been removed and replaced with a simplified approach to fix the dimensions mismatch issue.
