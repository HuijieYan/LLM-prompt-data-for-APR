The error occurs when the `quantile` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` object is called with an array-like `q` parameter. The error message states that an `AssertionError` is raised at line 1954 of the `groupby.py` file, indicating a discrepancy in the length of indices and the result.

The issue is likely occurring in the `quantile` method, particularly in the logic where the `result` is constructed and processed in case `q` is not a scalar. This discrepancy occurs because the logic for calculating the indices is flawed, leading to the assertion error.

To fix this bug, consider revising the logic for constructing the result and calculating the indices. Ensure that the constructions of `result` and `indices` are aligned properly. This might involve modifying how the result is constructed and how the indices are calculated based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    # existing code

    if np.isscalar(q):
        result = self._get_cythonized_result(
            "group_quantile",
            aggregate=True,
            needs_values=True,
            needs_mask=True,
            cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
            pre_processing=pre_processor,
            post_processing=post_processor,
            q=q,
            interpolation=interpolation,
        )
        return result
    else:
        results = [
            self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=pre_processor,
                post_processing=post_processor,
                q=qi,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
            for qi in q
        ]
        result = pd.concat(results, keys=q)
        result = result.stack(0).loc[pd.IndexSlice[:, q], :].unstack()
        return result
```

In this corrected version, the `result` is constructed and processed differently when `q` is not a scalar. The `concat` function is used to concatenate the results, and then `stack`, `loc`, and `unstack` are applied to properly handle multi-level indexing.
