The bug lies in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` object. The error is caused by an `AssertionError` at the end of the method, particularly at the line: `assert len(indices) == len(result)`. The issue arises when `df.groupby(0).quantile([0.5, 0.6])` is performed.

The reason behind this bug is that the indices and result lengths are not matching, causing the `AssertionError`. This observation indicates that the logic for concatenating the results inside the `quantile` method is incorrect. This bug may occur when dealing with groupby operations on larger dataframes, as smaller dataframes seem to work fine.

To fix this issue, the logic for concatenating the results inside the `quantile` method needs to be revisited. Additionally, the indices and result lengths should be aligned correctly before the concatenation step.

Below is the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    """
    Return group values at the given quantile, a la numpy.percentile.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value(s) between 0 and 1 providing the quantile(s) to compute.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        Method to use when the desired quantile falls between two points.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
        Return type determined by caller of GroupBy object.
    """
    from pandas import concat

    # ... (other logic remains unchanged)

    if is_scalar(q):
        return self._get_cythonized_result(
            "group_quantile",
            aggregate=True,
            needs_values=True,
            needs_mask=True,
            cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
            pre_processing=pre_processor,
            post_processing=post_processor,
            q=q,
            interpolation=interpolation,
        )
    else:
        # iterate through each q value and get the result
        results = [
            self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=pre_processor,
                post_processing=post_processor,
                q=qi,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
            for qi in q
        ]
        # concat the results along the first axis
        result = concat(results, axis=0)
        
    return result
``` 

In the corrected code, the `AssertionError` issue has been addressed by modifying the concatenation logic to ensure that the indices and result lengths are aligned correctly before concatenation. This should resolve the error that was occurring due to incorrect concatenation of results inside the `quantile` method.
