The key issue in the `quantile` function is the assertion error that occurs when trying to concatenate the `arrays` and compare the lengths of `indices` and `result`.

The cause of the bug is that, when the function is called with an array-like `q` and a DataFrame containing non-integer columns, it fails to correctly concatenate the arrays. Specifically, the issue arises from the `indices` array being concatenated from `arrays`, and the length of `indices` not matching the length of `result`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to rethink the logic for generating `indices` and how it relates to the `results` obtained from the group quantile calculations.

Here is the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    # ... existing code ...

    if is_scalar(q):
        return self._get_cythonized_result(
            "group_quantile",
            aggregate=True,
            needs_values=True,
            needs_mask=True,
            cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
            pre_processing=pre_processor,
            post_processing=post_processor,
            q=q,
            interpolation=interpolation,
        )
    else:
        results = [
            self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=pre_processor,
                post_processing=post_processor,
                q=qi,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
            for qi in q
        ]
        result = concat(results, axis=1, keys=q, names=[None, 'q'])
        return result
```

In this corrected code, the `concat` function is used with `axis=1` to concatenate the results along the columns, and the `keys` parameter is set to `q` to ensure the appropriate correlation between the `result` and `indices`.

With this corrected code, the `quantile` function should be able to handle array-like `q` gracefully and avoid the assertion error.
