The issue with the buggy function is that it defines the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions inside the `quantile` method, making them inaccessible outside the method scope. This results in a `NameError` when the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions are called.

To fix this issue, move the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions outside the `quantile` method and update their signatures to match the original function signatures. Additionally, remove the redefinition of the `_get_cythonized_result` method inside the `GroupBy` class, as it's already defined outside the class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Buggy function source code
# ... (previous code remains the same)

# move pre_processor and post_processor function outside the quantile method
def pre_processor(vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
    if is_object_dtype(vals):
        raise TypeError(
            "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!"
        )

    inference = None
    if is_integer_dtype(vals):
        inference = np.int64
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(vals):
        inference = "datetime64[ns]"
        vals = vals.astype(np.float)

    return vals, inference


def post_processor(vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
    if inference:
        # Check for edge case
        if not (
            is_integer_dtype(inference)
            and interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}
        ):
            vals = vals.astype(inference)

    return vals

# Define the GroupBy class
class GroupBy(_GroupBy):
    """
    ... (previous code remains the same)
    """

    # Remove the redefinition of _get_cythonized_result method

    def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
        """
        ... (previous code remains the same)
        """
```

With these changes, the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions will be in the global scope and accessible within the `quantile` method, resolving the `NameError` issue.
