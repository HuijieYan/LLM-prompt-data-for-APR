The problematic function `quantile` is currently referencing the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions as local functions inside the `quantile` function. However, it should be referencing the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions defined as attributes of the class `GroupBy`. This is because these functions are also defined as attributes of the class, not as local functions within the `quantile` function.

To fix the bug, the references to `pre_processor` and `post_processor` within the `quantile` function need to be updated to properly reference the class attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
# ... (other code)

class GroupBy(_GroupBy):
    # ... (other code)

    def pre_processor(self, vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        if is_object_dtype(vals):
            raise TypeError(
                "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!"
            )

        inference = None
        if is_integer_dtype(vals):
            inference = np.int64
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(vals):
            inference = "datetime64[ns]"
            vals = vals.astype(np.float)

        return vals, inference

    def post_processor(self, vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        if inference:
            # Check for edge case
            if not (
                is_integer_dtype(inference)
                and self.interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}
            ):
                vals = vals.astype(inference)

        return vals

    def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
        """
        Rest of the function remains unchanged
        """
```

In the corrected code, the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions are defined as part of the `GroupBy` class and accessed using `self`. This will ensure that the correct functions are referenced within the `quantile` function.
