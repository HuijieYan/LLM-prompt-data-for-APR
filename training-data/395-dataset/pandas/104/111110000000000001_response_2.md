The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'pre_processor' and 'post_processor' functions. The 'pre_processor' function is defined without the 'self' parameter, which is necessary since this function is within a class.

The bug occurs because the 'pre_processor' and 'post_processor' functions are defined as standalone functions within the class instead of being defined as methods of the class. As a result, they do not have access to the class instance via the 'self' parameter.

To fix the bug, the 'pre_processor' and 'post_processor' functions should be defined as methods of the class, so they have access to the class instance through the 'self' parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class GroupBy(_GroupBy):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def pre_processor(self, vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype, is_integer_dtype, is_datetime64_dtype
        inference = None
        if is_object_dtype(vals):
            raise TypeError(
                "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!"
            )
        if is_integer_dtype(vals):
            inference = np.int64
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(vals):
            inference = "datetime64[ns]"
            vals = vals.astype(np.float)
    
        return vals, inference
    
    def post_processor(self, vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        from pandas.api.types import is_integer_dtype
        if inference:
            # Check for edge case
            if not (is_integer_dtype(inference) and self.interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}):
                vals = vals.astype(inference)
    
        return vals
    
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
        """
        Return group values at the given quantile, a la numpy.percentile.
        ...
        (rest of the code remains unchanged)
        """

    # ... omitted code ...
```

In the corrected code, the 'pre_processor' and 'post_processor' functions are defined as methods of the 'GroupBy' class, and the 'self' parameter is used to refer to the class instance within these methods.
