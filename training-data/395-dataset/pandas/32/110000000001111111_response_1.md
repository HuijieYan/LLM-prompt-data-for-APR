The error in the code is likely occurring at this line:

```python
contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
```

The reason for the bug is that the `contents` variable is already in bytes format, so trying to encode it again is causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is already a bytes object, and avoid unnecessary encoding. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
    elif isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, bytes):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)  # Use BytesIO directly
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        try:
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        except UnicodeEncodeError:
            pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

In this corrected code, we check if `filepath_or_buffer` is a bytes object before creating the `self.filepath_or_buffer` attribute, and directly use BytesIO to write the bytes data to a buffer if it's a bytes object. This avoids the unnecessary encoding logic from the original code and should fix the bug.
