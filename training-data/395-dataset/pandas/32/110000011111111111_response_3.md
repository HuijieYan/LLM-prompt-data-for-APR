The error message "AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'" is occurring when trying to encode the contents of the file. This error suggests that the `contents` variable is of type bytes, and the `encode` method is not defined for bytes objects.

To fix this bug, the `if` condition checking for a string or bytes type is outdated. There is now an `io` module in Python that allows you to open files and create file-like objects. We will modify the `__init__` function to use the `io` module to create a file-like object for reading.

Here's the corrected code for the function `__init__`:

```python
# New fixed __init__ function
import io

def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, bytes):
        filepath_or_buffer = io.BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)

    self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

With this modification, the function can handle the file-like object passed as the `filepath_or_buffer` argument. It handles both string and bytes input and creates a `BytesIO` object if passed bytes, ensuring that the `encode` method is not called inappropriately.

This should resolve the issue encountered in the test function and the associated GitHub issue related to reading files using GCSFS.
