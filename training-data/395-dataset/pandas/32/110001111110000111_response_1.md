The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to encode a bytes object. This occurs in the `__init__` function of the `XportReader` class in the `pandas/io/sas/sas_xport.py` file. 

The error occurs because the `filepath_or_buffer` argument is a file object (`_io.BufferedReader`), and when trying to encode its content, an AttributeError is raised.

To fix this bug, we should modify the way the file content is handled. Instead of trying to encode the content, we should directly pass it to the `BytesIO` constructor to create a file-like object for reading binary data.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `XportReader` class:

```python
from io import BytesIO

class XportReader:
    # ... other methods ...

    def __init__(self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None):
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize

        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            filepath_or_buffer, encoding, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

        if hasattr(filepath_or_buffer, 'read'):  # Check if it's a file-like object
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer.read())
        else:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")

        self._read_header()
```

By using `BytesIO` to create a file-like object from the content of the file, we can ensure no encoding errors occur and that the data is handled correctly.

This fix should resolve the AttributeError and allow the `read_sas` function to work correctly when passing a file object from GCSFS (Google Cloud Storage File System).
