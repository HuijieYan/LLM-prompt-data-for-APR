The error message indicates that the `encode` method is being called on a `bytes` object, which is not allowed. The problematic function is the `__init__` function within the `XportReader` class. The issue arises from the following block of code:

```python
contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
try:
    contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
except UnicodeEncodeError:
    pass
self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
```

The `contents` variable is being read as a byte object and then being encoded, which is causing the AttributeError. 

To fix this bug, the `contents` should be decoded instead of encoded, as it is already in bytes format. The `BytesIO` should then be initialized with the decoded content.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Decode the contents instead of encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read().decode(self._encoding)
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
``` 
With this correction, the `contents` will be decoded from bytes and then initialized in `BytesIO`. This should resolve the AttributeError.
