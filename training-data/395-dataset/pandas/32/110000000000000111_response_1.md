The error message "AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'" indicates that the code is trying to call the encode method on a bytes object, which is not supported. This suggests that the file is being read as bytes instead of a string.

The potential error location is in the part of the function where it handles the filepath_or_buffer input. It attempts to check if the input is a string or bytes, but it doesn't properly handle the case when it's a file object.

The bug occurs because the code assumes that filepath_or_buffer will only be a string or bytes, and it does not handle file objects properly. When using GCSFS to open a file, it returns a file object instead of a string or bytes, causing this issue.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case when filepath_or_buffer is a file object. It should correctly read the contents of the file and handle the encoding based on the input.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Read the contents from the file object
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read().decode(self._encoding)
        self.filepath_or_buffer = io.StringIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```
