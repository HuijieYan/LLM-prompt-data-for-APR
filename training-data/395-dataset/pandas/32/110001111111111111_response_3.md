The error occurs in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class, specifically in the section where the `contents` variable is being encoded with the specified encoding. The error message indicates that the 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode', suggesting that the `contents` variable is already of type 'bytes', and attempting to encode it again is causing the error.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the content encoding based on its type. If it's already of type 'bytes', then no additional encoding is necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        # Check if filepath_or_buffer is bytes
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, bytes):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)
        else:
            # If it's a string, open as binary
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if isinstance(contents, str):  # Handle if content is a string
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents.encode(self._encoding))
        else:  # If content is already bytes, use as it is
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

By checking the type of `filepath_or_buffer` and the type of its content, and then handling the encoding appropriately, this should resolve the bug and allow the `XportReader` class to initialize correctly when passed a file object.
