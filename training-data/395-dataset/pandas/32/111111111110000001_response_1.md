The error occurs in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class. The error is due to the attempt to encode the `contents` variable, which is of type `bytes`. This is causing the `AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'`.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is of type `bytes` separately from the case where it is of type `str`. Instead of trying to encode `contents`, we can directly use it as it is because it is already in bytes format.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:  # Handle bytes directly
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)

    self._read_header()
```

This code checks if `filepath_or_buffer` is of type `bytes`, and if so, it directly uses `BytesIO` to handle the bytes input. This avoids the attempt to encode `contents` and resolves the `AttributeError`.
