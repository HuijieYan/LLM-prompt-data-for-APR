The error is likely occurring in the `__init__` method of the `sas_xport.py` file. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to encode a bytes object. This suggests that the variable `contents` is of type bytes, and the `encode` method is being called on it, which is not valid for bytes objects.

The bug is likely caused by the assumption that the input file is text, so the code tries to handle it as such. However, in this case, the input file is a binary file.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the input file differently based on its type. If the file is a string or bytes object, it should be opened in binary mode. If it is a file-like object, it should be processed differently to handle the binary data appropriately.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

In this corrected method, we first check if the `filepath_or_buffer` is a string or bytes object. If it is, we open it in binary mode. Otherwise, we assume it is a file-like object and read its contents into a `BytesIO` object. This should handle both text files and binary files correctly.
