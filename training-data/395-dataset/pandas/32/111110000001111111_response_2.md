The error occurs because the code is trying to encode the contents of the file using the _encoding attribute, but the content is already a bytes object. This results in the AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'.

To fix the bug, the code needs to check if the filepath_or_buffer is of type bytes before attempting to encode it with the _encoding attribute. If it's already a bytes object, it should not be encoded again.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class XportReader(abc.Iterator):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _read_header(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def read(self, nrows=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the buggy function corrected
    def __init__(
        self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
    ):
    
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize
    
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            if not isinstance(contents, bytes):  # check if contents is not a bytes object
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
    
        self._read_header()
```
