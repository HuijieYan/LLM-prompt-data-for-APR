The error occurs in the "__init__" function of the XportReader class. This function is responsible for reading the header of a SAS XPORT file, but it currently has some issues with handling the file object passed to it.

The bug is occurring because the function tries to encode the contents of the file using the specified encoding (self._encoding), which is causing an AttributeError when the input is a bytes object. This is due to improper handling of different types of input file objects.

To fix this bug, the function should handle different types of input file objects correctly, without attempting unnecessary encoding operations on bytes objects.

Here's the corrected code for the "__init__" function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if hasattr(filepath_or_buffer, "read"):
        # If the input has a read method, assume it's a file-like object
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
    else:
        # If it's a string, open it as a file
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input: filepath_or_buffer must be a file path or file-like object")

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the input "filepath_or_buffer" has a "read" method, which indicates that it is a file-like object. If so, we assign it directly to "self.filepath_or_buffer". If it does not have a "read" method, we check if it is a string or bytes object and then open it as a file. If it is neither, we raise a ValueError.

This approach ensures that the function can handle different types of file-like objects and string/bytes inputs correctly, without causing encoding errors.
