The issue arises from the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class in the `sas_xport.py` file. 

The problem occurs because the function assumes that the input `filepath_or_buffer` is always a string and attempts to encode the contents. However, in the provided code sample, `filepath_or_buffer` is passed as a file buffer (`<_io.BufferedReader>`), causing the AttributeError when attempting to encode the file buffer.

To fix the bug, the function should check the type of `filepath_or_buffer` and handle the file buffer case separately to avoid the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:  # Handle file buffer case
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

By checking the type of `filepath_or_buffer` and handling the file buffer case appropriately, the function should no longer raise an AttributeError when attempting to encode the contents.
