The potential error in the given code is in the initialization of the function. It looks like this code is meant to be part of a class, indicated by the use of `self` and the use of `__init__` as the function name. However, the `__init__` method is not properly formatted as a class method.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method is missing the `self` parameter as the first argument. This is causing the method to fail when trying to access any instance variables or methods using `self`.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should include the `self` parameter as the first argument. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        try:
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        except UnicodeEncodeError:
            pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, `self` is added as the first parameter of the `__init__` method, allowing it to access and modify instance variables.
