The error message indicates that the AttributeError is occurring at line 269 of the sas_xport.py file, specifically when trying to encode the contents of the file.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it is clear that the error is occurring because the function is trying to encode the contents of the file when it is already in binary format.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code so that it handles the binary file appropriately without attempting to encode it. We can use the 'rb' mode for opening the binary file and make necessary adjustments to handle binary data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from io import BytesIO

def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

With this correction, the function will be able to handle binary files appropriately without encountering the AttributeError.
