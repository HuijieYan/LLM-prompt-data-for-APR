The test case is attempting to read a SAS file using the `read_sas` method, passing a file object (`BufferedReader`) obtained from GCSFS. The error occurs when trying to encode the contents of the file, resulting in an AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'.

The potential error location is in the `__init__` method of the XportReader class, specifically in the code that tries to encode the contents of the file. The method is attempting to encode the contents even if it's already in bytes format (as in the case of the file object obtained from GCSFS).

The error occurs because the code attempts to encode the contents of the file unconditionally, without checking whether it's necessary.

To fix the bug, the method should first check if the contents are already in bytes format before attempting to encode them. If the contents are already in bytes format, there is no need to encode them again.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Check if the data is already in bytes format
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer.read(), bytes):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer  # If already in bytes, no need to encode
        else:
            # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            try:
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
    
    self._read_header()
```
This correction should prevent the AttributeError when attempting to read a file object from GCSFS and use it with the `read_sas` method.
