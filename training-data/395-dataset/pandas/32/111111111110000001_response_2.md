The error message indicates that the code is trying to call the `encode` method on a `bytes` object, which is not allowed. This occurs in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class, specifically in the following lines:

```python
contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
```

The `read` method returns a `bytes` object, and then the code tries to call `encode` on it, which is causing the error.

To fix this issue, we can simply remove the `encode` call and directly assign the `contents` to `self.filepath_or_buffer`. This will handle both the cases where `filepath_or_buffer` is a string/bytes or a file object.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
```

By making this change, the code no longer tries to call `encode` on the `contents` object and should resolve the error.
