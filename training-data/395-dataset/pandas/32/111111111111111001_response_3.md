The error occurred because the `contents` is already in bytes and an attempt is made to encode it again.

To fix the bug, modify the `__init__` function in the XportReader class as follows:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # No need to encode, it's already in bytes
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer.read())

    self._read_header()
```

By removing the attempt to encode `contents` and directly assigning it to `self.filepath_or_buffer`, the bug is fixed. The `contents` is already in bytes, so it does not need to be encoded again.
