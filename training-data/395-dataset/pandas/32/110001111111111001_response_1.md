The error occurs due to the `AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'` at line 269 in the file `pandas/io/sas/sas_xport.py`. This points to the problematic line in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class where the `contents` (which is a bytes object) is being attempted to encode using the `_encoding` attribute.

The reason behind the bug is that the `contents` variable, which is a bytes object, does not have an `encode` attribute. This suggests that the `encoding` is not being handled correctly for the `contents`.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to handle the encoding explicitly while reading the file or buffer, or use the `encoding` passed as an argument for reading the contents. This ensures that the encoding is applied to the text read from the file or buffer before working with it.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        with open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb") as file:
            contents = file.read().decode(encoding)
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents.encode(encoding))
    else:
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read().decode(encoding)
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents.encode(encoding))

    self._read_header()
```
