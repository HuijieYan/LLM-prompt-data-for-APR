The error occurs because the `read_sas` function is not correctly handling the different types of input that can be passed to `filepath_or_buffer`. It expects a file path or buffer, but when passed a buffer, it fails to encode the contents.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `filepath_or_buffer` is correctly handled when it can be a file path string, a file object, or a buffer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
    elif isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # filepath_or_buffer is a file-like object or buffer
        try:
            # Try to read the contents and encode if necessary
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            try:
                # Attempt to encode the contents
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            except AttributeError:
                # No need to encode
                pass
        except AttributeError:
            # File-like object doesn't have read method, copy it directly
            contents = filepath_or_buffer
        # Use BytesIO to create a file-like object
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

This corrected code handles the different input scenarios for `filepath_or_buffer` and ensures that the contents are correctly encoded when necessary.
