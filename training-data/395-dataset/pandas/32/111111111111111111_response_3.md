The error occurs in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class in the file `sas_xport.py`. The error is an AttributeError raised when trying to encode the contents of a file object. In this case, the `contents` variable is expected to be a bytes-like object, and attempting to encode a bytes object raises the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the `filepath_or_buffer` parameter correctly, ensuring that we handle both file paths and file objects properly.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    fp_or_buf_is_path = isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str)
    if fp_or_buf_is_path:
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if fp_or_buf_is_path or isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, bytes):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Ensure no encoding for file-like objects
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
```

In this corrected method, we check if the `filepath_or_buffer` parameter is a file path or a file-like object. If it's a file path, we open the file and set the `filepath_or_buffer` attribute. If it's a file-like object, we directly set the `filepath_or_buffer` attribute to that object.

This should fix the AttributeError related to encoding a bytes object and ensure that the file object is handled properly.
