The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when the code tries to encode the contents of a file that is passed as a bytes object. This suggests that the issue is likely with the encoding of the file contents.

The bug seems to be caused by passing a file in bytes mode to the read_sas function, which tries to encode the contents using a specified encoding. This causes an AttributeError because the contents are already in bytes mode and do not need to be encoded.

To fix the bug, the code needs to check whether the provided filepath_or_buffer is already a bytes object before attempting to encode it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class XportReader(abc.Iterator):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected version of the function
    def __init__(
        self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
    ):

        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize

        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
                (
                    filepath_or_buffer,
                    encoding,
                    compression,
                    should_close,
                ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

            if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, bytes):
                self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)

        else:
            # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

        self._read_header()
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the filepath_or_buffer is a string or bytes object. If it's a string, we process it as before. If it's a bytes object, we simply initialize the filepath_or_buffer as a BytesIO object using the given bytes without attempting to encode it.

This change should prevent the AttributeError that was previously occurring when a file object in bytes mode was passed to the function.
