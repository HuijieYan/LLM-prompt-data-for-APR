Potential error location: 
The code seems to be trying to handle both file paths and buffer inputs, but there are some issues when handling the file path. Additionally, there is a potential issue with the open mode "rb" which should be "r" instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The code is trying to handle both file paths and buffer inputs but does not handle these cases correctly.
2. The open mode "rb" may cause issues when reading the file.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the file path and buffer inputs separately to ensure the correct handling of each case.
2. Use the correct open mode for reading the file.

Corrected code:
```python
class XportReader(abc.Iterator):
    # ... omitted code ...


    def _read_header(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def read(self, nrows=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    def __init__(
        self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
    ):
    
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize
    
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            (
                filepath_or_buffer,
                encoding,
                compression,
                should_close,
            ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
    
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "r")
        else:
            # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            try:
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
                self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
    
        self._read_header()
