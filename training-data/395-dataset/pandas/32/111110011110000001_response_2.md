The error occurs in the "__init__" function of the XportReader class. Specifically, the error happens when the "encode" method is called on the "contents" variable, which is of type bytes. The AttributeError is raised because the "encode" method cannot be called on a bytes object.

To fix this bug, the program should check the type of "contents" before calling the "encode" method. If the type is bytes, then there is no need to encode it, so the "encode" method should be skipped.

Here's the corrected code for the "__init__" function:

```python
# this is the corrected __init__ function
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if isinstance(contents, str):
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the type of "contents" before attempting to encode it. If it's a string, then it will be encoded. Otherwise, if it's already bytes, the encoding step is skipped. This ensures that the AttributeError is avoided.
