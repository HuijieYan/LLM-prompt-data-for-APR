The error is occurring at the `extract_index` function which is called from `arrays_to_mgr`, which in turn is called from the `init_ndarray` function. The error message indicates that an index must be passed if using all scalar values.

The issue in the `init_ndarray` function is that it is not handling the case where only scalar values are being passed correctly. It should check for this case and raise a `ValueError` if no index is provided.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for scalar values and raise a `ValueError` if no index is is provided. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_categorical_dtype, is_object_dtype
from pandas.core.internals.construction import extract_index, arrays_to_mgr
from pandas.core.series import BaseSeries


def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    # input must be a ndarray, list, Series, index

    if isinstance(values, BaseSeries):
        if columns is None:
            if values.name is not None:
                columns = [values.name]
        if index is None:
            index = values.index
        else:
            values = values.reindex(index)

        # zero len case (GH #2234)
        if not len(values) and columns is not None and len(columns):
            values = np.empty((0, 1), dtype=object)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    if is_object_dtype(values):
        if not index:
            raise ValueError("If using all scalar values, you must pass an index")

    return create_block_manager_from_blocks(block_values, [columns, index])

```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for scalar values and raised a `ValueError` if no index is provided in that case. This should resolve the issue and the test case should pass without error.
