The error is likely occurring in the `_init_ndarray` function of the DataFrame constructor. This function seems to be receiving an array of datetimes and is failing to handle them correctly. The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where the input array values have a dtype of `datetime64[ns, UTC]`. The function assumes that the dtype is not understood and raises a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the values have a datetime dtype and convert them to the appropriate format before constructing the DataFrame. This involves properly handling the datetime dtype and initializing the dataframe accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    if dtype is not None and is_datetime_dtype(values):
        values = values.astype('datetime64[ns]')
        
    df = pd.DataFrame(data=values, index=index, columns=columns, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
    return df
```

This corrected function checks if the input array `values` has a datetime dtype and converts it to 'datetime64[ns]' before constructing the dataframe. This approach ensures that the datetime dtype is handled properly and the DataFrame is initialized correctly.
