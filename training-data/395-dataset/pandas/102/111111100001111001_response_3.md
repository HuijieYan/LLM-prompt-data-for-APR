The buggy function `init_ndarray` is designed to initialize a 2D array along with optional index and columns. It is intended to handle various data types such as ndarray, list, series, and index. The bug occurs when the function attempts to initialize the columns but uses a list format instead of a single value when the input is a 2D array. This results in an error when handling the columns due to the discrepancy in data types.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the case where the input is a 2D array correctly. In this scenario, the columns should be initialized as a single integer value (e.g., 0) instead of a list.

Here's the corrected code for the `init_ndarray` function:

```python
def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    if values.ndim == 2:  # Check if the input is a 2D array
        columns = [0]  # Initialize 'columns' as a single integer for 2D arrays
    else:
        if not isinstance(columns, list):  # Ensure 'columns' is a list for other data types
            columns = [columns]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return create_block_manager_from_blocks(block_values, [columns, index])
```
