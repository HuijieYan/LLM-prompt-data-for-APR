Looking at the test case `test_from_2d_ndarray_with_dtype`, it seems to be creating a DataFrame from a 2D ndarray `array_dim2` with a specified dtype of "datetime64[ns, UTC]". The error message indicates that the error occurs when trying to initialize the DataFrame using the `init_ndarray` function, specifically during the process of extracting the index.

The bug seems to occur in the `arrays_to_mgr` function, where the error is raised due to a missing index when using all scalar values.

The reason behind the bug is that the code does not handle the scenario of using all scalar values without passing an index. The logic for handling the range of input types is not complete, leading to this error.

One approach to fixing this bug would be to add a condition in the `init_ndarray` function to handle the scenario when using all scalar values without passing an index. This condition should check whether an index is provided and, if not, handle the case by creating an index based on the length of the values. Additionally, a check can be added to ensure that an index is always provided when using all scalar values.

Here's the corrected code for the `init_ndarray` function:

```python
def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    if isinstance(values, ABCSeries):
        # Handling for Series input
        if columns is None:
            if values.name is not None:
                columns = [values.name]
        if index is None:
            index = values.index
        else:
            values = values.reindex(index)

        # zero len case (GH #2234)
        if not len(values) and columns is not None and len(columns):
            values = np.empty((0, 1), dtype=object)

    if index is None and not isinstance(values, (list, np.ndarray)) and not isinstance(values, ABCSeries):
        # Handling case when all scalar values are passed without an index
        index = pd.RangeIndex(start=0, stop=len(values))

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original code...
    # ...
```

By adding this condition, the function should now handle the scenario when using all scalar values without passing an index, ensuring that the bug is fixed.
