The test case `test_from_2d_ndarray_with_dtype` is trying to create a DataFrame using the `pd.DataFrame` constructor with an input 2D ndarray `array_dim2` and a specified dtype of `datetime64[ns, UTC]`. The expected output is the DataFrame with the specified dtype. However, the test is failing with a `ValueError` stating "If using all scalar values, you must pass an index".

The bug is likely occurring in the `init_ndarray` function, specifically when it tries to extract the index from the input data. This is likely due to the absence of an index, which is essential for creating a DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the function is unable to extract an index when the input contains all scalar values. This is why it's raising a `ValueError` for this specific scenario.

To fix the bug, the `init_ndarray` function should handle the case when all scalar values are provided without an index. It should provide a default index or allow the user to explicitly pass an index in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `init_ndarray` function:

```python
def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    if index is None:
        # Define a default index when it's not provided
        index = pd.RangeIndex(start=0, stop=len(values))
        
    return pd.DataFrame(values, index=index, columns=columns, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
```

In this corrected code, if the index is not provided, a default index is created using `pd.RangeIndex` starting from 0 and ending at the length of the input values. This will handle the scenario where all scalar values are used without explicitly passing an index.
