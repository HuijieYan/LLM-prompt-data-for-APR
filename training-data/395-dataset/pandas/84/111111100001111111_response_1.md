The error is occurring because the `_get_level_number` method is unable to handle tuple inputs for multi-level index names.

The bug is located in the `_unstack_multiple` function on line 317, where it attempts to get the level number for each element in the `clocs` list using the `_get_level_number` method.

The bug occurs because the `_get_level_number` method uses a different approach when dealing with single-level names and multi-level names. When a tuple is passed as the level name, it should be treated as a multi-level name, but the current implementation does not handle it correctly.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle tuple inputs as multi-level names correctly. This can be done by checking the type of the input and handling single-level names and multi-level names separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    cloc_levels = [cloc if isinstance(cloc, tuple) else (cloc,) for cloc in clocs]

    cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(cloc) for cloc in cloc_levels]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged...
```

This modification will allow the function to handle both single-level names and multi-level names correctly, fixing the Key Error related to tuple inputs for multi-level index names.
