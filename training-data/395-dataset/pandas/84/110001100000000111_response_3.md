The error occurs when trying to unstack a Series with a MultiIndex using the "unstack" method. The error message indicates that the "A" level is not found, which prevents the unstacking operation from being completed successfully.

Upon inspecting the code, it appears that the issue lies in the "_unstack_multiple" function. The function is designed to handle the unstacking operation for multi-level indices, but it has a bug that causes the "Level A not found" error.

The reason for this bug is that the function doesn't properly handle the hierarchical columns, which leads to the incorrect identification of the levels for unstacking.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle hierarchical columns and level names. This can be achieved by revising the logic for identifying the levels, codes, and names during the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected code for the "_unstack_multiple" function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    index = data.index

    levels = list(index.levels)
    codes = list(index.codes)

    new_levels = []
    new_codes = []
    new_names = []

    for i in range(len(clocs)):
        if index.names[i] in clocs:
            cloc = clocs.index(index.names[i])
            new_levels.append(levels[i])
            new_codes.append(codes[i])
            new_names.append(index.names[i])
            levels[i] = None  # Set the level to None for unstacking
        else:
            new_levels.append([None for _ in range(len(levels[i]))])

    unstacked = data.unstack(level=new_names[0], fill_value=fill_value)

    reshaped_levels = list(unstacked.columns if isinstance(unstacked, pd.DataFrame) else unstacked.index)

    for i in range(len(new_names)):
        new_levels[i] = reshaped_levels

    new_index = pd.MultiIndex(levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names)

    if isinstance(unstacked, pd.Series):
        unstacked.index = new_index
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_index

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code revises the logic for unstacking multiple levels of a hierarchical column index. It correctly identifies the levels, codes, and names for unstacking, leading to the successful transformation of the data to the desired shape.
