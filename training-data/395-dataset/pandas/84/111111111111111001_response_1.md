The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class when the level passed to it is a tuple. Since the level is a tuple, it doesn't exist as a single level in the MultiIndex.

The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is that it tries to resolve clocs by calling `_get_level_number` on the index for each element in clocs. However, clocs should not be a tuple. The original code assumes the level should be a single value, not a tuple of values.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should handle the case where clocs is a tuple. If clocs is a tuple, it should be unpacked, then each element should be processed individually.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple
        clocs = list(clocs)  # Convert clocs tuple to a list

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # ... Rest of the function remains the same ...
```

With this correction, the function will be able to handle both single-level and multi-level input for clocs. This change ensures that the function can process both tuples and single values as the level to be unstacked.
