The error occurred in the `_unstack_multiple` function, specifically in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The error message indicates that the method `_get_level_number` in the `MultiIndex` class is unable to find the level named 'A', hence raising a KeyError.

The reason behind this bug is that the method `_get_level_number` expects the input to be an integer representing the level number, not the level name. This discrepancy results in the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `clocs` list should contain the level numbers instead of the level names. We need to update the code to get the level numbers from the names before using them to unstack the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we check if the element in `clocs` is a tuple (indicating the level name) and if so, we use `index._get_level_number` to get the level number. If the element is already a level number, it is used as is.

This change allows the `_unstack_multiple` function to correctly handle the input and avoid the KeyError.
