The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function due to the `clocs` list containing labels for levels in a MultiIndex. The error is raised because the `index._get_level_number` method is unable to handle tuple names in the MultiIndex. This is causing a KeyError to be raised.

To fix this bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to handle tuple names in the MultiIndex when calling the `index._get_level_number` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            loc = index._get_loc(cloc)
            cloc_numbers.append(loc)
        else:
            cloc_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the for loop iterates through each item in `clocs`. If the item is a tuple, it uses the `index._get_loc` method to get the location of the tuple in the MultiIndex. Otherwise, it uses the `index._get_level_number` method as before.

With these changes, the function should now be able to handle tuple names in the MultiIndex and unstack the data correctly in the test cases provided.
