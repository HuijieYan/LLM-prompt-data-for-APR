The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`, and it is related to the handling of MultiIndex with tuple names.

The issue stems from the `_get_level_number()` function, which attempts to find the level number by name. However, in the case of a MultiIndex with tuple names, the 'level' is actually a tuple, not a single label, hence resulting in the error.

To fix this issue, the code should be updated to handle the tuple names when finding the level number. Additionally, the access to the `names` and `index` attributes within `_get_level_number()` needs to be modified to support the MultiIndex tuple naming.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    for cloc in clocs:
        for label in cloc:
            for idx, name in enumerate(index.names):
                if name == label:
                    cloc_numbers.append(idx)

    # ... (omitted code) ...
```
In this corrected code, the `clocs` are iterated over, and for each label in the tuple, the index number in the `index.names` list is found and added to the `cloc_numbers` list for further processing.

This approach correctly handles MultiIndex with tuple names when finding the level number, addressing the root cause of the bug.
