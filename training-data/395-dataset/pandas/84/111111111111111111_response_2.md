The issue is occurring due to the `clocs` variable containing the tuple `(A, a)`, which is not being handled properly in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

The error is likely happening because the function expects the `level` variable to be an integer representing the level number, but it is receiving a tuple instead.

To fix this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to handle the case when `clocs` contains a tuple instead of an integer level number.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rename clocs to level numbers if clocs contains tuples
    if isinstance(clocs[0], tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
    # (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    return unstacked
```

By adding a conditional check to handle the case when `clocs` contains tuples, the function can dynamically handle both tuple names and level numbers, resolving the KeyError.

This change will allow the function to process the unstacking correctly, respecting the expected level names or level numbers. After these changes, the function should work properly for both single level numbers and tuples in MultiIndex objects.
