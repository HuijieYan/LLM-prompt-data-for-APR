The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is occurring due to the use of a tuple as the level parameter for unstacking. When the function tries to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`, it encounters a ValueError because it is unable to find the level name 'A' in the list of level names.

The error occurs because the code expects the level to be an integer representing the position of the level in the MultiIndex, but instead, it receives a tuple.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case where the level is specified as a tuple of names. Instead of directly using `index._get_level_number(i)` which expects an integer level number, the code should first check if the input `i` is a tuple or an integer. If it's a tuple, it should handle the input accordingly by using the names in the tuple to identify the level. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    new_clocs = []
    for i in clocs:
        if isinstance(i, tuple):  # Handle tuple input
            level_number = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in i]
            new_clocs.append(level_number)
        else:  # Handle integer input
            new_clocs.append(i)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

This correction will handle both single integer levels and tuples of level names as input for unstacking the MultiIndex. It addresses the bug by properly handling the different types of input for specifying the level to unstack.
