The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. This line is trying to get the level numbers for the specified level names, but it's currently failing because the `index._get_level_number` method expects a level name as a string, and it's being passed a tuple of names instead.

The bug occurs because the input parameter `clocs` is being passed as a tuple of names `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, but the function is expecting a single level name or a list of level names.

To fix this bug, we should modify the input parameter `clocs` to match the expected format. The input parameter should be either a single level name as a string, or a list of level names.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if not isinstance(clocs, (list, tuple)):
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With this modification, the function will handle both single level names and a list of level names correctly. The bug should be fixed, and the function should work as expected.
