The error is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class. The error message "ValueError: 'A' is not in list" suggests that the level 'A' is not found within the list of names. This is likely causing the subsequent KeyError.

The root cause of the bug is that the `clocs` variable which contains the level names is not being processed correctly. It seems that the provided function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to extract level numbers from level names using `index._get_level_number(i)`, but due to the presence of tuples in the MultiIndex names, it is encountering issues.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to process the level names correctly and convert them into level numbers before using them to unstack the DataFrame.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert level names to level numbers
    clocs_list = [index._get_level_number(name) for name in clocs]
    
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs_list, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs_list, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected function, we directly convert the level names to level numbers before using them to unstack the DataFrame. This should resolve the previous error by ensuring that the level names are correctly processed.
