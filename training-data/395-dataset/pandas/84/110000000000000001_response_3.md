Potential error location: The function is trying to unstack the data using some complex logic and conditions, which could be leading to the bug.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The code is complex and difficult to follow, making it hard to identify the exact cause of the bug.
2. The function is not handling hierarchical columns properly, leading to potential issues with unstacking.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the logic for unstacking the data.
2. Ensure proper handling of hierarchical columns.
3. Use more descriptive variable names for easier understanding.

Corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```
