The error message indicates that the `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` occurs when the `df.unstack(("A", "a"))` method is called in the test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex`. The error seems to be related to finding the level number for a specified level in the MultiIndex.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_level_number` function, particularly when it tries to find the index of the specified level. It seems that the approach used to find the level number for a specified level in the MultiIndex is causing the error.

The bug occurs because the given method for obtaining the level number for a specified level in the MultiIndex is incorrect and does not handle the multi-level index properly.

To fix this bug, a correct method for obtaining the level number is necessary. This method should properly handle multi-level indices and return the level number for the specified level.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
        return unstacked
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

        # Reconstruct the columns and the index
        new_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(
            [(lvl, lbl) for lbl in unstacked.columns for lvl in data.index.levels[rlocs]],
            names=[data.index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
        )
        unstacked.columns = new_columns
        return unstacked
```

This corrected code uses the `unstack` method to perform the unstacking and then reconstructs the columns and index as necessary, taking into account the multi-level nature of the index.
