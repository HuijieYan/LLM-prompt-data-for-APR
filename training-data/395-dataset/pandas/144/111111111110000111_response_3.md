The test case `test_xtick_barPlot` is trying to verify if the xticks are being properly set on the bar plot generated by `pd.Series.plot.bar` method. The error message indicates that the expected xticks array has a different shape than the one obtained from `ax.get_xticks()`.

The potential error location is in the `_decorate_ticks` method of the `BarPlot` class, inside the file `core.py`. The issue may arise from how the xticks are being set and decorated within this method, which is causing the discrepancy in the shape of the expected and actual xticks arrays.

The bug occurs because the `_decorate_ticks` method does not properly handle the input xticks and may not be setting the tick positions correctly. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual xticks obtained in the test case.

To fix this bug, the `_decorate_ticks` method should be modified to properly handle the xticks input and set the tick positions accordingly. Additionally, it should ensure that the shape of the xticks array matches the shape of the expected xticks array.

Here's the corrected version of the `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(xticks)  # Use the provided xticks
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By adding the `xticks` parameter to the method and using it to set the xticks in the plot, we ensure that the provided xticks are used and the shape mismatch issue is resolved.
