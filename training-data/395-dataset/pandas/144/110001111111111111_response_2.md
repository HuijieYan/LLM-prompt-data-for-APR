The bug is likely in the _decorate_ticks function provided, where the ax.set_xticks() method is not being called properly. This seems to be causing the issue where the xticks argument has no effect in the plot.bar() function.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly set the xticks on the plot using the provided tick_pos attribute.

To fix the bug, the ax.set_xticks() method should be called with self.tick_pos as the argument to set the xticks on the plot.

Here's the corrected code for the _decorate_ticks function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(list(self.tick_pos))  # Fix: Convert range to list for proper setting of xticks
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By converting the range self.tick_pos to a list when setting the xticks, the bug should be fixed and the xticks argument should have the expected effect in the plot.bar() function.
