The error message indicates that the xticks are not being set correctly within the `plot.bar()` function. This is likely due to the `_decorate_ticks` method not setting the xticks properly.

The bug is occurring in the `_decorate_ticks` method, where the xticks are being set using `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`. However, it seems that `self.tick_pos` is not being properly defined or passed into the method, leading to the xticks not being set as expected.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_decorate_ticks` method to accept the xticks as an argument and set them accordingly.

Here's the corrected `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks=None):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By adding the `xticks` argument to the method and checking if it's provided, we can now properly set the xticks within the `plot.bar()` function.

This should resolve the issue of not being able to set xticks within the `bar()` plotting function.
