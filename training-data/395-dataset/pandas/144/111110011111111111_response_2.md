The error message indicates that the xticks argument has no effect on the bar plot. This is unexpected behavior, as the xticks should be set to the specified range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_decorate_ticks` method. It appears that the method is not correctly setting the xticks on the bar plot.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling or setting of xticks within the `_decorate_ticks` method. It is not correctly applying the specified xticks to the bar plot.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the specified xticks are correctly applied to the bar plot. This can be done by modifying the `_decorate_ticks` method to properly set the xticks using the specified range.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))  # set the xticks using the length of ticklabels
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
