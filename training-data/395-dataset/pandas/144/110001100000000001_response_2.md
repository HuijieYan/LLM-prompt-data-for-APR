Potential error location: The line "ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)" seems to be causing the bug, as "self.tick_pos" is not defined within the function.

Reason for the bug: The variable "self.tick_pos" is not defined within the function, causing it to raise an error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Pass "self.tick_pos" as a parameter to the function, or define "self.tick_pos" within the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, tick_pos, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
