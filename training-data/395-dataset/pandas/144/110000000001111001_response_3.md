Potential error location: The `self.tick_pos` variable is not defined within the `_decorate_ticks` method. It should be accessed using `self` since it's an attribute of the class.

Reason for the bug: The variable `self.tick_pos` is being accessed directly in the `_decorate_ticks` method, which suggests that `self.tick_pos` should be an instance variable of the class. However, it seems to be accessed without being defined in the provided code.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `_decorate_ticks` method to access `self.tick_pos` using the `self` reference, assuming that `self.tick_pos` is an instance variable of the class.

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By using `self.tick_pos` instead of just `tick_pos`, we ensure that the `tick_pos` variable is accessed as an instance variable of the class. This would fix the bug and enable the function to work as intended.
