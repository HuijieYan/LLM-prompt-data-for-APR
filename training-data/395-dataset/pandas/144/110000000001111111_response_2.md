Potential error location: The problematic function is failing to set the xticks using the `self.tick_pos` attribute.

Reason behind the bug: The bug seems to be occurring because the `self.tick_pos` attribute is not being used to set the xticks on the plot.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Update the `_decorate_ticks` function to use the `self.tick_pos` attribute to set the xticks on the plot.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
