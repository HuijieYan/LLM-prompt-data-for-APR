The bug is occurring in the `_decorate_ticks` function. The issue seems to be with setting the xticks in the plot. The `xticks` should be set using the `self.tick_pos` and `ticklabels` variables, according to the input runtime value and type provided. 

The buggy function is not using the correct variables to set the xticks, which is causing the xticks argument to have no effect. 

To fix the bug, we need to use the `self.tick_pos` and `ticklabels` variables to set the xticks in the plot.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
