# Buggy function source code
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
unable to set xticks within bar() plotting function
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
In the code below:

pd.Series(range(10), index=range(10)).plot.bar(xticks=range(0, 11, 2))
xticks argument has no effect. However, there's no such problem in line() plot.

Expected Output
Output plot is expected to have xticks defined by xticks argument, e.g. in the example above it should be set to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10].
```
