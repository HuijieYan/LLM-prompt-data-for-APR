The issue with the `_decorate_ticks` function is that it is not using the `self.tick_pos` attribute to set the xticks on the plot. Instead, it is using `self.tick_pos` to set the xlim of the plot. Additionally, the function is not using the `start_edge` and `end_edge` parameters.

To fix this issue, we need to update the function so that it uses the `self.tick_pos` attribute to set the xticks on the plot and uses the `start_edge` and `end_edge` parameters to set the xlim of the plot.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

With this correction, the function will now use the `self.tick_pos` attribute to set the xticks on the plot and will use the `start_edge` and `end_edge` parameters to set the xlim of the plot. This should resolve the issue of not being able to set xticks within the `bar()` plotting function.
