The issue here is that the xticks are not being set in the bar plot function as expected. The xticks argument should be used to set the position of the x-axis ticks, but it is not having any effect. 

The potential error location is within the _decorate_ticks() function, specifically in the line ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos). It seems that self.tick_pos is being used to set the xticks, but it's not being properly initialized or used for this purpose.

The bug occurs because the xticks are not being set correctly within the bar plot function, which results in the xticks argument having no effect. This is likely due to a problem with how self.tick_pos is being used to set the xticks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the xticks are properly set using the self.tick_pos array. This can be done by directly setting the xticks to the range of the data points in the bar plot, using self.tick_pos.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(range(len(self.tick_pos)))
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
