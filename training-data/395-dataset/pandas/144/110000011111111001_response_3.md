The error message is showing that there is a mismatch in the shapes of the expected and actual arrays for the xticks. This indicates that the buggy function `_decorate_ticks` is not setting the xticks correctly on the plot.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue might be with setting the xticks using `self.tick_pos` instead of `self.xticks`. Also, it's not clear from the code provided where `name` is coming from. It seems `name` should be obtained from the `self` object.

To fix the bug:
1. Replace `self.tick_pos` with `self.xticks` for setting xticks in the function `_decorate_ticks`.
2. Obtain the value for `name` from the `self` object to set the x-label if it's not None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By making these changes, the function should properly set the xticks and x-labels on the plot, fixing the bug identified in the provided test case.
