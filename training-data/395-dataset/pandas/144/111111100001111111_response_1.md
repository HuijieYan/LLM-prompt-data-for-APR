The issue seems to be with the `_decorate_ticks` method within the `BarPlot` class. The method is expected to set the xticks for the bar plot, but the provided inputs do not seem to be reflected in the expected output.

The potential error location is where the xticks are being set using `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`. It seems that the `self.tick_pos` is not being used properly to set the xticks.

The bug occurs because the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line is not using the correct xticks to set on the plot. Instead of `self.tick_pos`, it should use the `tick_pos` parameter directly.

To fix the bug, the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line should be replaced with `ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
