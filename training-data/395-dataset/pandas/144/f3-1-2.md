The issue description is:

```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
In the code below:

pd.Series(range(10), index=range(10)).plot.bar(xticks=range(0, 11, 2))
xticks argument has no effect. However, there's no such problem in line() plot.

Expected Output
Output plot is expected to have xticks defined by xticks argument, e.g. in the example above it should be set to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10].
```
