Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the `_decorate_ticks` function of the `BarPlot` class. The `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line is not setting the xticks as expected based on the test function.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `self.tick_pos` variable might not be properly initialized or updated with the xticks provided in the `s.plot.bar(xticks=range(0, 11, 2))` call. This leads to the xticks not being set correctly on the plot.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update or initialize the `self.tick_pos` variable with the xticks provided in the `s.plot.bar(xticks=range(0, 11, 2))` call.
2. Override the `_decorate_ticks` function to directly use the xticks provided in the `s.plot.bar(xticks=range(0, 11, 2))` call instead of using `self.tick_pos`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(range(0, len(ticklabels)))
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
