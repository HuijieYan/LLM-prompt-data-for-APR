The potential error location within the `_decorate_ticks` function is the setting of xticks using `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`. The bug seems to be with setting custom xticks within the bar() plotting function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The bug is likely occurring because the function is not using the specified xticks when plotting the bar chart.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use the specified xticks provided in the `xticks` argument when plotting the bar chart.
- Modify the function to handle the custom xticks properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

This corrected method includes an additional parameter `xticks` to accept the custom xticks and sets the xticks using `ax.set_xticks(xticks)` which will utilize the specified xticks when plotting the bar chart.
