The bug in the function `_decorate_ticks` is related to the usage of `self.tick_pos` to set the xticks on the plot. The variable `self.tick_pos` is not defined in the given code and this is the reason behind the occurrence of the bug. 

To fix the bug, we can replace `self.tick_pos` with `np.arange(len(ticklabels))` which creates an array of ticks based on the number of tick labels. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
# corrected function
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(np.arange(len(ticklabels)))
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
