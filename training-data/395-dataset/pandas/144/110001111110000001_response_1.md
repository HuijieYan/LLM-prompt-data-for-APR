The error message indicates that there's a shape mismatch between the expected xticks array and the actual xticks array obtained from the plot. This suggests that the `_decorate_ticks` function, which is responsible for setting the xticks for the plot, is not working correctly.

Looking at the `_decorate_ticks` function, the issue appears to be with the line `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`. The `self.tick_pos` variable is not defined within the function, which could be causing the xticks to be set incorrectly.

One approach to fixing this bug would be to pass the `xticks` parameter directly to the `_decorate_ticks` function and use it to set the xticks for the plot. This would ensure that the correct xticks are being used based on the provided parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By adding the `xticks` parameter to the function and using it to set the xticks for the plot, we can ensure that the correct xticks are used based on the provided parameter.
