Potential error location: 
The variable `self.use_index` is used to conditionally set the x-axis label in the `ax` object. However, the conditional check for `name is not None` is missing, and this indirectly connects to the `self.use_index` attribute as well.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to set the x-axis label is based only on the `self.use_index` attribute, without considering whether the `name` attribute is not None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Add a conditional check for `name is not None` before setting the x-axis label based on the `self.use_index` attribute.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:  # Added a conditional check for name is not None
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
