The potential error location within the _decorate_ticks method is the ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos) line, because it seems like the tick_pos is not being passed correctly. This could be the reason why the xticks argument has no effect when using the bar() plotting function.

The bug occurs because the tick position values are not being passed correctly to the set_xticks method. This prevents the xticks argument from having any effect, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The tick_pos attribute should be used to set the xticks, but it seems to be incorrectly used in the original code.

To fix the bug, we should replace ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos) with ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels))) in the _decorate_ticks method. This will ensure that the xticks are correctly set based on the tick labels provided.

Here's the corrected code for the _decorate_ticks method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
