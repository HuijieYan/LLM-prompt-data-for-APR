Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `_decorate_ticks` function not correctly setting the xticks for bar plots when using the `plot.bar` method.

Reasons behind the bug:
- The `plot.bar` method should pass the xticks argument to the `_decorate_ticks` function, but it seems that the function is not correctly handling this argument for bar plots.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Modify the `_decorate_ticks` function to properly handle the xticks argument for bar plots.
- Check if the xticks argument is being correctly passed from the `plot.bar` method to the `_decorate_ticks` function.
- Ensure that the tick positions and labels are being correctly set based on the xticks argument provided.

Corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks=None):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    else:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
