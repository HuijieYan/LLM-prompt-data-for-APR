The buggy function `_decorate_ticks` is responsible for setting the x-axis limits, ticks, and tick labels for a bar plot. The error message in the test function indicates that the expected x-tick positions do not match the actual x-tick positions retrieved using `ax.get_xticks()`.

Based on the error message, the discrepancy arises in the number of ticks between the expected and actual values. The discrepancy is likely due to the incorrect setting of x-ticks within the `_decorate_ticks` function.

To fix this issue, the `_decorate_ticks` function should use the `self.tick_pos` attribute to set the x-tick positions instead of relying on the external `xticks` parameter. Additionally, the existing code has hard-coded the x-axis limits, which might not be appropriate for all datasets.

To address these issues and improve the reliability and flexibility of the `_decorate_ticks` function, the `ax.set_xlim` and `ax.set_xticks` should be set using `start_edge`, `end_edge`, and `self.tick_pos`. The tick labels and the optional x-axis label should remain unchanged.

The corrected `_decorate_ticks` function is provided below:

```python
# Corrected function
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
