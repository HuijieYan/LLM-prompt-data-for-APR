The issue here seems to be with the `_decorate_ticks` function not setting the xticks properly when using the `plot.bar` method.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `ax.set_xticks()` function is being called with the correct tick positions from `self.tick_pos`. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `ax.set_xlim()` function is also called with the correct `start_edge` and `end_edge` values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(np.arange(len(ticklabels)))  # Set xticks based on the length of ticklabels
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In the corrected function, we are using `np.arange(len(ticklabels))` to set the xticks based on the length of the ticklabels array. This ensures that the xticks are set properly for the bar plot. We are also using the correct `start_edge` and `end_edge` values to set the x-axis limits.
