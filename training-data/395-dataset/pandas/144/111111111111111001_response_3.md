The bug is likely in the `_decorate_ticks` method of the `BarPlot` class. The error message indicates that the shapes of the left and right arrays are different. This suggests that there is a discrepancy in the number of elements or values in the arrays.

Looking at the `_decorate_ticks` method and the input parameters provided, it seems that the issue may be with setting the xticks. The `self.tick_pos` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 9, but the xticks are set using `range(0, 11, 2)`. This would result in different shapes or lengths for the tick positions and the tick labels.

To fix this issue, the xticks should be set to `self.tick_pos` which contains the correct positions for the ticks. Additionally, the start and end edges also look correct, so there is no need to change those parameters.

The corrected `_decorate_ticks` function should look like this:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By making these changes, the bug related to the discrepancy in array shapes should be fixed. This will ensure that the tick positions and labels align correctly.
