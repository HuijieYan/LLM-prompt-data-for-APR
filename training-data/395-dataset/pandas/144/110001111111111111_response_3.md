The error seems to be related to the `ax.get_xticks()` method returning a different array shape than expected. This suggests that the `_decorate_ticks` function is not setting the xticks properly, resulting in unexpected behavior in the test case.

The potential error location in the `_decorate_ticks` function could be in the line `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`. It seems that the `self.tick_pos` may not be correctly assigned or calculated when setting the xticks.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly set the xticks based on the input `xticks` parameter when using the `plot.bar` method.

To fix the bug, the `self.tick_pos` should be set based on the input `xticks` parameter. This can be achieved by modifying the `_decorate_ticks` function to explicitly use the `xticks` parameter passed to the `plot.bar` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    # Use the xticks parameter passed to the plot.bar method
    ax.set_xticks(self.xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

With this correction, the `self.tick_pos` is replaced with `self.xticks` to correctly set the xticks based on the input parameter.

This fix should ensure that the xticks are correctly set when using the `plot.bar` method, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
