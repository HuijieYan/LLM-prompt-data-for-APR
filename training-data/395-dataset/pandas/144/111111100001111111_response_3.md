The issue seems to be with the `_decorate_ticks` method of the `BarPlot` class. The method is supposed to set the x-axis ticks for the bar plot, but in the buggy implementation, it's not taking into account the `xticks` parameter passed to the `bar` method.

The issue occurs because the method is always setting the x-ticks based on `self.tick_pos`, regardless of whether `xticks` parameter is provided or not. This leads to the `xticks` parameter having no effect on the plot.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_decorate_ticks` method to use the `xticks` parameter if it is provided, otherwise fall back to the default `self.tick_pos`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks=None):
    if xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    else:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In this corrected code, we have added a new parameter `xticks` to the method. If `xticks` is provided, it will be used to set the x-ticks for the bar plot. Otherwise, it will fallback to using the default `self.tick_pos`. This change ensures that the `xticks` parameter passed to the `bar` method will have the intended effect on the plot.
