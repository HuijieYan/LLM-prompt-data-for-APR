The test case `test_xtick_barPlot` creates a pandas Series with a specified index and then calls the `plot.bar` method with custom xticks. It then compares the expected xticks with the actual xticks obtained from the plot using the `assert_numpy_array_equal` function.

The error message indicates that the shapes of the expected and actual xticks arrays are different. This suggests that there is a problem with setting the xticks in the `BarPlot` class.

Upon analyzing the `BarPlot` class and the `_decorate_ticks` method, it seems that the issue might be with the `self.tick_pos` attribute. It appears that `self.tick_pos` is not defined or initialized within the `_decorate_ticks` method.

To fix this issue, we can make sure that `self.tick_pos` is properly defined before calling the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    
    if hasattr(self, 'tick_pos') and self.tick_pos is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In this corrected version, we check if `self.tick_pos` exists and is not None before attempting to set the xticks on the plot. This prevents the error that was occurring due to the absence of `self.tick_pos`.
