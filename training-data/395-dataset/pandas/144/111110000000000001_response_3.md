Potential Error Location: The potential error lies in the usage of the variable self.tick_pos without it being defined within the _decorate_ticks function.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The variable self.tick_pos is being used within the _decorate_ticks function, but it is not being passed as an argument or defined within the function itself. This can lead to a NameError when the function is called.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: One approach to fixing this bug is to either pass self.tick_pos as an argument to the _decorate_ticks function, or define it within the function itself if it is a class attribute.

Corrected Code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # this is the corrected function
    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, tick_pos):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(tick_pos)
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
            
```
