Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be related to the `_decorate_ticks` method in the `BarPlot` class. The method is responsible for setting xticks for the bar plot, but there is an issue where the `xticks` argument specified in the `plot.bar()` function does not have any effect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_decorate_ticks` method is not correctly handling the `xticks` argument specified in the `plot.bar()` function. As a result, the xticks for the bar plot are not being set as expected.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The `_decorate_ticks` method should be modified to correctly handle the `xticks` argument and set the xticks for the bar plot accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if self.tick_pos is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    else:
        tick_pos = range(len(ticklabels))
        ax.set_xticks(tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
