The error message indicates that there is an issue with the data type of the "z" column when comparing the result and the expected DataFrames. The data type for the "z" column in the result is reported as 'object', whereas it should be 'datetime64[ns]' to match the expected DataFrame.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic that determines the data type and N/A values during concatenation of specified units.

The bug occurs because the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` isn't correctly handling the datetime data type when determining the upcasted data type and N/A value. The function is not returning the correct data type for the "z" column and is instead falling back to 'object' type.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the datetime data type needs to be updated to ensure that the correct data type ('datetime64[ns]') is returned for the "z" column.

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    # existing code

    if "datetime" in upcast_classes:
        # Return datetime data type and NaT for datetime columns
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
        return dtype, np.datetime64('NaT')

    # existing code
```

By updating the logic for handling the datetime data type in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function, we ensure that the correct data type ('datetime64[ns]') is returned for the "z" column when concatenating the specified units. This should fix the bug and ensure that the test case `test_merge_datetime_upcast_dtype` passes without errors.
