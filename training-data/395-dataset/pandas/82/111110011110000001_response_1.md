The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual data types of the "z" column after performing the merge operation. The expected data type is 'datetime64[ns]', while the actual data type is 'object'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the upcasting of datetime types. Specifically, the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` is responsible for determining the appropriate dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units, including datetime types.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the upcasting of datetime types correctly. This causes the merged DataFrame to have a different dtype for the "z" column than expected.

To fix the bug, the upcasting logic for datetime types should be reviewed and corrected. This involves identifying the correct upcast class for datetime types and ensuring that the dtype returned aligns with the expected dtype after the merge operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        # FIXME: integrate property
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    # Rest of the original logic for upcasting classes goes here...

    # Handle datetime upcasting
    if "datetime" in upcast_classes:
        dtype = np.dtype("M8[ns]")
        return dtype, pd.NaT

    msg = "invalid dtype determination in get_concat_dtype"
    raise AssertionError(msg)
```

By correcting the datetime upcasting logic and ensuring that the correct dtype and N/A value are returned, the bug should be fixed, and the test case should pass without any assertions.
