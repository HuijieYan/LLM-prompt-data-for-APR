The bug occurs in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function. This function is meant to determine the dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units. However, the way it handles the dtype determination and casting of N/A values seems to be causing the issue.

The problem is caused by the handling of N/A values and dtype determination in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function. It inconsistently handles the dtype casting and the N/A values, causing the assertion error from the test case. The dtype of the result dataframe is incorrectly converted to object if any rows from the left dataframe don't have a match on the right dataframe.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the dtype and N/A values. It should apply consistent casting rules for the N/A values and dtype determination to ensure that the result dataframe maintains the correct dtype, especially in scenarios where there are unmatched values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    dtypes = [None] * len(join_units)
    for i, unit in enumerate(join_units):
        if unit.block is not None:
            dtypes[i] = unit.block.dtype

    if any(dtype is None for dtype in dtypes):
        na = np.nan
    else:
        na = None

    # Generate the result dtype using the highest precision available
    empty_dtype = max(dtypes, key=lambda dtype: dtype.itemsize) if dtypes else np.float64

    return empty_dtype, na
```

In this corrected code, the function now iterates through all the join units to determine the dtypes of their blocks. If any dtype is missing (i.e., there is an unmatched value), it sets the N/A value to `np.nan`, otherwise, it sets it to `None`. Then, it calculates the result dtype using the highest precision available from the dtypes or falling back to `np.float64` if no dtypes are available. This should ensure that the result maintains the correct dtype, even in cases where there are unmatched values.
