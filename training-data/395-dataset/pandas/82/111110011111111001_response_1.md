The error message is indicating that there is a mismatch in the data type of the 'z' column between the `result` and the `expected` DataFrames. The 'z' column in the `result` DataFrame has the data type 'object' while in the `expected` DataFrame it has the data type 'datetime64[ns]'. This indicates that there is a problem with data type handling, likely within the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function.

After reviewing the code provided and understanding the variables and their values, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the datetime data type. The function should detect the data type correctly and return the appropriate upcasted data type and N/A value.

One potential reason for the bug could be that the function is not correctly identifying the datetime data type and handling the upcasting of the data type.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly identify the datetime data type and return the appropriate upcasted data type and N/A value for datetime data.

The corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    dtypes = [unit.dtype for unit in join_units if unit.block is not None]
    if len(dtypes) == 0:
        return np.float64, np.nan

    if any(is_datetime64_dtype(dtype) for dtype in dtypes):
        return np.dtype("M8[ns]"), np.datetime64('NaT')
    else:
        return np.dtype('O'), np.nan
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the join_units to collect the non-null dtypes. If there are datetime64 dtypes present, we return the upcasted datetime64 data type and NaT value. Otherwise, we return the object data type and NaN value. This corrected approach aims to properly handle the datetime data type and return the appropriate upcasted data type and N/A value.
