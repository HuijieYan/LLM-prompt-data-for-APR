The test case `test_merge_datetime_upcast_dtype` is failing because the dtype of the "z" column in the `expected` DataFrame is `datetime64[ns]`, but in the `result` DataFrame, it is inferred as `object`. This mismatch in dtype is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function is during the dtype determination and upcasting process when handling datetime types. The function should return the correct dtype and NA value for datetime types, but it is not doing so in the current implementation.

The issue occurs because the function may not be correctly identifying the datetime dtype and returning it with the appropriate upcasted NA value.

To fix the bug, revisions should be made to ensure that the function correctly identifies the datetime dtype and returns it with the appropriate upcasted NA value.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        # FIXME: integrate property
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    # ... (other parts of the code remain unchanged)

    # create the result with appropriate dtype and NA value for datetime
    # types
    if "datetimetz" in upcast_classes:
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")  # this is the correction for datetime type
        return dtype, tslibs.NaT

    # ... (other elif blocks remain unchanged)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    msg = "invalid dtype determination in get_concat_dtype"
    raise AssertionError(msg)
```

With the corrected code, the function should now correctly handle datetime types and return the appropriate dtype and NA values, resolving the issue observed in the failing test case.
