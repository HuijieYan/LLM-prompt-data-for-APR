The test case `test_merge_datetime_upcast_dtype` is testing the merging of the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames based on the "y" column, and the test is expecting the "z" column to have datetime values. However, the error message states that the "z" column has a dtype of "object" instead of "datetime64[ns]".

Based on the error message and the fact that the buggy function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` is used when concatenating specified units, it's likely that the bug originates from the data type determination when concatenating the DataFrames.

The bug occurs because the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function fails to correctly handle the case when the input units have different dtypes, e.g., when merging the "z" columns from the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle cases where the input units have different dtypes, such as datetime dtype.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    dtype = None
    na = None
    for unit in join_units:
        if unit.block is not None:
            if dtype is None or unit.block.dtype > dtype:
                dtype = unit.block.dtype
            if unit.block.is_na:
                na = unit.block.fill_value
    return dtype, na
```

This corrected version iterates through the `join_units` and selects the most permissive datatype for the result and also updates the 'na' value when necessary. This should handle the different dtype cases properly and provide the expected datetime dtype for the "z" column when merging the DataFrames.
