The potential error in the given function is that it's returning two values, `dtype` and `na`, which are not being utilized by the caller. Instead, the function should return a tuple containing `dtype` and `na`. 

The reason behind the bug might be a mismatch between the return type of the function and the expected type by the caller.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` should be modified to return a tuple of `dtype` and `na`. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple: (dtype, na)
    """
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        # FIXME: integrate property
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    # ... [remaining code]

    msg = "invalid dtype determination in get_concat_dtype"
    raise AssertionError(msg)
```
