This bug seems to be related to the `dtype` and `upcast_cls` values when the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` is executed, particularly when dealing with datetime objects. The error message in the test function indicates that the dtype for the column "z" is different, showing "object" on the left and "datetime64[ns]" on the right.

Upon analyzing the provided test case and the details of the bug, it seems that the bug is related to the incorrect determination of dtype when merging dataframes. This is most likely caused by the logic in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function, which determines the dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

The bug occurs due to the inconsistency in determining the dtype for the resulting dataframe, especially when merging datetime objects. This inconsistency leads to the dtype being converted to "object" in some cases.

To fix this bug, the logic for determining the dtype should be corrected to accurately identify the dtype of the resulting dataframe after merging. This could involve ensuring that the dtype is preserved when merging datetime objects and handling any edge cases where the dtype may be incorrectly determined.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    ...  # Other parts of the function remain unchanged

    # Fixed logic for determining dtype
    if "object" in upcast_classes:
        empty_dtype = np.dtype(np.object_)
        upcasted_na = np.nan
    elif "bool" in upcast_classes:
        if has_none_blocks:
            empty_dtype = np.dtype(np.object_)
            upcasted_na = np.nan
        else:
            empty_dtype = np.dtype(np.bool_)
            upcasted_na = None
    elif "category" in upcast_classes:
        empty_dtype = np.dtype(np.object_)
        upcasted_na = np.nan
    elif "datetimetz" in upcast_classes:
        empty_dtype = upcast_classes["datetimetz"][0]
        upcasted_na = tslibs.NaT
    elif "datetime" in upcast_classes:
        empty_dtype = np.dtype("M8[ns]")
        upcasted_na = tslibs.iNaT
    elif "timedelta" in upcast_classes:
        empty_dtype = np.dtype("m8[ns]")
        upcasted_na = np.timedelta64("NaT", "ns")
    else:
        try:
            g = np.find_common_type(upcast_classes, [])
        except TypeError:
            # At least one is an ExtensionArray
            empty_dtype = np.dtype(np.object_)
            upcasted_na = np.nan
        else:
            if is_float_dtype(g):
                empty_dtype = g
                upcasted_na = g.type(np.nan)
            elif is_numeric_dtype(g):
                if has_none_blocks:
                    empty_dtype = np.float64
                    upcasted_na = np.nan
                else:
                    empty_dtype = g
                    upcasted_na = None
    return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    msg = "invalid dtype determination in get_concat_dtype"
    raise AssertionError(msg)
```

In the corrected code, the logic for determining the dtype is revised to correctly identify the dtype of the resulting dataframe after merging, especially when dealing with datetime objects. This should address the bug and ensure that the dtype is preserved when merging dataframes.
