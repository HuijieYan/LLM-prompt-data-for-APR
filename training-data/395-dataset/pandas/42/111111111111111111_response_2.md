The bug occurs in the `assert_series_equal` function, specifically in the validation of whether `right` is an instance of `ExtensionArray`. The error message clearly indicates that `right` is not considered an `ExtensionArray`.

The bug occurs because when the `right` array has been converted to a different dtype, the function fails to recognize it as an `ExtensionArray` due to the change in dtype.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accommodate the comparison of different dtype arrays as well. This can be achieved by modifying the validation process to handle such cases.

The corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function is as follows:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # omitted code...

    if not check_dtype and isinstance(left, ExtensionArray):
        right = left._coerce_to_array(right)

    # omitted code...
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `check_dtype` is not enabled and if `left` is an `ExtensionArray`. If both conditions are met, we coerce the `right` array to ensure the dtype compatibility for comparison. This modification allows the function to handle cases where the dtypes of the input arrays may not match exactly before the comparison process.

This should address the bug related to the dtype comparison for extension dtypes in the `assert_series_equal` function.
