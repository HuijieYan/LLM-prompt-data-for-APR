The error occurs because the "assert_series_equal" and "assert_frame_equal" functions are trying to compare extension arrays and interval arrays using "isinstance" checks. However, instead of checking for ExtensionArray and IntervalArray, they are incorrectly checking for ExtensionArray and PandasArray. This mismatch causes the AssertionError.

To fix the bug, the "assert_isinstance" function should be updated to correctly check for extension arrays and interval arrays. Additionally, the "assert_series_equal" and "assert_frame_equal" functions should use the updated "assert_isinstance" function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _check_isinstance(left, right, cls):
    """
    Helper method for our assert_* methods that ensures that
    the two objects being compared have the right type before
    proceeding with the comparison.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : The first object being compared.
    right : The second object being compared.
    cls : The class type to check against.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError : Either `left` or `right` is not an instance of `cls`.
    """
    cls_name = cls.__name__

    if not isinstance(left, cls):
        raise AssertionError(
            f"{cls_name} Expected type {cls}, found {type(left)} instead"
        )
    if not isinstance(right, cls):
        raise AssertionError(
            f"{cls_name} Expected type {cls}, found {type(right)} instead"
        )
