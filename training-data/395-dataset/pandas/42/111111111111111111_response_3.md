The error occurs in the `assert_series_equal` function, specifically, in the part where it checks for extension array dtype equality.

The bug occurs due to changes made in the `assert_series_equal` function. Previously, the function was able to compare different extension array types when `check_dtype` was set to `False`. However, after recent changes, the function now tries to assert that both `left` and `right` are instances of `ExtensionArray`, leading to an assertion error when the second array is of a different type.

To fix the bug, the code needs to check for the extension array types only if `check_dtype` is `True`. If `check_dtype` is `False`, the code should not check for the extension array types and focus on comparing the values directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (omitted code)

    if check_dtype:
        assert isinstance(left, ExtensionArray), "left is not an ExtensionArray"
        assert isinstance(right, ExtensionArray), "right is not an ExtensionArray"

    # Existing code for value comparison without checking for ExtensionArray types

    # ... (remaining code)
```

With this correction, the `assert_series_equal` function will correctly compare extension array dtypes only when `check_dtype` is `True`. If `check_dtype` is `False`, it will proceed to compare the values directly without checking types, addressing the issue observed in the provided test cases and error messages.
