The bug is located in the function `assert_series_equal` from the file `_testing.py`. This function is used in the testing of pandas and is supposed to compare two Series objects to check for equality. The function has several parameters for checking different aspects of the Series, such as dtype, index type, series type, names, and others.

In the GitHub issue provided, the error seems to be related to the check_dtype parameter. The error message implies that the right object is not recognized as an ExtensionArray.

The reason behind the bug could be a failure in identifying whether the right object is an ExtensionArray, which leads to the AssertionError in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the conditions for recognizing an ExtensionArray and ensure that both left and right objects are correctly recognized as ExtensionArrays.
2. Review the logic for checking the dtype to handle ExtensionArrays properly.
3. Introduce additional checks to properly identify ExtensionArrays and handle them in the comparison logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    """
    Check that left and right Series are equal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same parameters as before) ...

    """
    # ... existing code ...

    if check_dtype:
        if is_extension_array_dtype(left) or is_extension_array_dtype(right):
            assert_extension_array_equal(left, right, check_dtype, check_less_precise, check_exact)
        else:
            assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj="Attributes of {obj}")

    # ... remaining code ...
    
```

In the corrected code, we introduce a specific check for ExtensionArrays before comparing the dtype, and handle ExtensionArrays accordingly in the comparison logic.
