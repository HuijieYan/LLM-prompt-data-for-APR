The error in the `assert_series_equal` method seems to occur at the following line:

```python
assert isinstance(right, ExtensionArray), "right is not an ExtensionArray"
```

It appears that the error message "right is not an ExtensionArray" is raised when comparing the extension dtypes between the left and right Series.

The reason behind this bug is that when the `check_dtype` is set to `True`, the comparison attempts to check if the right Series is an instance of the `ExtensionArray` class, which it is not, causing the AssertionError to be raised erroneously.

To fix this bug, the following approach can be considered:
- Update the comparison logic to check the dtype of the `right` Series and handle the comparison differently based on whether the dtype is an ExtensionArray or not.

Here's the corrected `assert_series_equal` function:
```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    """
    Check that left and right Series are equal.
    (Other parameters remain unchanged)
    """

    # ... (previous logic)

    # dtype comparison
    if check_dtype:
        if (is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype) and
            is_extension_array_dtype(right.dtype)):
            assert_extension_array_equal(
                left._values, right._values,
                check_dtype=check_dtype,
                check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
                check_exact=check_exact,
                obj=str(obj)
            )
        else:
            assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj=f"Attributes of {obj}")

    # ... (remaining logic)
```

This updated code introduces a conditional check to handle the comparison differently based on the right Series' dtype, avoiding the issue of directly comparing the Series as an ExtensionArray when it is not.
