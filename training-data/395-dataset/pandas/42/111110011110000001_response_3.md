The error occurs in the function `assert_series_equal()` when comparing series with different data types. The function fails when trying to compare ExtensionArrays, IntervalArrays, and their data types.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle comparisons involving ExtensionArrays and IntervalArrays properly. When comparing arrays with different data types and structures, the function is unable to handle the comparison and raises an AssertionError.

To fix the bug, the `assert_series_equal()` function should be updated to handle comparison scenarios involving ExtensionArrays and IntervalArrays. Additionally, it should include proper checks for the data type and structure of the arrays being compared.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pandas.core.series import Series

def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):

    # existing function code here

    if isinstance(left, Series) and isinstance(right, Series):
        if check_dtype:
            if left.dtype != right.dtype:
                raise AssertionError(f"Data types of series are different: {left.dtype}, {right.dtype}")

        if isinstance(left._values, ExtensionArray) and isinstance(right._values, ExtensionArray):
            assert_extension_array_equal(left._values, right._values, check_dtype=check_dtype, obj=str(obj))
        elif isinstance(left._values, IntervalArray) or isinstance(right._values, IntervalArray):
            assert_interval_array_equal(left._values, right._values)
        else:
            _testing.assert_almost_equal(
                left._values,
                right._values,
                check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
                check_dtype=check_dtype,
                obj=str(obj),
            )

    # remaining code
```

In the corrected function, additional checks are added for the data type and structure of the Series being compared, specifically for ExtensionArrays and IntervalArrays. This allows the function to handle comparisons involving these specialized array types and their data types, resolving the issue.
