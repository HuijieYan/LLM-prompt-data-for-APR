This bug is likely occurring due to a change in behavior related to extension dtypes in the `assert_frame_equal` and `assert_series_equal` functions, particularly when `check_dtype` is set to False. The bug results in an AssertionError stating that "right is not an ExtensionArray".

The error is likely occurring in the `assert_extension_array_equal` function within the `assert_series_equal` function. This is because the `assert_extension_array_equal` function expects both `left` and `right` parameters to be instances of `ExtensionArray`. However, in the case when `check_dtype` is set to False, the `right` parameter is not being treated as an ExtensionArray as expected, thereby causing the AssertionError.

To fix this bug, the handling of the `right` parameter within the `assert_series_equal` function needs to be adjusted when `check_dtype` is set to False. If the `check_dtype` is False, the assertion related to ExtensionArray should be skipped.

Here's the corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    """
    Check that left and right Series are equal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (other parameters remain the same)
    """
    __tracebackhide__ = True

    # instance validation
    _check_isinstance(left, right, Series)

    if check_series_type:
        assert_class_equal(left, right, obj=obj)

    # ... (omitted length comparison)

    if check_dtype:
        if (
            is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype)
            and is_extension_array_dtype(right.dtype)
            and not isinstance(right, ExtensionArray)
        ):
            pass  # Skip assertion related to ExtensionArray
        else:
            assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj=f"Attributes of {obj}")

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition is added after the `check_dtype` block to skip the assertion related to `ExtensionArray` if `right` is not an instance of `ExtensionArray` when `check_dtype` is False.

This should resolve the bug and ensure proper handling of the `right` parameter when `check_dtype` is set to False.
