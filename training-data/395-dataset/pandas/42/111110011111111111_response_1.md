## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `assert_extension_array_equal` function within the `assert_series_equal` function is failing due to an `AssertionError: right is not an ExtensionArray`. This suggests that the `right` object is not recognized as an ExtensionArray, leading to the comparison failure.

## Potential Error Location
The error is likely occurring within the `assert_extension_array_equal` function, specifically in the assertion statement `assert isinstance(right, ExtensionArray)`.

## Reason behind the Bug
The bug occurs because the `right` object is not correctly recognized as an `ExtensionArray`, resulting in the comparison failure.

## Possible Approaches
To fix the bug, the type of the `right` object needs to be identified correctly as an `ExtensionArray` before the comparison operation is performed. This can be achieved by ensuring that the `right` object is indeed recognized as an `ExtensionArray` as intended.

## Corrected Code
```python
def assert_series_equal(left, right, check_dtype=True, check_index_type="equiv", check_series_type=True, check_less_precise=False, check_names=True, check_exact=False, check_datetimelike_compat=False, check_categorical=True, check_category_order=True, obj="Series"):
    __tracebackhide__ = True

    # instance validation
    _check_isinstance(left, right, Series)

    if check_series_type:
        assert_class_equal(left, right, obj=obj)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    
    # metadata comparison
    if check_names:
        assert_attr_equal("name", left, right, obj=obj)

    if check_categorical:
        if is_categorical_dtype(left) or is_categorical_dtype(right):
            left_values = getattr(left, "_values", None)
            right_values = getattr(right, "_values", None)
            if left_values is not None and right_values is not None:
                assert_categorical_equal(
                    left_values,
                    right_values,
                    obj=f"{obj} category",
                    check_category_order=check_category_order,
                )
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to ensure that both `left_values` and `right_values` are present as attributes before calling the `assert_categorical_equal` function. This change is designed to address the bug by handling cases where the `right` object may not be recognized as an `ExtensionArray`.
