The test case "test_assert_frame_equal_extension_dtype_mismatch" is trying to compare two DataFrames with different dtypes and is expecting an AssertionError. It seems that the issue is related to comparing ExtensionArray dtypes.

The test case "test_assert_frame_equal_interval_dtype_mismatch" and other similar test cases are also trying to compare columns with different dtypes, resulting in AttributeErrors related to the "IntervalArray" and "ExtensionArray".

Similarly, the test cases "test_assert_series_equal_extension_dtype_mismatch" and "test_assert_series_equal_interval_dtype_mismatch" are trying to compare Series with different dtypes, leading to AttributeErrors.

The potential error location is within the "assert_series_equal" function, specifically in the parts where it compares dtypes and tries to assert the type of the arrays against "ExtensionArray" and "IntervalArray".

The bug occurs because the function is not handling comparisons involving ExtensionArray and IntervalArray correctly. It tries to assert the type of the arrays against "ExtensionArray" and "IntervalArray", but the actual types being compared are different (e.g., "PandasArray").

To fix the bug, the function "assert_series_equal" should be modified to handle comparisons involving ExtensionArray and IntervalArray correctly. It should also perform proper validation of the array types being compared.

Here's the corrected code for the "assert_series_equal" function:

```python
from pandas import Series
from pandas.core.arrays.interval import IntervalArray
from pandas._testing import _check_isinstance, assert_extension_array_equal, assert_interval_array_equal

def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if is_interval_dtype(left.dtype) or is_interval_dtype(right.dtype):
        assert_interval_array_equal(left.array, right.array)
    elif is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype) or is_extension_array_dtype(right.dtype):
        assert_extension_array_equal(left._values, right._values)
        
    # ... (omitted code) ...
```

In the corrected code, the "assert_series_equal" function has been updated to correctly handle comparisons involving ExtensionArray and IntervalArray. The correct methods for comparing IntervalArray and ExtensionArray are now called based on the dtype of the arrays being compared.
