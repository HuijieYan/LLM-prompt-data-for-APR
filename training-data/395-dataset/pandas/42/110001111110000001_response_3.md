The error message from the test function indicates that the `right` object is not recognized as an ExtensionArray, which is required for the comparison in the assert_extension_array_equal function. This is likely due to the incorrect conversion of the `right` object to a different type, causing the AssertionError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `right` object is converted to the correct type to be recognized as an ExtensionArray for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        right = pd.Series(right)  # Convert to a Pandas Series object

    # ... (remaining code remains the same) ...
```
