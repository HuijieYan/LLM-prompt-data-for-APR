The provided function, assert_series_equal, is used to compare two Series objects. It checks for various attributes such as dtype, index type, names, and other properties to determine if the two Series are equal.

In the associated detailed issue description, the user is comparing two DataFrames, and the comparison fails with an AssertionError related to ExtensionArray. The specific error message is "right is not an ExtensionArray."

Given that the error occurs within the assert_extension_array_equal function, it's evident that there is a problem with handling ExtensionArray objects. The assert_extension_array_equal function is not correctly identifying the right input as an ExtensionArray.

The bug occurs because the current implementation does not properly handle the comparison of ExtensionArray objects, leading to the mismatch and the subsequent assertion failure.

To fix this, the assert_extension_array_equal function needs to be updated to correctly check whether both inputs are ExtensionArray objects before performing the comparison logic.

Here's the corrected code for the assert_series_equal function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    __tracebackhide__ = True

    _check_isinstance(left, right, Series)

    if check_series_type:
        assert_class_equal(left, right, obj=obj)

    if check_dtype and not is_extension_array_dtype(left) and not is_extension_array_dtype(right):
        assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj=f"Attributes of {obj}")

    # rest of the comparisons and checks...

    # Updated logic for ExtensionArray comparison
    if is_extension_array_dtype(left) and is_extension_array_dtype(right):
        assert_extension_array_equal(left, right, check_dtype=check_dtype, check_less_precise=check_less_precise, check_exact=check_exact)

    # rest of the comparisons and checks...
```

In the updated code, before comparing the dtype attribute, it checks whether the inputs are ExtensionArray objects and handles the comparison accordingly. This ensures that the correct comparison logic is applied for ExtensionArray objects, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
