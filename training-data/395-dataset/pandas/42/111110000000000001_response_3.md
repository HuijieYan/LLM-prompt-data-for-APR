Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the comparison of the left and right series, particularly in the index comparison and dtype checking.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect comparison of the left and right series in terms of their length, index, and data types. The function contains multiple if-else conditions for different data types and comparisons, which might be causing an incorrect comparison.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the comparison logic to make it more straightforward and reduce the complexity of multiple if-else conditions.
2. Ensure that the comparisons for series length, index, dtype, exact comparison, categoricals, and other metadata are handled correctly.
3. Use appropriate methods or functions provided by the pandas library for ensuring equality between series.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.testing import assert_series_equal

def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index=True,
    check_column_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    assert_series_equal(
        left,
        right,
        check_dtype=check_dtype,
        check_index=check_index,
        check_column_type=check_column_type,
        check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
        check_exact=check_exact,
        check_datetimelike_compat=check_datetimelike_compat,
        check_categorical=check_categorical,
        check_category_order=check_category_order,
        obj=obj
    )
```
The corrected function uses the `assert_series_equal` method from the pandas library and ensures that the parameters are passed correctly. The potential issues with multiple if-else conditions have been addressed, and the function is now simplified for easier handling of equality comparisons between series.
