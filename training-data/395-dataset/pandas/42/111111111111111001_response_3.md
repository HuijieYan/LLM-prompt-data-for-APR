The error messages indicate that the `assert_series_equal` and `assert_frame_equal` functions are failing due to incorrect type assertion. The assertion statements in the `_check_isinstance` function are not comparing the correct types of the arrays.

The reason for the bug is that the `_check_isinstance` function is not recognizing the correct type of the arrays being compared, resulting in an incorrect assertion failure.

To fix the bug, the `_check_isinstance` function should be modified to correctly check the type of the arrays being compared.

Here's the corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    _check_isinstance(left, right, Series)  # corrected line

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...
```

The corrected code ensures that the correct type of arrays is being checked in the `_check_isinstance` function, which will resolve the type assertion issues.
