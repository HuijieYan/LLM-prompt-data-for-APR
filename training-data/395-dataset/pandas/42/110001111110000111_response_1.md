The error messages indicate that there are issues with checking extension dtypes in the `assert_series_equal` and `assert_frame_equal` functions. These issues arise with the introduction of a new dtype conversion process in the code, leading to failures in the existing checks for extension dtypes.

The potential error location is within the part of the code that checks the extension dtypes and their comparison.

The issue occurs because with the introduction of the new dtype conversion process, the existing checks for extension dtypes are no longer functioning as expected.

To fix the bug:
1. The `assert_extension_array_equal` and `_check_isinstance` functions should be modified to handle the extension dtypes check appropriately.
2. The `assert_series_equal` function should be updated to address the issues related to extension dtypes comparison, ensuring that it checks for the correct type of extension array.
3. The parameters and conditions in the `assert_series_equal` function must be aligned with the new dtype conversion process.

Here is the corrected `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (existing code) ...
    if is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype) and is_extension_array_dtype(right.dtype):
        assert_extension_array_equal(left._values, right._values, check_dtype=check_dtype)
    else:
        _testing.assert_almost_equal(
            left._values,
            right._values,
            check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
            check_dtype=check_dtype,
            obj=str(obj),
        )
    # ... (existing code) ...
```

This corrected `assert_series_equal` function includes the necessary checks for extension array types and ensures that the comparison is performed correctly.
