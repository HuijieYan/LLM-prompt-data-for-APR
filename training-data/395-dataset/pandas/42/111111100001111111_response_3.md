The input for the given function `assert_series_equal` is two `Series` objects along with several boolean and string parameters. The function aims to check the equality of the left and right series based on various criteria such as dtype, index type, series type, etc.

The error occurs due to a problem in the data type comparison. The function tries to compare two series where one series has an extension dtype (e.g., Int64) and the other series has an object dtype. This comparison causes an assertion error because the method `assert_extension_array_equal` expects both `left` and `right` to be `ExtensionArray` instances.

The possible approach to fix this bug is to change the comparison logic to handle different dtype comparisons more gracefully. One way to approach this could be to modify the logic within the function `assert_series_equal` to appropriately handle the comparison between different dtypes and extension arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `assert_series_equal`:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    """
    Check that left and right Series are equal.

    ... (other parameters and documentation remains the same)

    """
    __tracebackhide__ = True

    # instance validation
    _check_isinstance(left, right, Series)

    if check_series_type:
        assert_class_equal(left, right, obj=obj)

    # length comparison
    if len(left) != len(right):
        msg1 = f"{len(left)}, {left.index}"
        msg2 = f"{len(right)}, {right.index}"
        raise_assert_detail(obj, "Series length are different", msg1, msg2)

    # index comparison
    assert_index_equal(
        left.index,
        right.index,
        exact=check_index_type,
        check_names=check_names,
        check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
        check_exact=check_exact,
        check_categorical=check_categorical,
        obj=f"{obj}.index",
    )

    if check_dtype:
        # Handle different dtypes more gracefully
        if not check_categorical:
            assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj=f"Attributes of {obj}")
        else:
            # Handle extension array comparison
            if hasattr(left, "_values") and hasattr(right, "_values"):
                assert_extension_array_equal(left, right, check_dtype, check_less_precise, check_exact)

    # ... (other comparisons and checks remain the same)

```

This corrected code introduces a conditional logic to handle different dtypes more gracefully and specifically handle the comparison of extension arrays. This change should address the assertion error related to extension array comparison.
