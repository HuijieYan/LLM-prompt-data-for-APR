The potential error location within the function is the `assert_index_equal` function call which raises an assertion error if the left and right indices are not exactly equal.

The error occurs because the function `assert_series_equal` does not correctly handle differences in the order of the index labels. It expects the indices of both series to be in the exact same order, which may not always be the case.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the `assert_index_equal` function to check for the equality of labels regardless of order. This can be done by sorting the index labels before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function incorporating the fix:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    
    # index comparison
    # Sort index labels before comparison to handle differences in order
    assert_index_equal(
        left.index.sort_values(),
        right.index.sort_values(),
        exact=check_index_type,
        check_names=check_names,
        check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
        check_exact=check_exact,
        check_categorical=check_categorical,
        obj=f"{obj}.index",
    )

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

This modification ensures that the comparison of indices is based on the values rather than their order, addressing the potential bug related to index comparison in the original function.
