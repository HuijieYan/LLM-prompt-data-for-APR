The error occurs when the `pd.merge_asof` function is called within the test case. The error message indicates that the tolerance must be an integer, timestamp, or float, but it's currently a Timedelta object, causing the `MergeError` to be raised.

The root cause of the bug is that the `_get_merge_keys` method does not handle the case where the index is a TimedeltaIndex properly. As a result, it raises a `MergeError` when a Timedelta object is used as the tolerance value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_merge_keys` method to handle the case where the index is a TimedeltaIndex properly. Specifically, we need to add a check for the type of the tolerance value and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate tolerance for TimedeltaIndex
    if self.tolerance is not None and isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
        if not all(is_number(val) for val in self.tolerance):
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be integer, timestamp or float")

    # Additional handling for other types of indexes can be added here

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to validate the tolerance for a TimedeltaIndex. If the tolerance is not None and is an instance of Timedelta, we check if all its values are numbers. If not, it raises a `MergeError` with the appropriate message.

This correction should resolve the issue and allow the `pd.merge_asof` function to work properly with a TimedeltaIndex.
