The error occurs when a specific type of merge operation is being performed using the pd.merge_asof() function, and the tolerance parameter is not being handled correctly in the _get_merge_keys() method. The method is supposed to extract merge keys, validate their compatibility, validate the tolerance, and then return the merge keys. However, it currently raises a MergeError with the message "key must be integer, timestamp or float" when it should be validating and handling the tolerance parameter.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the tolerance parameter correctly. It fails to accurately identify and process the tolerance parameter, leading to the incorrect error being raised.

To fix the bug, the _get_merge_keys() method needs to be modified to correctly validate the tolerance parameter. This includes checking if it is a timedelta if the left index is not set and handling it appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the _get_merge_keys() method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):

    # ... omitted code ...

    # validate tolerance; must be a Timedelta if we have a timedelta index
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if (is_datetime64_dtype(lt) or is_datetime64tz_dtype(lt)) and not isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be a Timedelta")
        
        elif is_int64_dtype(lt) and (not is_integer(self.tolerance) or self.tolerance < 0):
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be a positive integer")

        elif is_float_dtype(lt) and (not is_number(self.tolerance) or self.tolerance < 0):
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be a positive float")

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

This corrected method handles the tolerance parameter correctly by checking its type and value based on the type of the keys involved in the merge operation.
