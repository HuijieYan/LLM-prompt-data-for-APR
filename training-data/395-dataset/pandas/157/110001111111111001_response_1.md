The error message occurred at the line `raise MergeError("key must be integer, timestamp or float")` within the function `_get_merge_keys`. This suggests that the tolerance check is failing and raising an error because the tolerance value is not of the expected type or format.

The potential error location is likely in the tolerance value check within the `_get_merge_keys` function.

The bug occurred because the tolerance was expected to be a Timedelta object for a datetime index (`lt`), but the comparison and type checks did not cover all possible cases.

To fix the bug, the tolerance value should be properly checked for its type and compatibility:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):

    # ... (other code)

    # validate tolerance; must be a Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        # Simplifying the check and error message
        if not isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be a Timedelta object")
        if self.tolerance < Timedelta(0):
            raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

    # ... (the rest of the code)

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

By simply checking if the tolerance is an instance of Timedelta and providing a clear error message, we can ensure that the tolerance value is correct and prevent the error from occurring.
