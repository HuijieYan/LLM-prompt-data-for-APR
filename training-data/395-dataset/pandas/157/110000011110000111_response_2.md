The test case is trying to merge two DataFrames using the `merge_asof` function with a tolerance of 1 millisecond and direction set to "nearest". However, it's encountering an error related to the tolerance and the type of index used in the DataFrames.

The potential error location within the `_get_merge_keys` function is the validation for tolerance when the index is a Timedelta.

The bug is occurring because the function is not handling the case where the index is a Timedelta. It's trying to validate the tolerance using logic for datetime, int64, and float types, but it's not considering the case where the index is a Timedelta.

To fix the bug, the function should include a branch to handle the case where the index is a Timedelta. It should validate the tolerance based on the Timedelta index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        lt = left_join_keys[-1]
        if is_timedelta64_dtype(lt):
            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
                raise MergeError("Tolerance must be a Timedelta when the index is a Timedelta")
            if self.tolerance < Timedelta(0):
                raise MergeError("Tolerance must be positive")
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    
    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
``` 

With this correction, the `_get_merge_keys` function now handles the case where the index is a Timedelta and correctly validates the tolerance based on the Timedelta index type.
