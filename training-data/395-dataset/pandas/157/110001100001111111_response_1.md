The error message "incompatible tolerance {tolerance}, must be compat with type {lkdtype}" suggests that there is a compatibility issue with the tolerance flag when the index is a Timedelta. This implies that the bug is likely located in the conditional check for the tolerance and the type of the index. The bug probably occurs because the function is not handling the case where the index is a TimedeltaIndex properly, leading to the tolerance value not being compatible with the index type.

To fix this bug, the function must be updated to appropriately handle the case where the index is a TimedeltaIndex. This would involve checking the type of the index and ensuring that the tolerance is compatible with it.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_timedelta64_ns_dtype
from pandas.errors import MergeError

def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                msg = (
                    f"incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lk.dtype} and "
                    f"{rk.dtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones"
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    f"incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lk.dtype} and "
                    f"{rk.dtype}, must be the same type"
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if is_timedelta64_ns_dtype(left_join_keys[-1].dtype):
            if not is_timedelta64_ns_dtype(self.tolerance):
                raise MergeError(
                    f"incompatible tolerance {self.tolerance}, must be compatible with type {left_join_keys[-1].dtype}"
                )
            if self.tolerance < pd.Timedelta(0):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")
        else:
            raise MergeError("key must be integer, timestamp or float")

    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        raise MergeError(f"allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {self.allow_exact_matches}")

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code:
- The function `is_timedelta64_ns_dtype` is used to check whether the index type is a TimedeltaIndex.
- The conditional check for `self.tolerance` now specifically handles the case where the index is a TimedeltaIndex. If the index is a TimedeltaIndex, it checks that the tolerance is also a Timedelta and ensures it is positive.
- The last conditional check verifies that the index type must be integer, timestamp, or float.

This should address the issue of using the tolerance flag when the index is a TimedeltaIndex, as described in the GitHub issue.
