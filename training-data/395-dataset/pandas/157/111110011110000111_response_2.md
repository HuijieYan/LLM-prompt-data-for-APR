The error message indicated that the key must be an integer, timestamp, or float, but the code provided did not consider timedelta as a valid type for the key.

The potential error is occurring in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class. The method is checking for the compatibility of the key type and validity of the tolerance, but it is not considering timedelta as a valid key type.

The bug occurred because the `_get_merge_keys` method did not handle the case where the key type is a timedelta.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_merge_keys` method to handle timedelta as a valid key type and adjust the tolerance validation accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... previous code ...

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                #
                # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                # for them here.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate tolerance; timedelta is a valid type
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if is_datetime64_dtype(left_join_keys[-1]):
            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be a Timedelta")
            if self.tolerance < Timedelta(0):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")

    # ... remaining code ...
    
    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code, we added a conditional check for `is_datetime64_dtype` to handle timedelta as a valid index type for checking tolerance. This modification ensures that timedelta is considered a valid index type and that the tolerance validation is adjusted accordingly.
