Potential Error Location: The error might occur in the conditional statement for isinstance(other, Series) as it is checking for a Series object, but the Series class might not be imported.

Reasons for Bug: The bug might be caused because the Series class is not imported, and the code is checking for the presence of a Series object.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The bug can be fixed by importing the Series class and also handling the case when a non-DataFrame or non-Series object is passed as 'other'.

```python
from pandas import Series

def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    elif isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        # Handle non-DataFrame or non-Series object
        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input type for 'other'")
