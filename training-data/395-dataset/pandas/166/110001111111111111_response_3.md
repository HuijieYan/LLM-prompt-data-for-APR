The error message indicates that the warning is not being suppressed even when the `sort` argument is set to `False`. This suggests that the issue lies within the `_join_compat` function, and specifically in the part where `sort` is being handled.

The issue most likely occurs because the `sort` parameter is being handled incorrectly within the `_join_compat` function, causing the warning to be triggered regardless of its value.

To resolve the bug, the part of the code that checks for the value of `sort` and determines how to handle the concatenation needs to be modified. It seems that the issue arises because the `sort` parameter is not being correctly handled when the data is concatenated.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.series import Series
    from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
            )

        return joined
```

The changes include adding the `sort` parameter to the `concat` function calls and `merge` function calls to ensure that the `sort` value is properly propagated throughout the concatenation and merging process. This should fix the bug and allow the warning to be correctly suppressed when `sort=False` is specified.
