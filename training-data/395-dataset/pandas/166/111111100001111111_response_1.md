The issue is with the `_join_compat` function inside the `DataFrame` class. This function is used to perform a join operation between two DataFrames or between a DataFrame and a list of DataFrames. The problem arises when the `sort` parameter is set to `False`, as the warning related to future behavior persists.

The reason behind the bug is that the condition to check for `sort` and perform the concatenation with `can_concat` is missing. This leads to the warning message related to sorting, even when `sort=False` is explicitly passed.

To fix this bug, the code inside the `_join_compat` function needs to be modified to handle the `sort` parameter correctly and perform concatenation with the `can_concat` condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat with proper handling of sort
        if can_concat:
            if sort:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=False)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

This corrected code includes proper handling of the `sort` parameter when performing concatenation and ensures that the warning related to the future behavior is no longer displayed when `sort=False`.
