The error seems to be related to the FutureWarning being caused by the `sort` parameter in the `join` method of the `DataFrame` class. The warning suggests that a future version of pandas will change to not sort by default and provides instructions on how to accept the future behavior or retain the current behavior and silence the warning.

The error points to line 7216 in the file `pandas/core/frame.py`, which is where the `sort` parameter is likely being handled. It seems that the `sort` parameter is being passed to another method which is causing the warning.

To fix this issue, the code in the `_join_compat` method where the `sort` parameter is handled needs to be revised to handle the warning according to the instructions provided. Specifically, the warning related to the `FutureWarning` should be addressed and handled as per the instructions in the warning message.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort, # Pass sort parameter to the merge method
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

In this corrected code, the `sort` parameter is passed to the `merge` method directly, which would handle the parameter and any resulting warnings according to its implementation.
