The test case is designed to check if a warning is raised when joining DataFrames. The error message indicates that a warning is being raised unexpectedly and the test is failing due to the raised warning.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the `sort=sort_kw` parameter passed to the `join` method. This seems to be causing the warning to be raised unexpectedly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is related to the implementation of the `join` method in the DataFrame class. The handling of the `sort` parameter might be causing the warning to be raised unexpectedly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the way the `sort` parameter is handled in the `join` method and ensuring that it behaves as expected without raising unnecessary warnings.

Here's the corrected code for the `DataFrame` class with the modified `_join_compat` function:

```python
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    # ... (other code) ...

    def _join_compat(
        self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=None
    ):
        from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
        from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

        if isinstance(other, Series):
            if other.name is None:
                raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
            other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

        if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
            return merge(
                self,
                other,
                left_on=on,
                how=how,
                left_index=on is None,
                right_index=True,
                suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
                sort=sort,
            )
        else:
            if on is not None:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
                )

            frames = [self] + list(other)

            can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

            # join indexes only using concat
            if can_concat:
                if how == "left":
                    res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                    return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
                else:
                    return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

            joined = frames[0]

            for frame in frames[1:]:
                joined = merge(
                    joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
                )

            return joined
```

In the corrected code, the `sort` parameter is modified to be passed to the `merge` function within the appropriate conditional branches, allowing for proper handling of the `sort` behavior without unexpected warnings being raised.
