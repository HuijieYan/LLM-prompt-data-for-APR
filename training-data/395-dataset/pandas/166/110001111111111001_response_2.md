The error occurs when the `join` method is called with `sort` set to `True`. The error message indicates that a `FutureWarning` is being produced due to the specified sorting behavior.

The error is likely to be in the `_join_compat` function, specifically when it handles the `sort` parameter. The error occurs because the `sort` parameter is being passed directly to the `concat` function without considering the case when `sort` is explicitly set to `True`.

To fix this issue, the `_join_compat` function should handle the `sort` parameter properly by checking its value and altering the behavior accordingly. When `sort` is explicitly set to `True`, a `FutureWarning` is produced, indicating that the future behavior of pandas will change to not sort by default. Therefore, the corrected code should address this warning by passing `sort=False` explicitly when `sort` is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,  # pass the sort parameter to the merge function
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if sort == True:  # explicit sorting
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=False)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
        
        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

The corrected code addresses the warning by explicitly passing `sort=False` when `sort` is set to `True` and ensuring that the `concat` function behaves accordingly.
