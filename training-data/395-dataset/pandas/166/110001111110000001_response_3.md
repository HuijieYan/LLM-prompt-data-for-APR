The error message `Caused unexpected warning(s): [('FutureWarning', FutureWarning("Sorting because non-concatenation axis is not aligned...` suggests that the warning related to sorting during concatenation is being triggered unexpectedly. This indicates that the issue may be related to how sorting is handled within the `_join_compat` function.

Upon examining the `_join_compat` function, it appears that the bug is caused by the way the `sort` argument is being handled when calling the `merge` and `concat` functions.

The error message indicates that the warning is related to the sort behavior during concatenation. This can be resolved by properly handling the `sort` parameter in the `concat` function call.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `sort` behavior is properly handled when calling the `concat` function. Specifically, we need to pass the `sort` parameter to the `concat` function based on the value of the `sort` argument received by the `_join_compat` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,  # Pass the sort argument to the merge function
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)  # Pass the sort argument to the concat function
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)  # Pass the sort argument to the concat function

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort  # Pass the sort argument to the merge function
            )

        return joined
```

By properly passing the `sort` argument to the `merge` and `concat` functions based on the input received by the `_join_compat` function, we can address the bug related to the FutureWarning during concatenation.
