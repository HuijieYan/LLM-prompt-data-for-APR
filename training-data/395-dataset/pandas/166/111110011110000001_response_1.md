The error seems to occur when the `result = a.join([b, c], how="outer", sort=sort_kw)` statement is executed.

The issue comes from the `_join_compat` method in the `DataFrame` class. The error message indicates a warning related to sorting. The method `_join_compat` tries to join multiple DataFrames and allows for specifying the sort behavior. However, it appears that the warning is being raised in relation to the sort option not being specified correctly.

To fix this, the `sort` parameter in the `_join_compat` method should be handled appropriately to align with the test case. The warning indicates that to suppress the warning, the `sort` parameter should be set to `False`. Therefore, the `sort` parameter should be passed through to the underlying `concat` function while joining the DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` method:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    # existing code ...

    with ctx:
        if sort:
            result = a.join([b, c], how="outer")
        else:
            result = a.join([b, c], how="outer", sort=False)
    tm.assert_frame_equal(result, expected)
```

In this correction, the `sort` parameter is being passed to the `a.join` method, allowing the `sort` parameter to be handled appropriately while joining DataFrames.
