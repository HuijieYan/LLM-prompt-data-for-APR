The problematic function is `_join_compat` within the `DataFrame` class. The bug is that the function is trying to import the `merge` and `concat` functions from the wrong location, causing them not to be found.

The reason for this bug is that the function is trying to import the `merge` and `concat` functions from the wrong module. The correct module for these functions is `pandas.core.reshape.merge`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the import statements for `merge` and `concat` to import them from the correct module.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected code for the buggy function
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat
    from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
    from pandas.core.series import Series

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```
