Potential error location: 
The error may occur in the `if isinstance(other, Series):` block, where a DataFrame is created from the other Series with the same name. This could lead to a ValueError being raised if the other Series does not have a name.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the other Series does not have a name, leading to the ValueError being raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the other Series has a name before creating a DataFrame from it.
2. Handle the case where the other Series does not have a name.

Corrected code:

```python
# Correction for the buggy function
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
