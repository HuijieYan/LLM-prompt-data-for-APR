Potential error location: The error might occur when trying to join multiple DataFrames as the current implementation only supports joining on the index.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely due to the limitation in the implementation of the function, where joining multiple DataFrames is only supported for joining on the index. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle joining on columns for multiple DataFrames.
2. Implement a check for whether the join is being performed on the index or columns, and then handle the joining accordingly.
3. Update the error message to inform the user about the limitations of the current implementation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        if on is None:
            return merge(
                self,
                other,
                left_index=True,
                right_index=True,
                how=how,
                suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
                sort=sort,
            )
        else:
            return merge(
                self,
                other,
                left_on=on,
                right_index=True,
                how=how,
                suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
                sort=sort,
            )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```
