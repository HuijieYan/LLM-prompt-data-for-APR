It appears that the issue is related to the warning message generated when using the `join` method with the `sort` parameter set to `False`. The warning specifically mentions sorting because the non-concatenation axis is not aligned.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that determines whether the warning should be silenced based on the value of the `sort` parameter.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement for determining whether the warning should be silenced based on the `sort` parameter is not functioning as expected.

To fix this bug, a possible approach would be to modify the conditional statement to correctly evaluate the `sort` parameter and determine whether the warning should be silenced based on its value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, pd.Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = pd.DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, pd.DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
            )

        return joined
```
In the corrected function, the `sort` parameter is correctly passed to the `concat` and `merge` functions based on its value, and the warning should be silenced as expected.
