The test case 'test_suppress_future_warning_with_sort_kw' is selecting different values for the 'sort_kw' parameter and checking for expected behavior. The error message indicates that the warning is not being suppressed as expected when the 'sort_kw' parameter is set to False.

The potential error location in the 'join' function is in the handling of the 'sort' parameter. It seems that the handling of the 'sort' parameter is not correct, leading to the warning not being suppressed as expected.

The bug occurs because the 'sort' parameter is not being used correctly in the 'join' function. The warning is related to sorting because non-concatenation axis is not aligned, and the 'sort' parameter should control this behavior.

To fix the bug, the 'sort' parameter should be passed correctly to the underlying pandas merge or concat functions based on the input type. If it is a DataFrame, it should be passed to the merge function, and if it is a list of objects, concat should be used. The 'sort' parameter should be maintained and properly handled during the merge or concatenation operation.

Here is the corrected 'join' function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
            )

        return joined
```

In the corrected code, the 'sort' parameter is passed to the 'merge' and 'concat' functions as appropriate. This should address the issue of the warning not being suppressed when 'sort' is set to False.
