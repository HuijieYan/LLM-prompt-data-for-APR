The error occurs when using the `join` method on a DataFrame and passing the `sort` parameter as `True`. The error message indicates that a future version of pandas will change to not sort by default.

The problematic function is `_join_compat`, which appears to be a private method used internally by the `DataFrame` class to handle joins with other DataFrames or Series. The issue may stem from the incorrect handling of the `sort` parameter in the function, leading to the unexpected warning.

To fix this issue, the `_join_compat` function should be updated to address the handling of the `sort` parameter according to the future behavior of pandas. This could involve explicitly setting `sort` to `True` or `False` based on the warning message for the current behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        # Update the sort parameter based on the future behavior warning
        if sort is None:
            sort = True  # Set sort to True for the current behavior
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

In the corrected code, we've added a conditional check for the `sort` parameter to ensure it aligns with the future behavior warning. If `sort` is `None`, we set it to `True` to retain the current behavior and silence the warning as mentioned in the warning message.

With the above approach, the function should handle the `sort` parameter appropriately and address the issue observed in the error messages during testing.
