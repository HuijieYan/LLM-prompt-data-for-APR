The error occurs when running the test function `test_suppress_future_warning_with_sort_kw`, which expects that passing `sort=False` to the `join` function would suppress the warning. However, the test function encounters an unexpected warning message, indicating that the warning is not being suppressed as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_join_compat` method, specifically when handling the `sort` parameter.

The issue arises because the `_join_compat` method does not correctly handle the `sort` parameter when performing the join operation. This causes the warning related to sorting to be displayed, regardless of the value passed for the `sort` parameter.

To fix the bug, the `_join_compat` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the `sort` parameter, ensuring that the warning related to sorting is suppressed when `sort` is set to `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` method:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    if can_concat:
        if how == "left":
            res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
            return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
        else:
            return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

    joined = frames[0]

    for frame in frames[1:]:
        joined = merge(
            joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
        )

    return joined
```

By incorporating the `sort` parameter into the relevant operations, the corrected function should suppress the warning message when `sort=False` is passed to the `join` function and ensure the expected output is achieved.
