The issue is occurring when the `sort` parameter is set to `False` in the `DataFrame.join()` method. This is causing a FutureWarning to be triggered.

The bug is likely in the `_join_compat` function of the `DataFrame` class, as this function is responsible for performing the join operation when multiple dataframes are passed. The error seems to be related to the sorting behavior when the `sort` parameter is set to `False`.

The issue is occurring because the code does not handle the `sort` parameter correctly when joining multiple dataframes. This results in the FutureWarning being triggered, even when `sort=False` is explicitly specified.

To fix this bug, the `_join_compat` function should be modified to handle the `sort` parameter properly. When `sort=False` is specified, the code should not trigger the FutureWarning related to sorting.

Here is the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    # ... existing code ...

    if can_concat:
        if how == "left":
            res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
            return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
        else:
            return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

    # ... existing code ...
```

By adding the `sort` parameter to the `concat` function calls and passing `sort` to these calls, the corrected function should now handle the `sort` parameter correctly when joining multiple dataframes.

This should fix the issue and ensure that the FutureWarning related to sorting is properly handled based on the value of the `sort` parameter.
