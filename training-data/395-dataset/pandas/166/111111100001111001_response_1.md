The bug occurs in the `_join_compat` function. This function is supposed to merge two DataFrames or concatenate them if on parameter is not specified. However, the bug occurs when the `sort` parameter is set to False. When `sort` is False, the code incorrectly sets `can_concat` to True, which leads to the wrong execution path in the subsequent logic.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly determine whether to merge or concatenate the DataFrames based on the `sort` parameter value. If `sort` is False, we should only concatenate the DataFrames and not attempt to perform a merge operation.

Below is the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, pd.Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = pd.DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if how == "outer" and not sort:
        return concat([self, other], axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
    else:
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check for the conditions where `sort` is False and `how` is "outer" to perform only a concatenation operation. Otherwise, we proceed with the merge operation as before.
