The bug in the provided function is related to the `DataFrame.join` method which is called within the function. The error messages from the test functions indicate that the problem is related to the `sort` parameter. The FutureWarning states that a future version of pandas will change to not sort by default, and it suggests passing 'sort=False' to accept the future behavior.

The bug occurs because the original function is not handling the `sort` parameter appropriately. It is being passed into the `join` method but not correctly handled based on the warning message.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to properly handle the `sort` parameter. The function should check the value of the `sort` parameter and accordingly pass it to the `join` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if sort not in [True, False]:
        sort = None  # Set sort to None if it's not explicitly True or False

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
            )

        return joined
```

This corrected function properly handles the `sort` parameter and ensures it is accepted as `True`, `False`, or `None` (the default value). This should fix the bug related to the FutureWarning occurring in the test functions.
