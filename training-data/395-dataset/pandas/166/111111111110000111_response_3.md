The error occurs when running the test function `test_suppress_future_warning_with_sort_kw` with `sort_kw=True` or `sort_kw=False`. The error message indicates that an unexpected warning is being produced when running the test with the specified parameters.

The bug is likely to be located in the `_join_compat` method of the `DataFrame` class. This method is used within the `join` method which is being tested. The error message suggests that the warning related to sorting is not being suppressed despite passing `sort=True` or `sort=False` to the `join` method.

The bug occurs because the `_join_compat` method is not correctly handling the `sort` argument when using the `join` method. This causes the warning related to sorting to be produced even when `sort=True` is explicitly used.

To fix the bug, the `_join_compat` method should be modified to correctly handle the `sort` parameter and suppress any warnings related to sorting when `sort` is explicitly passed as `True` or `False`.

The corrected code for the `_join_compat` method is as follows:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort if sort is not None else False,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

In the corrected code, the `sort` parameter is properly handled and is only passed when it is explicitly provided. This should prevent the warning related to sorting from being produced when `sort=True` is explicitly used.
