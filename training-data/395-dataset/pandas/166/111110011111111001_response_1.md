The error message indicates that the `sort` parameter for the `join` function is not behaving as expected. The error is likely related to the implementation of the `_join_compat` function, which is used internally by the `join` method. The warning in the error message indicates that the behavior of sorting by default will change in a future version of pandas. This reflects a potential issue in the handling of the `sort` parameter.

The potential error location is within the `_join_compat` function where the `sort` parameter is being used to control the behavior of joining dataframes.

The issue is caused by the conditional logic in the `_join_compat` function, which is not handling the `sort` parameter correctly, leading to the unexpected behavior and warning messages in the test cases.

To fix this issue, the conditional logic for handling the `sort` parameter should be updated to ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected behavior described in the warning message.

Here are the possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional logic in the `_join_compat` function to handle the `sort` parameter correctly, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the warning message.
2. Use the information provided in the warning message to revise the handling of the `sort` parameter in the `_join_compat` function.

The corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
# ...
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    # Existing code for checking input types

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,  # use the 'sort' parameter directly
        )

    # Rest of the code
```

By directly passing the `sort` parameter to the `merge` function, the behavior will align with the expected sorting behavior, as indicated in the warning message and hence, resolves the issue.
