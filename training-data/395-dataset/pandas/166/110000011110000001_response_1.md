The error message indicates that there is an issue caused by unexpected warnings related to sorting. This indicates that the sort parameter in the join method is not functioning as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_join_compat` method. It seems that the sorting functionality is not being handled properly within this method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the sort parameter is not being handled correctly when using the `join` method, leading to unexpected future warnings related to sorting.

To fix the bug, the `_join_compat` method needs to handle the sort parameter properly when performing the join operation.

Below is the corrected code for the `_join_compat` method:

```python
def _join_compat(
        self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
    ):
        from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
        from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat
        
        if isinstance(other, Series):
            if other.name is None:
                raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
            other = DataFrame({other.name: other})
        
        if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
            return merge(
                self,
                other,
                left_on=on,
                how=how,
                left_index=on is None,
                right_index=True,
                suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
                sort=sort,
            )
        else:
            if on is not None:
                raise ValueError("Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index")
            
            frames = [self] + list(other)
            
            can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)
            
            # join indexes only using concat
            if can_concat:
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", sort=sort, verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                joined = frames[0]
                
                for frame in frames[1:]:
                    joined = merge(
                        joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
                    )
                
                return joined
```

In this corrected code, the `sort` parameter is being handled properly in both the `merge` and `concat` functions, enabling the sorting to be used as intended when performing the join operations.
