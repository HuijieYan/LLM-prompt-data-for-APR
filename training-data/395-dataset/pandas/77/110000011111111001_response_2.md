The analysis of the error message and the test case indicates that the issue lies within the `na_logical_op` function. The `operator.or_` function is used with two arrays `left` and `right`, which triggers a TypeError with the error message "unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'". This error occurs due to a mismatch in operand types when using the bitwise OR operator.

The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function is the line `result = op(x, y)`. This is where the bitwise OR operation is being performed.

The bug occurs because the `op` function is trying to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and a float. This happens because the `op` function is being called without explicitly checking for the types of `x` and `y`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `na_logical_op` function to explicitly check the types of `x` and `y` and handle the bitwise OR operation accordingly. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    if x.dtype.kind in {'i', 'b'} and y.dtype.kind in {'i', 'b'}:
        result = op(x, y)  # Perform bitwise OR operation
    else:
        # Handle the case where bitwise OR operation cannot be performed
        result = np.where(np.isnan(y), np.nan, x)  # Replace with NaN where necessary

    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- We explicitly check for the kinds of the dtypes of `x` and `y` to ensure that they are compatible for the bitwise OR operation.
- If the dtypes are compatible, we perform the bitwise OR using the `op` function. Otherwise, we handle the operation based on the specific conditions (in this case, replacing with NaN where necessary).
