The error occurs when the `na_logical_op` function is called within the `test_na_logical_op_2d` test case. The `na_logical_op` function is meant to handle logical operations on arrays containing NaN values, but it is currently encountering a TypeError related to unsupported operand types for the logical OR operation.

The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function is where the line `result = op(x, y)` is executed. This is the point where the logical operation is being performed, and the TypeError occurs because the logical OR operation is being applied to an 'int' and a 'float'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `op` function (in this case, `operator.or_`) is not handling the NaN values correctly when performing the logical operation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to implement a custom logical operation that can handle the presence of NaN values in the arrays. This would involve checking for NaN values and treating them according to the desired behavior for the logical operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import operator

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    result = np.empty(x.shape, dtype=object)
    for i in range(x.shape[0]):
        for j in range(x.shape[1]):
            if isinstance(x[i, j], (int, bool)) and isinstance(y[i, j], (int, bool)):
                result[i, j] = op(x[i, j], y[i, j])
            else:
                if np.isnan(x[i, j]) or np.isnan(y[i, j]):
                    result[i, j] = np.nan
                else:
                    result[i, j] = op(x[i, j], y[i, j])
    return result
```

This corrected function handles the logical operation `op` for arrays `x` and `y` containing NaN values. It iterates through the elements of the arrays and applies the logical operation while handling NaN values appropriately.
