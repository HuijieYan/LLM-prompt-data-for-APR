Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `result = op(x, y)` because the 'or_' operation cannot be directly applied to numpy arrays of different dtype (int64 and object).

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The function is trying to apply the logical operation 'or_' directly between two numpy arrays with different dtypes (int64 and object).
2. The function does not handle this specific case of mixed dtypes properly, resulting in a TypeError being caught.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the dtypes of x and y before applying the logical operation and handle the case where they are different.
2. Since the input arrays have different dtypes, consider using np.logical_or() instead of applying 'or_' directly.

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        # For exposition, write:
        #  yarr = isinstance(y, np.ndarray)
        #  yint = is_integer(y) or (yarr and y.dtype.kind == "i")
        #  ybool = is_bool(y) or (yarr and y.dtype.kind == "b")
        #  xint = x.dtype.kind == "i"
        #  xbool = x.dtype.kind == "b"
        # Then Cases where this goes through without raising include:
        #  (xint or xbool) and (yint or bool)
        if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and (isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and (y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'])):
            # both x and y are integer or boolean arrays
            result = op(x, y)
        else:
            # handle the case where dtypes are different
            result = np.logical_or(x.astype(bool), y.astype(bool))
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):

            assert not (is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype))
            x = ensure_object(x)
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)

            try:
