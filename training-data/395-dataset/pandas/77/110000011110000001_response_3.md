The test case involves testing the `na_logical_op` function with a 2D numpy array `left` and `right`. The `right` array has a `np.nan` value at position `[0, 0]`. The error message indicates a `TypeError` at line 273 of `array_ops.py`, specifically when trying to perform a bitwise or (`|`) operation between an integer and a float.

The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function seems to be the line `result = op(x, y)`. This line might be responsible for the erroneous handling of the bitwise or operation between `x` and `y`.

The bug occurs because the current implementation of `na_logical_op` does not handle the case where `y` contains a `np.nan` value correctly, resulting in a `TypeError` when attempting bitwise operations between an integer and a float.

One approach to fixing the bug could be to check for the presence of `np.nan` values in the `y` array before performing the bitwise operation. If `np.isnan(y).any()` returns `True`, the function could handle such cases separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if np.isnan(y).any():
        # Handle cases where y contains np.nan separately
        # For example, you could use np.where to replace np.nan values with 0 or 1
        y = np.where(np.isnan(y), 0, 1)
        return op(x, y)
    else:
        try:
            result = op(x, y)
        except TypeError:
            if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
                assert not (is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype))
                x = ensure_object(x)
                y = ensure_object(y)
                result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
            else:
                assert lib.is_scalar(y)
                if not isna(y):
                    y = bool(y)
                try:
                    result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
                except (
                    TypeError,
                    ValueError,
                    AttributeError,
                    OverflowError,
                    NotImplementedError,
                ):
                    typ = type(y).__name__
                    raise TypeError(
                        f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                        f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                    )

        return result
```

In the corrected code, a check for the presence of `np.nan` values in the `y` array is added. If any `np.nan` values are found, they are handled separately. Otherwise, the function tries to perform the specified operation.
