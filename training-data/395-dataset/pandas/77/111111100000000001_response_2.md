Potential Error location: The potential error is in the try block where the function attempts to perform the operation `op(x, y)`.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The bug may occur due to invalid inputs or incorrect implementation of the logical operation.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type and validity of the inputs `x` and `y` before performing the logical operation.
2. Handle different data types and scenarios in a more robust manner to avoid the TypeError exception.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        if is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype):
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Invalid types for logical operation")
    else:
        if lib.is_scalar(y) and not isna(y):
            y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )
        else:
            raise TypeError("Invalid type for scalar operation")

    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- We check the type of `y` to differentiate between array operations and scalar operations.
- We also handle different data types and scenarios in a more structured and clear manner.
- Proper error messages are raised for invalid types and scenarios.
