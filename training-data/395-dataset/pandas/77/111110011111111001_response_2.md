The error message indicates that the `or_` operator is being applied to an integer and a float, which isn't supported. This suggests that the `op` parameter is being passed as the `or_` operator (i.e., `operator.or_`) and is failing to handle the operation between an array of integers and an array of floats.

The potential error location within the function is the line `result = op(x, y)` where the `op` function is being applied to the input arrays `x` and `y`.

The bug occurs because the `op` function is not handling the operation between an array of integers and an array of floats. This could be due to the fact that the function is not directly checking for the data types of the input arrays and their compatibility with the provided operation.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly handle the data types and their compatibility for the provided operation. We can check the data types of the input arrays and apply the `op` function only if the data types are compatible for the specified operation.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    x_dtype = x.dtype
    y_dtype = y.dtype if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) else type(y)
    
    if x_dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and (y_dtype.kind in ['i', 'b', 'f']):
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            assert not (x_dtype.kind == 'b' and y_dtype.kind == 'b')
            x = np.asarray(x, dtype=object)
            y = np.asarray(y, dtype=object)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert np.isscalar(y)
            if not pd.isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError, OverflowError, NotImplementedError):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x_dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check the data types of the input arrays `x` and `y` to ensure compatibility with the provided operation `op`. If the data types are compatible, we apply the `op` function; otherwise, we handle the operation based on the data types and scalar or array status of `y`.
