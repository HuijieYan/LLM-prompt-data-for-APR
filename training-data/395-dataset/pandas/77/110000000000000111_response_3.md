Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is the result variable where the operation op is being performed. 

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the code attempts to perform the operation op() on the x and y inputs without properly handling all data types and potential exceptions.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can handle different data types and exceptions more explicitly, and use appropriate checks before performing the operation op().

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

# Corrected function
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            x = x.astype('O')
            y = y.astype('O')
            result = np.vectorize(op)(x, y)
        else:
            try:
                y = bool(y)
                result = op(x, y)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )
    return result
```
