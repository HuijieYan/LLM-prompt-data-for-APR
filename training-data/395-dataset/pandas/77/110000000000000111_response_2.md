Potential error location: 

The potential error location in the problematic function is the way it handles different data types for the input variables x and y. The code currently uses isinstance() and dtype.kind to determine the types of the variables x and y.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The buggy function is not handling different data types properly, resulting in the TypeError exception being raised when the operation is performed. This occurs due to the incorrect handling of different data types for the input variables x and y.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use the np.isinteger() and np.isbool() functions to check if y is an integer or a boolean value, respectively.
2. Use the np.isscalar() function to check if y is a scalar value.
3. Handle the different data types for x and y by explicitly checking their types and then performing the operation accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            assert not (np.isbool(x.dtype) and np.isbool(y.dtype))
            x = np.asarray(x, dtype=object)
            y = np.asarray(y, dtype=object)
            result = x + y  # perform the desired operation for ndarray inputs
        else:
            if not np.isscalar(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = x + y  # perform the desired operation for scalar inputs
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```
