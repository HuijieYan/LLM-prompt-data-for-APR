Potential error location: The potential error in the given function is in the try-except block where it attempts to perform the operation "op(x, y)". The error handling in the except block also seems to be incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function tries to perform the operation "op(x, y)" without properly handling the types of x and y. It also incorrectly handles the exception cases.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the types of x and y before performing the operation to ensure they are compatible for the operation.
2. Improve the error handling in the except block to handle different exception types appropriately.
3. Use numpy's built-in functions to handle array operations and their compatibility.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        try:
            result = op(x, y)
        except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError, OverflowError, NotImplementedError) as e:
            typ = type(y).__name__
            raise TypeError(
                f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
            )
    return result
```
