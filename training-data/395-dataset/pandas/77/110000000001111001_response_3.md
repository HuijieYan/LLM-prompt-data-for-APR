The buggy function `na_logical_op` is intended to perform a logical operation on two numpy arrays x and y using the operation 'op'. The function first attempts to perform the operation using the input 'op' and returns the result. However, if a TypeError is encountered during the operation, it handles the error differently for numpy arrays and scalar values.

In the provided test case, the input numpy arrays x and y have different data types, with x being of type 'int64' and y being of type 'O' (object). The operation 'or_' is being applied to these arrays, resulting in a ValueError due to the incompatible data types.

The bug arises from the mismatch of data types between the input arrays x and y, which causes the ValueError when attempting the logical operation.

To fix this bug, the function should first check whether the data types of the input arrays x and y are compatible for the specified logical operation. If they are not compatible, appropriate error handling should be employed to handle such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the function `na_logical_op`:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and (isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b']):
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        try:
            result = op(x, y)
        except (
            TypeError,
            ValueError,
            AttributeError,
            OverflowError,
            NotImplementedError,
        ):
            typ = type(y).__name__
            raise TypeError(
                f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
            )
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the data types of the input arrays x and y are compatible for the specified logical operation. If they are compatible, we directly perform the operation. Otherwise, we handle the error using a try-except block as before. Additionally, we have removed unnecessary assertions and added more explicit error messages to provide better information about the error.
