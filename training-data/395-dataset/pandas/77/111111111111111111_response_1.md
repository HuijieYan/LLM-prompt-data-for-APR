The error occurs in the `na_logical_op` function when it tries to execute the operation `op(x, y)` which results in a TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'. This indicates that the function is trying to perform a logical OR operation between an integer and a float, which is not supported.

The bug is likely to be related to the conditionals in the function that handle different data types and operations. It seems that the function is not properly distinguishing between the different data types and is attempting to perform unsupported operations.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case where the data types are not compatible for the logical operation. It can check the data types of the inputs and handle integer, boolean, and object types differently to ensure the operations are carried out correctly.

In addition, for the test case, the expected result is to perform a logical OR operation between `left` and `right`, resulting in `right` since the first element of `right` is nan. The corrected function should ensure that this logical operation is correctly handled without raising any errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype.kind in ("i", "b") and y.dtype.kind in ("i", "b"):
        # For integers and booleans, convert to objects to perform operations
        x = x.astype(object)
        y = y.astype(object)
        result = op(x, y)
    elif y.dtype.kind == "O":
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported operand types: {x.dtype} and {y.dtype}")

    return result
```
