The buggy function is designed to handle logical operations on numpy arrays. However, the error arises from the use of the `op` parameter, which is a built-in function or method. The function attempts to apply this function directly to the numpy arrays x and y, leading to the error.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle different types of operations separately, and remove the direct use of the `op` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if op.__name__ == 'or_':
        result = np.logical_or(x, y)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported logical operation")

    return result
```

This corrected function directly applies the logical `or` operation using `np.logical_or()` based on the `op.__name__` value. This approach helps to avoid the TypeError that was encountered in the original function.
