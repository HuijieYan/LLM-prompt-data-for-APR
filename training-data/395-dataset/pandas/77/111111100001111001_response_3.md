The potential error in the code is likely occurring in the `try` block, specifically in the line `result = op(x, y)`. 

The bug occurs when trying to perform a logical operation (in this case, a bitwise OR) between arrays `x` and `y`. The function is not handling the `y` array with NaN values properly, as it has a dtype of 'object', and this is leading to unexpected results.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the NaN values properly and ensure that the logical operation is performed correctly between the arrays `x` and `y`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and y.dtype.kind == 'O':
        y = np.where(np.isnan(y), False, True)  # convert NaN values to False
    result = op(x, y)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we use `numpy.isnan()` to check for NaN values in the `y` array and then use `numpy.where()` to convert the NaN values to False. This ensures that the array `y` is properly handled before performing the logical operation.
