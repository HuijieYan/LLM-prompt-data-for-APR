Potential error location: The try-except block is catching a TypeError, but it's not clear why it's being caught, and the code within the except block doesn't seem to handle the error properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The code within the try block doesn't handle all the potential cases that could raise a TypeError.
- The code within the except block is not properly handling the error and doesn't provide a clear path for what to do when a TypeError is caught.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Add explicit checks for the different data types and handle each case separately to avoid TypeError.
- Update the except block to properly handle the TypeError and provide a clear path for what to do when it's caught.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if not isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        y = np.array([y])
        
    if x.dtype.kind in ["i", "b"] and y.dtype.kind in ["i", "b"]:
        result = op(x, y)
    elif np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.bool_) and np.issubdtype(y.dtype, np.bool_):
        result = op(x, y)
    elif np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.object) or np.issubdtype(y.dtype, np.object):
        x = x.astype(np.object)
        y = y.astype(np.object)
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        typ = type(y).__name__ if np.isscalar(y) else y.dtype.type.__name__
        raise TypeError(
            f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
            f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
        )

    return result
```
