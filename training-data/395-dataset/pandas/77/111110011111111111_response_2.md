The error occurs in the `na_logical_op` function when the `op` function is called with the `x` and `y` arrays as arguments. The error message indicates a "TypeError" because of unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'. This error occurs because the `op` function called is the bitwise or operation which is not compatible with 'int' and 'float' types.

The potential error location within the function is the line:

```python
result = op(x, y)
```

The buggy function is not handling the operation between an array of integers and an array of objects properly, which leads to the error.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the case where the operation is performed between an array of integers and an array of objects. One approach to fix this would be to explicitly check the dtype of the arrays and handle the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and (y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] or y.dtype.kind == 'O'):
            result = np.logical_or(x, y)
        else:
            x = x.astype('object')
            y = y.astype('object')
            result = np.vectorize(op)(x, y)
    else:
        # Handle the case when y is a scalar
        y = bool(y) if not np.isnan(y) else np.nan
        result = np.vectorize(op)(x, y)

    return result
```

This corrected function checks the dtype of the arrays `x` and `y`, and handles the operation accordingly. If `y` is an ndarray and the dtypes of `x` and `y` satisfy the conditions for bitwise or function, it uses the `np.logical_or` function; otherwise, it converts both arrays to objects and uses `np.vectorize` to perform the operation. If `y` is a scalar, it handles the operation accordingly.
