Potential error location: In the `try` block of the `na_logical_op` function, the error occurs when `op(x, y)` is called with the `or_` operator.

Reasons for bug: The bug occurs because the `or_` operator is not supported for the given data types. It seems like the code is trying to perform a bitwise OR operation between integer and floating-point values, which is not valid.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data types of `x` and `y` and handle them appropriately based on their types.
2. Use the `numpy.logical_or` function to perform element-wise logical OR operation for arrays when dealing with boolean arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` method:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            if np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.integer) and np.issubdtype(y.dtype, np.floating):
                x = x.astype(float)
            elif np.issubdtype(y.dtype, np.integer) and np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.floating):
                y = y.astype(float)
            elif np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.bool_) and np.issubdtype(y.dtype, np.bool_):
                result = np.logical_or(x, y)
                return result
            else:
                assert not (np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.bool_) and np.issubdtype(y.dtype, np.bool_))
                x = x.astype(object)
                y = y.astype(object)
                result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not pd.isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )
    return result
```

In the updated code, we have added handling for different data types and used `np.logical_or` for boolean arrays when the `or_` operator is used. We've also handled the conversion of integer to floating-point numbers if necessary.
