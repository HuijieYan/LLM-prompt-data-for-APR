The error message indicates a TypeError when trying to perform a logical OR operation on an 'int' and 'float' type. The error occurs when using the operator.or_ function within the test function. This propagates to the na_logical_op function, leading to a ValueError when trying to perform a binary operation using the vec_binop function.

The potential error location within the na_logical_op function is the line `result = op(x, y)` where the logical operation is being performed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logical operation is being performed directly without considering the data types and dimensions of the input arrays.

To fix the bug, we need to check the data types and dimensions of the input arrays before performing the logical operation. If the dimensions are satisfied, we should convert the arrays to the same data type before performing the operation.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b']:
        # Convert arrays to a common data type
        dtype = np.find_common_type([x.dtype, y.dtype], [])
        x = x.astype(dtype)
        y = y.astype(dtype)
    elif x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and not y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b']:
        # Convert y to the data type of x
        y = y.astype(x.dtype)
    elif not x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b']:
        # Convert x to the data type of y
        x = x.astype(y.dtype)

    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except ValueError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            x = ensure_object(x)
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we first check the data types and dimensions of the input arrays and then perform the logical operation after adjusting the arrays to a common data type if necessary.
