The potential error location in the code is where the result is calculated using the 'op' function with inputs 'x' and 'y'. It seems that the 'op' function is not handling the inputs 'x' and 'y' properly, leading to a TypeError.

The bug is likely occurring because the 'op' function is not able to handle the input types 'int64' and 'O' (Object) for 'x' and 'y.dtype' respectively. This is causing a TypeError when trying to perform the operation.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the specific case where the 'op' function is not able to handle the given input types. This can be done by explicitly checking for the case of 'x' and 'y' with integer and object dtypes, and performing the operation accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    # Check if 'op' can handle the input types
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and (x.dtype.kind in ["i", "b"]) and y.dtype.kind in ["i", "b"]:
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        # Handle the case where 'op' cannot handle the input types
        x = ensure_object(x)
        y = ensure_object(y)
        result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check if 'op' can handle the input types by examining the dtype of 'x' and 'y'. If 'op' can't handle the input types, we convert 'x' and 'y' to object dtypes and perform the operation using 'libops.vec_binop'. This approach ensures that the operation is carried out properly, regardless of the input types.
