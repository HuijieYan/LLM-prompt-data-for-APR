Potential error location: The potential error location is in the try-except block where the function attempts to perform the operation `op(x, y)`. 

Reason behind the bug: The function does not handle all possible data types and operations correctly, leading to potential TypeErrors or ValueErrors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type of `x` and `y` to make sure they are compatible for the operation.
2. Handle the different data types and operations separately to ensure that the function can handle a wider range of input types.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            x = x.astype(object)
            y = y.astype(object)
            result = op(x, y)
        else:
            y = np.bool_(y) if not np.isnan(y) else np.nan
            result = op(x, y)
    return result
```
