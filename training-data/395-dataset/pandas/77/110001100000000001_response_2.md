Potential error location: The code is trying to perform a logical operation on arrays x and y, but it is not handling the different data types and operations correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
- The function is not properly handling data types and operations for x and y, leading to potential TypeErrors or ValueErrors.
- Additionally, there are assertions and try-except blocks that do not cover all possible scenarios, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Handle different data types and operations for x and y properly, considering all possible scenarios.
- Remove or rewrite the assertions and try-except blocks to cover all possible scenarios and handle the errors more effectively.
- Ensure that the function provides explicit error messages for easier debugging.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError, OverflowError, NotImplementedError):
        raise TypeError(
            f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with arrays of dtyped [{x.dtype}] and [{y.dtype}]"
        )

    return result
```
