The bug in the function arises from the use of the `op` function without checking if it is a valid operation for the given input types. The function then attempts to perform the operation without handling the specific types of `x` and `y`.

To fix this bug, the function should check the types of `x` and `y` and handle the operation accordingly. Additionally, it should also handle the case when `y` contains NaN values.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if op.__name__ in ['or_', 'and_']:
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        result = np.logical_or(x, y)
    
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `op` is either `or_` or `and_` using `op.__name__` and perform the operation directly if it is. Otherwise, we use `np.logical_or` to perform the logical operation between `x` and `y`. This ensures that the function handles the different types of operations and input arrays correctly.
