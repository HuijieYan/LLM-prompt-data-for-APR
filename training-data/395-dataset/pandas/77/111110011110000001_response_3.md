The error occurs when the `na_logical_op` function is called with `left`, `right`, and `operator.or_` as arguments. The function then tries to apply the logical OR operator using the `or_` function from the `operator` module, and it fails with a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types for the bitwise OR: 'int' and 'float'.

The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function is in the `try` block, where it attempts to apply the operator `op` to the input arrays `x` and `y`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when the input arrays have different data types properly, resulting in the unsupported operand types error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `na_logical_op` function to handle the case when the input arrays have different data types. We can do this by checking the data types of `x` and `y`, and if they are different, we can convert both arrays to a common data type before applying the operator `op` to them.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            x = x.astype(y.dtype)
            y = y.astype(x.dtype)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

With this modification, the `na_logical_op` function will handle the case when the input arrays have different data types by converting them to a common data type before applying the operator. This should prevent the unsupported operand type error from occurring.
