The bug in the `na_logical_op` function seems to be occurring when performing the operation `op(x, y)` with the given inputs. The inputs are arrays `x` and `y` of types `ndarray` with different data types (`int64` and `object`, respectively), and the operation `op` is of type `builtin_function_or_method`. The function is designed to handle various types of inputs and perform the operation, but it seems to be failing in this case.

The reason for the bug could be the mismatch in data types of the input arrays `x` and `y`, and the operation `op`. The function seems to be checking for specific data types and handling operations accordingly, but it may not be able to handle these specific input types, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the function should handle operations between arrays with different data types more robustly. One approach could be to convert the data type of one of the arrays to match the other before performing the operation. In this case, converting the data type of array `x` to match the data type of array `y` before performing the operation might resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function after handling the data type conversion:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype != y.dtype:
        x = x.astype(y.dtype)
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
        return result
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        return None
```

In this corrected code, before performing the operation, the function checks if the data types of `x` and `y` are different. If they are, it converts the data type of `x` to match the data type of `y`. Then, it attempts to perform the operation and returns the result. If an error occurs, it catches the exception and returns `None`.
