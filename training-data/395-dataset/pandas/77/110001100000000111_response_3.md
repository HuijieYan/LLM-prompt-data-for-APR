The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of different data types for the input arrays x and y. The function attempts to perform an operation on x and y without properly handling the cases where the data types are not compatible.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not explicitly check for the data types of x and y before attempting the operation. This can lead to TypeErrors or ValueErrors when trying to perform operations between arrays of different types.

To fix the bug, it is important to first check the data types of both x and y before attempting the operation. This can be done using the `dtype` attribute of numpy arrays or by using conditional statements to check for data type compatibility.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    x_dtype = x.dtype.kind
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        y_dtype = y.dtype.kind
    else:
        y_dtype = np.array(y).dtype.kind
    
    if (x_dtype in ['i', 'b'] or np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.integer) or np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.bool_)) and (y_dtype in ['i', 'b'] or np.issubdtype(y_dtype, np.integer) or np.issubdtype(y_dtype, np.bool_)):
        # perform the operation
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        # handle incompatible types
        raise TypeError(f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with arrays of types [{x_dtype}] and [{y_dtype}]")

    return result
```

This corrected code checks the data types of both x and y before attempting the operation. If the data types are compatible (integers or booleans), it performs the operation. If the data types are not compatible, it raises a TypeError with an informative message.
