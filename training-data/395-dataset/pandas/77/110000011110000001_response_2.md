The error message indicates that the issue is with the logical OR operation (`|`). It seems that the function `na_logical_op` is not handling the logical OR operation correctly when dealing with arrays with NaN (Not a Number) values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logical OR operation happening in the `try` block: `result = op(x, y)`. It seems that this operation is not handling NaN values properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logical OR operation (`|`) is not correctly handling arrays with NaN values.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `try` block to handle NaN values specifically when it encounters arrays with NaN values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = np.logical_or(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            # bool-bool dtype operations should be OK, should not get here
            assert not (is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype))
            x = ensure_object(x)
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            # let null fall thru
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

This corrected function now directly uses the `np.logical_or` function to handle the logical OR operation. This should handle NaN values correctly and avoid the error encountered in the test case.
