The potential error location within the problematic function is with the line `result = op(x, y)`. The bug occurs because the `op` variable is a built-in function or method, and it is not handling the operation between arrays containing NaN values correctly.

The bug occurs because the `op` function is not handling the NaN values in the arrays x and y correctly. When using the logical OR function (`or_`) with arrays containing NaN values, it should return an array where the result is `True` if either of the elements being compared is `True`, and `False` if both elements are `False` or `NaN`. However, in the buggy implementation, it seems to be not handling the NaN values properly, which leads to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we can use the np.logical_or function instead of the `op` function. This function is specifically designed to handle logical OR operations between arrays, including cases where the arrays contain NaN values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = np.logical_or(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            assert not (is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype))
            x = ensure_object(x)
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```
