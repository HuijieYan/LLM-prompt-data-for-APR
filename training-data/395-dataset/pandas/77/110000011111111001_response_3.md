Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `na_logical_op` function at the line `result = op(x, y)` where it is trying to perform a logical OR operation between the `x` and `y` arrays using the given `op` argument.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is occurring because numpy's logical OR operation (`np.logical_or`) is being used with two arrays `x` and `y` where the array `y` contains elements with `nan` (not a number) and their dtype is `object`. Numpy is trying to perform an element-wise logical OR operation between an integer and a float, resulting in the TypeError: "unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'."

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we can modify the `na_logical_op` function to handle the case where the `y` array contains `nan` values with dtype `object` by falling back to a different approach to perform the logical OR operation.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    if y.dtype == np.object and np.isnan(y).any():
        mask = np.isnan(y)
        result = np.where(mask, True, op(x, y))
    else:
        result = op(x, y)
    return result
```
In the corrected `na_logical_op` function, we first check if the `y` array has `nan` values with dtype `object`. If it does, we create a mask for the `nan` values and use `np.where` to replace the `nan` values with `True` and perform the logical OR operation. If there are no `nan` values, we simply perform the logical OR operation using the given `op`.
