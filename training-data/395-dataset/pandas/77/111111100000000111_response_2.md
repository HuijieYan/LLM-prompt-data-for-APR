Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the lines that check for the data types of x and y and the subsequent logical operation performed using the 'op' function.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The buggy function 'na_logical_op' has a complex set of conditions for different data types of x and y. This complexity can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors when performing logical operations.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Simplify the set of conditions for different data types of x and y.
2. Ensure that the logical operation performed using the 'op' function is appropriate for the specific data types of x and y.
3. Handle exceptions and errors in a clearer and more structured manner.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        # Performing operation on two arrays
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        # Performing operation on an array and a scalar
        try:
            result = op(x, y)
        except (
            TypeError,
            ValueError,
            AttributeError,
            OverflowError,
            NotImplementedError,
        ):
            typ = type(y).__name__
            raise TypeError(
                f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
            )
    return result
```
