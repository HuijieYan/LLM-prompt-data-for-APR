The provided function na_logical_op is intended to perform a logical operation between two arrays x and y using the given op. The function tries to carry out the operation with the provided op, but if it encounters a TypeError, it tries to handle the error by converting the input array x to an object and attempting the operation again.

In the buggy case 1, the input arrays x and y have different dtypes - x has a dtype of int64, while y has a dtype of object. The op is 'or_', which is a built-in function or method. This combination leads to the function throwing a TypeError and attempting to handle it by converting the input array x to an object.

The potential error location is at the point of executing the op(x, y) operation, as it cannot handle the combination of int64 and object dtypes for the input arrays x and y.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the dtypes of both input arrays x and y are valid for the intended logical operation. If they are not valid, we can convert both input arrays to object dtypes and then perform the operation. This will ensure that the logical operation can be executed successfully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype.kind not in ['i', 'b'] or (isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and y.dtype.kind not in ['i', 'b']):
        x = x.astype(object)
        y = y.astype(object)
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        x = x.astype(object)
        y = y.astype(object)
        result = op(x, y) 
    return result
```
