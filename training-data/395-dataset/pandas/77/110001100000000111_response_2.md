Potential error: The function na_logical_op() is intended to perform a logical operation on two numpy arrays x and y using the specified operator op. However, there seem to be issues with type checking and error handling within the function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The function uses type checking and error handling using try-except blocks, but the handling seems inconsistent and confusing.
2. There are multiple if-else conditions to handle different data types and scenarios, leading to potential confusion and errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the error handling and type checking logic to make it more intuitive and maintainable.
2. Use numpy's built-in functions for type checking and handling logical operations to reduce complexity and potential errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    if not isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        y = np.array(y)
    result = op(x, y)
    return result
```
