The test case `test_na_logical_op_2d` is trying to test the `na_logical_op` function using the `or_` operator. The `left` array contains integers, and the `right` array contains an `np.nan` value as the first element. The expected behavior is to fall back to the `vec_binop` branch due to the presence of the `np.nan` value.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` stating "unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'". This is followed by a `ValueError` that says "Buffer has the wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)".

The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function is the `result = op(x, y)` line. This is where the operation is performed, and it seems to be causing the type error.

The bug occurred because when the `op` function is applied to `x` and `y`, the types of the elements in the arrays are not handled properly. The presence of `np.nan` in the `right` array caused the function to encounter a float value, which conflicted with the integer values in the `left` array.

To fix the bug, conditional checks should be added to handle the presence of different data types in `x` and `y`. Specifically, when using the `or_` operator, the presence of `np.nan` in the `right` array should be properly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if np.isnan(y).any():
        result = np.logical_or(x, np.isnan(y))
    else:
        result = op(x, y)
    return result
```
