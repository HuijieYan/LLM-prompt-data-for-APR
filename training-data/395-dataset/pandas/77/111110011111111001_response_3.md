The error occurs when the `operator.or_` function is called with the `left` and `right` arrays. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the `or_` function in the `na_logical_op` function. The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type for the bitwise OR (`|`) operation, specifically between an 'int' and a 'float'.

The issue lies in the `na_logical_op` function's handling of different types when performing logical operations. It tries to directly apply the provided `op` function to the arrays `x` and `y`, which can lead to type mismatches and unsupported operations.

Possible approaches to fix this bug include:
1. Checking the types of `x` and `y` before applying the `op` function to ensure that the operation is supported.
2. Handling the case when the types of `x` and `y` are not directly compatible with the chosen operation, such as converting one type to another if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and (isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and (y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'])):
        # Perform logical operations for integer or boolean arrays
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        # Convert y to a boolean array if it's not already
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            y = np.isnan(y)  # Convert to boolean array with True where y is nan, False otherwise
        else:
            y = bool(y)  # Convert scalar y to boolean

        # Perform logical operations between x and y
        result = op(x.astype(bool), y)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the types of `x` and `y` are compatible with the chosen operation. If not, we handle the mismatched types by converting `y` to a boolean array and then applying the `op` function to `x` and the modified `y`.
