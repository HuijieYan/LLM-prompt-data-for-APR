The error is occurring because the `Series.rename` function is not correctly handling custom indexers that are passed as input. When a custom indexer is passed, the function attempts to call it as a function when it should treat it as a scalar or list-like input.

The bug is likely located in the section of the code that checks if the index is a mapping. It incorrectly treats custom indexers as non-mapping types and tries to call them as functions, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to explicitly check if the input index is callable or is a mapping, and then handle it accordingly. If the index is callable or a mapping, it should be passed to `super().rename`, otherwise, it should be treated the same way as a scalar or list-like input.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this modification, the `Series.rename` function should now handle custom indexers correctly and resolve the error that was occurring.
