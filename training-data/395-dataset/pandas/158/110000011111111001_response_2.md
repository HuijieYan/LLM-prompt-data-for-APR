The bug seems to be in the `rename` method of the Series class, particularly in the part where it checks if `index` is non-mapping. The error message indicates that the method is trying to iterate over the `MyIndexer` object, which is not iterable, causing a TypeError.

The reason behind this bug is that the method is not properly handling the `index` parameter when it is not a mapping (i.e., a scalar, hashable sequence, or function). The `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions are not properly checking if `index` is a scalar or a list-like object, leading to the TypeError when trying to iterate over it.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition for checking if `index` is non-mapping and handle the non-mapping case properly. We can check if `index` is callable (a function) and if it is not a collection (scalar), then we can proceed to change the `Series.name` attribute using the `_set_name` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
    
    if callable(index) or not is_collection(index):
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
    return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
```

By using the `callable` and `is_collection` checks, we can appropriately handle the non-mapping case and avoid the TypeError when trying to iterate over non-iterable objects.

This should resolve the issue and allow the `rename` method to handle non-mapping index values without raising a TypeError.
