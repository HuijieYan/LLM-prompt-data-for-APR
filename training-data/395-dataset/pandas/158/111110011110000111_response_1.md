The provided code defines a class `Series` which contains a method `rename`. When tested with the `test_rename_with_custom_indexer` and `test_rename_with_custom_indexer_inplace` functions, both tests raise a TypeError - 'MyIndexer' object is not iterable.

The issue occurs in the `rename` method of the `Series` class when it encounters a custom indexer (`MyIndexer` class) that is not iterable. This error occurs because the `rename` method incorrectly assumes that anything that isn't a scalar or list-like is a mapping.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement in the `rename` method to properly handle custom indexers that are not iterable. A possible approach is to check if the index is callable (i.e., a function) or if it is dict-like. If so, we should call the superclass `rename` method. Otherwise, we can treat the index as a scalar or list-like and call the `_set_name` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.

    (... rest of the docstring ...)

    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this modification, the `rename` method of the `Series` class should now handle custom indexers (such as the `MyIndexer` class) correctly and avoid the TypeError.

After making this change, the provided test functions should run without raising any errors.
