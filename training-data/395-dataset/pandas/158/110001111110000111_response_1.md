The error message indicates that the 'MyIndexer' object is not iterable, which means that the 'rename' method cannot handle the 'MyIndexer' class as an input.

The potential error location within the 'rename' method is the conditional statement that checks whether the index is non-mapping. The current implementation checks if the index is a scalar or list-like, and if so, it calls the '_set_name' method. Otherwise, it calls the 'super().rename' method.

The bug occurs because the 'rename' method cannot handle custom objects like 'MyIndexer' that are not iterable.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement should be updated to check if the index is callable or is a dict-like object. If it is callable or dict-like, it should call the 'super().rename' method. Otherwise, it should call the '_set_name' method.

Here's the corrected code for the 'rename' method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
    
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this correction, the 'rename' method can handle custom objects like 'MyIndexer' without raising an error.
