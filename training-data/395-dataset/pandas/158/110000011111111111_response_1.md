The issue arises from the `rename` method in the `Series` class of pandas. The problem occurs when the `rename` method is called with a non-mapping index, such as a custom class, which leads to a TypeError.

The potential error location is within the logic for handling non-mapping index in the `rename` method. The current implementation uses the `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions to determine if the index is non-mapping, and then calls the `_set_name` method to handle the renaming. However, this logic is not handling non-mapping index appropriately, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional logic in the `rename` method to check if the index is callable or dict-like, and if not, treat it the same way as a scalar or list-like.

Here is the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    
    ... (rest of the docstring)

    """
    
    index_is_callable = callable(index)  # Check if the index is callable
    index_is_dict_like = is_dict_like(index)  # Check if the index is dict-like
    
    if index_is_callable or index_is_dict_like:
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

By checking if the index is callable or dict-like, and then handling it accordingly, we ensure that non-mapping indices, such as custom classes, are handled correctly without raising a TypeError.
