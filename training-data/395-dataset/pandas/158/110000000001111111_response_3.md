Potential error location:
The issue in the code lies in the logic used to determine if the index is non-mapping. The current condition to check if the index is non-mapping is not accurate and leads to incorrect handling of the index.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to check for non-mapping in the index is not correctly identifying non-mapping values, leading to an incorrect call to the `_set_name` method.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the condition to check for non-mapping should be adjusted. Instead of checking for scalar or list-like values, the code can be modified to check if the index is callable or dict-like. If the index is neither callable nor dict-like, it should be treated the same way as a scalar or list-like.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```
