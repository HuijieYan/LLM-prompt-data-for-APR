The error is occurring when calling the `rename` method on a Series object with an object that is not a scalar or list-like, such as the `MyIndexer` class in the test case.

The issue is caused by the logic in the `rename` method that checks for non-mapping objects. If the object is not a scalar or list-like, it tries to call the `_set_name` method instead of using the inherited `rename` method.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `rename` method needs to be adjusted to properly handle non-mapping objects. Instead of checking for non-mapping objects, it should directly check if the object is callable or a mapping (like a dictionary).

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```
The updated logic directly checks if the `index` object is callable or a mapping using the `is_dict_like` function. If it is, it calls the inherited `rename` method. Otherwise, it sets the `inplace` parameter and calls the `_set_name` method.

This change ensures that the `rename` method properly handles non-mapping objects and resolves the error in the test cases.
