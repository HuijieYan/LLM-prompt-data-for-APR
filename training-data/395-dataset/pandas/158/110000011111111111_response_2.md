The issue is with the `rename` method, where it fails when a custom class object is provided as the `index` argument. The bug occurs because the `rename` method checks if the `index` is a mapping using an incorrect condition. As a result, it incorrectly tries to set the name based on the `index` object.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the condition in the `rename` method to check if the `index` is callable or a mapping.
2. If the `index` is callable or a mapping, use the `super().rename` method as before.
3. If the `index` is not callable or a mapping, set the name using the `_set_name` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.

    ...

    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    # Check if index is callable or a mapping
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With these changes, the `rename` method should now handle custom class objects correctly and set the name based on the provided index.
