The issue occurs because the `Series.rename` function does not correctly handle non-mapping objects, such as instances of custom classes, which can be accepted as index labels by the `Series` constructor. 

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of non-mapping objects. The code in the `Series.rename` function checks if the `index` parameter is a scalar or list-like, and if not, it calls the `_set_name` method instead of the correct behavior. This leads to errors when non-mapping objects are passed as the `index` parameter to the `Series.rename` function.

To fix the bug, the code in the `Series.rename` function needs to be modified to properly handle non-mapping objects as valid input. The condition checking for non-mapping objects should be revised to correctly identify callable objects and treat them as valid input. 

Modifying the code as follows will resolve the bug:

```python
if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
    return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
else:
    return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

This revised code checks if the `index` parameter is callable or a mapping (dict-like) object, and if so, it calls the `super().rename` method. Otherwise, it falls back to calling the `_set_name` method to handle non-mapping objects correctly.

With this change, the `Series.rename` function will be able to handle a wider range of input types, including custom class instances, without raising errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `Series.rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```
