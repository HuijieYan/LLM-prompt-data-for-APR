The issue is related to the `rename` method for the `Series` class in pandas. The problem occurs when trying to rename a Series using an object that is not callable, such as the `MyIndexer` class in the given test case.

The potential error location within the `rename` method is in the section that checks if the `index` parameter is a mapping or not. The code currently assumes that anything that isn't a scalar or list-like is a mapping, which is incorrect and causes the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code incorrectly assumes that non-mapping types should be treated as scalars or list-like, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to rename the Series using the non-callable object.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be used:
- Update the code to explicitly check if the `index` parameter is callable or a mapping, and if not, treat it the same way as a scalar or list-like object.

Here's the corrected `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ...
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this corrected code, the `rename` method will correctly handle non-callable and non-mapping types, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
