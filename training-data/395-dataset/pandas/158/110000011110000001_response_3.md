The error message indicates that the 'rename' method is trying to iterate over the input parameter 'ix' which is of type MyIndexer. This is not iterable, leading to a TypeError.

The bug is located in the 'rename' method where it is not handling the case when 'index' is not a mapping type. It is assuming that 'index' will be a mapping type (like a dict), and if it's not, it tries to use it as a new name for the Series, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this, we should check if 'index' is a mapping type, and if not, treat it as a new name for the Series. The corrected code for the 'rename' function is as follows:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    non_mapping = is_scalar(index) or (
        is_list_like(index) and not is_dict_like(index)
    )
    if non_mapping:
        if "inplace" in kwargs and kwargs["inplace"]:
            self.name = index
            return None
        else:
            return self.copy(name=index)
    return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We first check if 'index' is a mapping type or not using the 'non_mapping' variable.
2. If 'index' is not a mapping type, we handle it accordingly:
   - If 'inplace' is True, we directly set the Series name to 'index' and return None.
   - If 'inplace' is False or not provided, we create a copy of the Series with the new name and return it.
