The error occurs when calling the `rename` method with an object that is not callable. The `rename` method currently handles anything that isn't a scalar or list-like as a mapping, but it should also handle cases where the object is not callable.

The reason for the bug is that the method is not correctly handling cases where the object passed to `rename` is not a dictionary or callable.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statement in the `rename` method to also consider objects that are callable.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
    
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this change, the `rename` method will correctly handle cases where the object passed to it is not a dictionary or callable.
