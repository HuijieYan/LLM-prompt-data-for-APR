The function `rename` in the `Series` class is designed to handle anything that isn't a scalar or list-like as a mapping, which is causing an issue when a custom class, such as `MyIndexer`, is used as the index parameter.

The error message indicates that the `MyIndexer` object is not callable, which is consistent with the way the `rename` function handles non-mapping inputs. This suggests that the bug is most likely located in the logic for handling non-mapping inputs in the `rename` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `rename` function incorrectly assumes that non-mapping inputs should be treated in the same way as scalar or list-like inputs. This logic is causing the error when a non-mapping input, such as the `MyIndexer` object, is passed to the function.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `rename` function needs to be updated to handle non-mapping inputs, such as custom classes, in a way that does not raise an error. One possible approach is to check if the input is callable or is a dict-like object. If so, the function should call `super().rename` with the input and kwargs. Otherwise, it should call `self._set_name` with the input and `kwargs.get("inplace")`.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this correction, the `rename` function will handle non-mapping inputs, such as custom classes, without raising errors.
