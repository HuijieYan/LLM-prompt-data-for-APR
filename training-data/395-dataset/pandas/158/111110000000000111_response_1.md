The test case provided attempts to rename the series using an object `i1` of class `MyIndexer`, which is currently not supported and raises a TypeError. The error occurs due to the function `Series.rename` treating anything other than a scalar or list-like as a mapping, leading to a TypeError when it tries to call the non-callable object.

The bug is occurring within the `Series.rename` function, specifically in the `non_mapping` check, which incorrectly handles non-scalar, non-list-like objects. 

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `non_mapping` check to correctly handle non-scalar, non-list-like objects as suggested in the issue description. If the `index` parameter is callable or a dict, it should be passed to the `super().rename()` method, otherwise, it should be treated the same way as a scalar or list-like and set as the series name using `self._set_name()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ... (other docstring content)

    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

This corrected code properly handles the `index` parameter based on whether it is callable, a dictionary, or any other type, resolving the TypeError issue described in the GitHub issue.
