The problem lies in the `rename` method of the `Series` class. The method takes an `index` parameter which can be a scalar, hashable sequence, dict-like or function, but it seems to encounter issues when provided with a custom object `MyIndexer` which is not iterable.

The reason for the bug is that the `rename` method is not handling the case when the `index` is of type `MyIndexer` properly. This custom object is not iterable, causing the TypeError when trying to convert it to a list in the `asarray_tuplesafe` function.

To fix this issue, the `rename` method should handle the `index` parameter appropriately based on its type. If it is a scalar or hashable sequence, it should alter the `Series.name` attribute, and if it is a function or dict-like, it should change the index labels. For cases like `MyIndexer` or other custom objects, it should either be explicitly supported or raise a ValueError to notify the user that the input is not supported.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if isinstance(index, (list, tuple)) or (hasattr(index, "__array__") and callable(index.__array__)):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

In this corrected code, I'm checking if the `index` parameter is either a list, tuple, or an object with a callable `__array__` attribute, and if so, then calling the parent class's `rename` method. Otherwise, it will call the `_set_name` method for other cases like scalar, hashable sequence, or unsupported custom objects.
