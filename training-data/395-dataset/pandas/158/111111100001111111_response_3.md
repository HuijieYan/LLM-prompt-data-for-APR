The issue occurs when the `Series.rename` method is called with an index parameter that is not a scalar or list-like. The error message indicates that the index object is not callable, causing a TypeError.

The bug is likely occurring in the conditional check for non-mapping index types in the `rename` method:

```python
non_mapping = is_scalar(index) or (is_list_like(index) and not is_dict_like(index))
if non_mapping:
    return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
```

The current implementation is incorrectly checking for non-mapping types, which may result in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional check to correctly handle non-mapping index types. We can update the conditional check as follows:

```python
if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
    return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
else:
    return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

This change ensures that anything that isn't a dict or a callable will be treated in the same way as a scalar or list-like, thereby preventing the TypeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this correction, the `Series.rename` method should no longer raise errors on values accepted by the `Series` constructor.
