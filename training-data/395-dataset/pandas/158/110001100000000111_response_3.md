The test case provided attempts to create a pandas Series object with a custom class `MyIndexer` as the name, and then tries to rename the series using an instance of `MyIndexer`. This should be allowed, but it currently raises an error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the code logic that determines whether the index is a mapping or not. This logic is currently incorrectly identifying the custom class `MyIndexer` as a non-mapping, non-scalar object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current logic in the `rename` function does not correctly handle custom classes or callables, resulting in the `MyIndexer` instance being treated as a non-callable object, leading to the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to update the logic in the `rename` function to correctly identify custom classes and callables as valid index labels, and to handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```
