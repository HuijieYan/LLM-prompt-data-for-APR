The bug occurs in the `rename` method of the `Series` class. The error is due to the fact that it does not handle non-mapping objects properly, leading to the TypeError when trying to iterate over a custom `MyIndexer` object in the `asarray_tuplesafe` function.

The bug occurs because the `rename` method treats anything that isn't a scalar or list-like as a mapping. This leads to a TypeError when non-mapping objects are passed as the `index`.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `rename` method should be updated to properly handle non-mapping objects. The condition `if non_mapping` should be replaced with a condition that checks if the index object is callable or is a dictionary-like object. If the index is callable or a dictionary, it should be treated as a mapping. Otherwise, it should be treated the same way as a scalar or list-like object.

The corrected `rename` method is as follows:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    
    ... (existing docstring remains unchanged) ...
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

By making these changes, the `rename` method will properly handle non-mapping objects, preventing the TypeError that occurs when non-mapping objects are passed.
