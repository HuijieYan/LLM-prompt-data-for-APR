The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `index` parameter in the `rename` method of the `Series` class in pandas. The error message indicates that the `MyIndexer` object is not callable, which suggests that the `index` parameter is not being handled correctly.

The buggy code in the `rename` method incorrectly treats anything that isn't a scalar or list-like as a mapping. This causes the code to expect the `index` parameter to be a callable, which leads to the error when it's not.

To fix the bug, the `rename` method should be modified to properly handle the `index` parameter. It should check if the `index` is callable or dict-like and act accordingly. If it's not callable or dict-like, it should pass it to the `_set_name` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ... (other comments and docstring)

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : scalar, hashable sequence, dict-like or function, optional
        dict-like or functions are transformations to apply to the index.
        Scalar or hashable sequence-like will alter the ``Series.name``
        attribute.
    ... (other parameters)

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Series with index labels or name altered.
    """

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this corrected code, the `rename` method properly checks if the `index` is callable or dict-like and handles it accordingly, which should resolve the issue of the `MyIndexer` object not being callable.
