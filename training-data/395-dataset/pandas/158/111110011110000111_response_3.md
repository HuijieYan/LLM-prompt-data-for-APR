The error occurs because the `rename` function in the `Series` class is not handling non-mapping types properly. In the original code, the `rename` function is attempting to treat any non-mapping type as a mapping type, leading to the error.

The error message indicates that the "MyIndexer" object is not iterable, which means that the `rename` function is unable to handle custom indexers properly.

The potential error location is identified in the conditional statement within the `rename` function where it checks for non-mapping types. The condition `non_mapping = is_scalar(index) or (is_list_like(index) and not is_dict_like(index))` is causing the problem.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement in the `rename` function needs to be revised to correctly handle non-mapping types. Instead of checking if the `index` is non-mapping, it should check if the `index` is callable (a function) or a mapping type. If it is callable or a mapping type, then `super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)` should be called. Otherwise, it should call `self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))`.

Here's the corrected `rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

The revised condition checks if `index` is callable or a mapping type, and based on that, it either calls `super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)` or `self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))`. This will handle the non-mapping types properly and prevent the error from occurring.
