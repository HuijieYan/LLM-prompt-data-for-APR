The error occurs when trying to use the `rename` method with a custom indexer as an argument. The error indicates that the `MyIndexer` object is not iterable, suggesting that it is not being handled properly within the `rename` method.

The potential error location within the `rename` method is the condition that checks for non-mapping values:

```python
non_mapping = is_scalar(index) or (
    is_list_like(index) and not is_dict_like(index)
)
if non_mapping:
    return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

The bug occurs because the condition does not handle non-mapping objects properly, leading to the `MyIndexer` object being treated as a non-mapping value and causing the error.

To fix the bug, the `rename` method should be updated to properly handle non-mapping objects, such as the custom indexer `MyIndexer`. The condition that checks for non-mapping values should be modified to handle callable objects and non-mapping objects as well, while treating them the same way as scalar or list-like objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

This updated code properly handles non-mapping objects and ensures that they are treated in the same way as scalar or list-like objects. This should resolve the error and allow the `rename` method to work as intended.
