Potential error location: The potential error is in the `apply_empty_result` method where it tries to apply the function to an empty series to check if it is a reduction function.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because there is no check for whether the `result_type` is 'reduce' or None. It also incorrectly checks for reduction without considering other cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Add a check for `result_type` before attempting to apply the function to an empty series. Also, consider all possible cases for how the function should behave based on the `result_type` and the result of applying the function to an empty series.

Corrected code:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """
    
    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()
    
    # we may need to infer
    if self.result_type == "reduce":
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    
    from pandas import Series
    
    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
    try:
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        if not isinstance(r, Series):
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)

    return self.obj.copy()
```
