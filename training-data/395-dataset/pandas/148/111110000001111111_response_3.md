The issue occurs because the function `apply_empty_result` is incorrectly handling the case where `self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)` returns a value that is not an instance of `Series`.

To fix this, the function needs to be modified to check not only if the return value is an instance of `Series`, but also if it is empty. Additionally, the logic for checking if the result type should be reduced needs to be updated.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    from numpy import nan

    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
    try:
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        should_reduce = (isinstance(r, Series) and r.empty)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
