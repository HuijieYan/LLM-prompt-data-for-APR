The error is in the `apply_empty_result` method of the `FrameApply` class. The method is not handling the empty result case correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior with other DataFrame and Series methods.

The bug occurs because in the `apply_empty_result` method, when an empty series is returned, the method does not handle the result and inference of the reduction function properly. As a result, inconsistent series with NaN values are returned instead of an empty series, causing the assertion errors in the test functions.

To fix the bug, the handling of the empty result case needs to be modified so that when an empty series is returned, it is properly identified as non-reduction or reduction function, and the appropriate series (empty series or series with NaN values) is returned accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        r = None
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass

        if r is not None:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return Series([], index=EMPTY_SERIES.index)
```

With this modification, the empty result case should be handled correctly, and the series will be returned consistently in line with the behavior of other DataFrame and Series methods.
