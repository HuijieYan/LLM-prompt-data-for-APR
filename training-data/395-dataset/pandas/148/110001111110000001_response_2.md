The error message from the test function indicates that the Series returned by the `apply_empty_result` function is different from the expected Series. The values in the returned Series are `nan`, while the expected values are `0.0`, `1.0`, or `False`, depending on the test.

Looking at the `apply_empty_result` function, it seems that the issue lies in the section where it is attempting to infer whether the result should be reduced or not. The logic for inferring reduction is not functioning as intended, leading to incorrect results.

The root cause of this bug is that the function is not handling empty Series correctly and is not correctly inferring whether the function should be a reduction operation or not.

To fix this bug, the logic for inferring reduction needs to be revised to correctly handle empty Series and determine whether to return a reduced result or a copy of the existing object.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series) if not r.empty else True

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

The key change in the corrected code is in the logic to infer reduction. It now correctly handles empty Series and infers whether the result should be reduced based on the output of the function.
