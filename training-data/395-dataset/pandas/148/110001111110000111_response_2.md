The issue is that when an empty DataFrame is used with `df.nunique()`, the result is an empty DataFrame. However, the expected behavior is to get back an empty Series with an empty index.

The problem exists within the `apply_empty_result` method in the source code. This method is called when there is an empty result and it needs to be determined whether to apply reduction or inference.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect implementation of handling the empty series when the function is applied. It fails to return a Series with an empty index when the DataFrame is empty. Instead, it returns an empty DataFrame.

To fix the bug, update the implementation of `apply_empty_result` to correctly handle the case when an empty DataFrame is input and ensure that it returns an empty Series with an empty index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `apply_empty_result`:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=EMPTY_SERIES.index)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected implementation will now return an empty Series with an empty index when the DataFrame is empty. This should resolve the issue reported in the test cases.
