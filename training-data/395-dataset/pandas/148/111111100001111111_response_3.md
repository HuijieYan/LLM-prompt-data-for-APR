The issue occurs when an empty DataFrame is passed to the `apply_empty_result` function. This function tries to determine if the function `f` applied to an empty DataFrame should return a reduction or not. If it should return a reduction (`should_reduce` is True), it tries to construct a new DataFrame with NaN values using `self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)`. However, when the DataFrame is empty, using `self.agg_axis` leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic that determines whether the function should return a reduction or not. We also need to create an empty Series using the correct syntax.

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series(dtype=float)  # Create an empty series with float dtype
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced([np.nan] * len(self.obj.columns), index=self.obj.index)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
