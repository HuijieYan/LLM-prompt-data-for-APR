Potential Error Location:
The code inside the try-except block that is handling the case when should_reduce is False and handling the function call to self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds) might be causing the bug.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The function is checking the type of the result of the self.f call to determine if it should reduce. This process is error-prone, especially on mixed data types.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Instead of relying on the type of the result of the function call to determine if it should reduce, it would be better to handle this logic more explicitly. The code could explicitly check if the result is a scalar or a Series to determine if it should reduce.

Here's the corrected code for the function 'apply_empty_result':

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    from pandas import Series

    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
    r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)

    should_reduce = False
    if isinstance(r, Series) and len(r) == 1:
        should_reduce = True

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
In this corrected code, the logic to determine if the result is a reduction is done explicitly, checking if the result is an instance of Series and its length is 1. This should provide a more reliable indication of whether the function should reduce.
