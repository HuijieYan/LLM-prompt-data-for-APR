Based on the error messages and the test functions provided, it seems that the issue is occurring when applying certain functions (such as `sum`, `prod`, `any`, `all`, and `nunique`) to an empty DataFrame, leading to unexpected results. The problematic function is `apply_empty_result` within the `FrameApply` class.

The bug occurs because the function `apply_empty_result` is not handling the case of applying certain operations to an empty DataFrame correctly. Specifically, it is failing to return the expected results when an empty DataFrame is passed to the function.

To fix this bug, the `apply_empty_result` function should be modified to handle the case of an empty DataFrame more effectively. Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    import numpy as np
    from pandas import Series

    # Check if the result type is not "reduce" or None, then return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # Ensure we need to infer the reduction
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    # If we don't need to reduce, infer by applying the function to an empty series
    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:  # Return a NaN Series with the agg_axis as the index
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:  # Otherwise, return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()
```

By making these changes, the `apply_empty_result` function should now correctly handle the case of an empty DataFrame and return the expected results when applying certain operations to it.
