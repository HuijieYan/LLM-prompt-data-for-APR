The error seems to be originating from the "apply_empty_result" function. This function is called when the input DataFrame is empty, and it tries to infer the result type based on the computation of an empty series.

The issue arises from the line:
```python
return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
```

This line attempts to create a new Series by passing a single NaN value and the index, but it should instead handle the case when the DataFrame is empty more gracefully.

To fix this issue, a better approach would be to return an empty Series instead of trying to construct one with NaN or other values. When the DataFrame is empty, the Series should also be empty.

Here's the corrected "apply_empty_result" function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        return EMPTY_SERIES
```

With this fix, the function will gracefully handle the case of an empty DataFrame and return an empty Series.
