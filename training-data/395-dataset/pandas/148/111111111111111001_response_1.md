The issue with the `apply_empty_result` function is that it is not handling empty DataFrames correctly. This is leading to different results than expected in the test cases.

The function tries to check if the result type is "reduce", and if not, it returns a copy of the existing object. If the result type is "reduce", it tries to infer reduction by checking the result of applying a function to an empty series. However, the actual inference and the handling of the empty series are not done correctly.

To fix the issue, the function should handle the case of an empty DataFrame appropriately and check for the result type before inferring reduction. 

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    
    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj._constructor_expanddim(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We handle the case of an empty DataFrame by returning an appropriate object depending on the result type.
2. We check for the result type before inferring reduction, and handle the empty series according to the result type.

These changes should correctly handle the cases of applying functions to empty DataFrames and result in the expected behavior in the test cases.
