The error is observed when the `apply_empty_result` method is called as part of the test cases `test_apply_funcs_over_empty` and `test_nunique_empty`. The error message clearly states that the expected series and the resulting series are different in terms of values and attributes like dtype.

The potential error location is the `apply_empty_result` method, specifically in the logic where the function `f` is being applied to an empty series. This logic is related to checking whether the result should be reduced or not.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `apply_empty_result` method has a problematic logic flow for inferring the reduction behavior when the function `f` is applied to an empty series. This logic is leading to incorrect results and is causing inconsistencies between the expected and resulting series.

To fix this bug, the logic for inferring reduction behavior when applying the function to an empty series needs to be modified.

```python
# Class declaration containing the buggy function
class FrameApply():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # other methods

    # the corrected apply_empty_result method
    def apply_empty_result(self):
        """
        We have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0.
        
        We will try to apply the function to an empty
        series in order to see if this is a reduction function.
        """
        # If the result_type is reduce or None, return an empty Series
        from pandas import Series
        if self.result_type in ["reduce", None]:
            return Series(dtype='float64')

        # If the result_type is not reduce, then check the reduction behavior
        should_reduce = False
        if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
            EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
            try:
                r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            except Exception:
                pass
            else:
                should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

        # Return the result based on the inferred reduction behavior
        if should_reduce:
            return Series(dtype='float64')
        else:
            return self.obj.copy()
```

The corrected `apply_empty_result` method now returns a correctly formatted empty Series based on the reduction behavior to fix the bug observed in the test cases. The correctness of the updated method should be verified through testing all relevant scenarios.
