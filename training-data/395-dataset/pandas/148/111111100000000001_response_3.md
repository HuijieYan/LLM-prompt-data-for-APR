Potential error location:
The potential error lies in the if condition where the result_type is checked. The logic seems to be incorrect, and it is not handling the case properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the logic to handle empty results and the result_type check is flawed. This is causing incorrect handling of the empty result scenario.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the if condition to properly handle the result_type check and the handling of empty results.
2. Use proper logic to determine if the function needs to be reduced or not based on the result_type.

Corrected code:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    if self.result_type == "reduce":
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
