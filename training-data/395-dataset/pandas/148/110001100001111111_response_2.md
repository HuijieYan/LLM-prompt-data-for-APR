Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the logic that checks if the result type is "reduce" or not. If it is not, then the existing object is copied and returned. Otherwise, the function is applied to an empty series to check if it is a reduction function. However, the logic for checking the result type and inferring the reduction function seems to be incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The current logic for checking the result type and inferring the reduction function is not accurate. This leads to inconsistencies in the output when an empty DataFrame is encountered.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the logic for checking the result type and inferring the reduction function based on the result type. Instead, directly apply the function to an empty series and check the output to determine if it is a reduction function.
2. Ensure that the conditions for inferring the reduction function are correctly implemented and cover all possible scenarios.

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    We have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    
    We will try to apply the function to an empty series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # Apply the function to an empty series to check for reduction
    from pandas import Series
    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
    r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    
    if not isinstance(r, Series):
        # If the function returns a non-Series result, then it is a reduction function
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        # If the function returns a Series, return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This code directly applies the function to an empty series and checks the output to determine if it is a reduction function. It removes the previous inaccurate logic for result type and inference of reduction function. This should provide consistent and correct behavior for the `apply_empty_result` method.
