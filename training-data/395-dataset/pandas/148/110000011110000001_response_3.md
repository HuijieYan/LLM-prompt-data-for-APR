The issue seems to be with the `apply_empty_result` function. This function is designed to handle cases where the result is empty (e.g., at least one axis is 0). It attempts to apply the given function to an empty series.

The bug in the code seems to be related to the handling of the function to be applied. The function `self.f` is applied to an empty series, and the result is checked for being an instance of `pandas.Series`. If it is not, reduction is inferred. However, the logic for handling the result of the function is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior and assertion failures in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the result of the function should be corrected. Additionally, proper error handling should be added to handle exceptions raised during the application of `self.f` to an empty series.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])

        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            should_reduce = False  # Handle exceptions by not reducing
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj.aggregate(np.nan, axis=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected code addresses the issues in the original function and provides proper error handling for exceptions that may occur during the application of the function to an empty series. The logic for inferring reduction has been adjusted as well to ensure correct behavior.
