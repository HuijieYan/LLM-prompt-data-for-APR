The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the logic for handling an empty result. The function is designed to handle an empty result by attempting to apply a function to an empty series. However, the logic for checking whether the result should be reduced or not seems faulty, which leads to incorrect values being returned. 

The buggy function checks if the result type is not in ["reduce", None], but it should instead check if the result type is in ["reduce", None]. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the function applied to the empty series does not return an exception. It simply sets should_reduce to False, which might not be the correct logic.

To fix the bug, an alternative approach is to check if the resulting "r" value is not empty instead of simply checking if it's an instance of a Series. If the "r" value is not empty, the function should not reduce the result. If it is empty, the function should reduce the result.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """
    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    # we are asked to reduce or infer reduction
    if self.result_type in ["reduce", None]:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        r = np.nan
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass

        if not r:
            should_reduce = True
        else:
            should_reduce = False
    else:
        # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
        # so just return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
