The bug in the provided code is occurring because the function `apply_empty_result` is not handling the case of an empty DataFrame properly. It seems to be trying to apply a function to an empty series to check if it is a reduction function, but it doesn't handle this case correctly.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the case of an empty DataFrame more explicitly and should not rely on inferring reduction based on the result type alone. Instead, it should specifically check for a reduction function and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    
    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    from pandas import Series

    # Check if it's a reduction function
    if self.result_type == "reduce":
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    elif self.result_type is None:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # Handle the case of an empty DataFrame
    if self.obj.empty:
        empty_series = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(empty_series, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            if isinstance(r, Series):
                return self.obj.copy()
            else:
                return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected code handles the case of an empty DataFrame explicitly and checks for different conditions to decide whether the function is a reduction function or not. It also checks the result type and handles the `.empty` attribute of the DataFrame. This should fix the bug and resolve the issues observed during the testing of the `apply_empty_result` function.
