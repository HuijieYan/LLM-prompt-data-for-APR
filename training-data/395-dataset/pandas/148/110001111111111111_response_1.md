The bug in the `apply_empty_result` function lies in the conditional check for `should_reduce` and the subsequent operations based on that variable. The function should return an empty series if the DataFrame is empty, which is in line with the behavior of `Series.nunique()` when the series is empty.

The issue is occurring because the `should_reduce` variable is incorrectly determined based on the result_type and has inconsistent behavior. This results in different behavior for `nunique()`, which returns an empty DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the conditional check for `should_reduce` should be modified based on the behavior of `Series.nunique()` when the Series is empty, ensuring that the function returns an empty Series when the DataFrame is empty.

Here's the corrected function for `apply_empty_result`:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    from pandas import Series

    # Check to see if the DataFrame is empty
    if len(self.obj) == 0:
        return Series([], dtype='float64')

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This modified function ensures that if the DataFrame is empty, it returns an empty Series with the correct data type ('float64'). This aligns with the expected behavior for reduction functions on an empty DataFrame.
