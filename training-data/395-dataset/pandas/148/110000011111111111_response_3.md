The bug in the provided function is likely at the point where it tries to apply the function to an empty series in order to see if it's a reduction function. The problematic line of code might be this one:
`should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)`

The bug is occurring because the function is incorrectly checking if the variable `r` is an instance of the Series class to determine if the result should be reduced. The variable `r` is likely not getting the correct value assigned to it, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, you may want to consider the following approaches:
1. Verify that the application of the function to an empty series is functioning correctly and that it properly returns the expected result.
2. Ensure that the check for the reduction of the result (`should_reduce`) relying on `isinstance(r, Series)` is implemented correctly.
3. Validate the output of `self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)` and its handling for edge cases.

Provided below is the corrected version of the given function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    
    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        if isinstance(r, Series):
            should_reduce = False

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected function ensures that the application of the function to an empty series is performed properly, and the check for result reduction based on the type of `r` is also handled correctly.
