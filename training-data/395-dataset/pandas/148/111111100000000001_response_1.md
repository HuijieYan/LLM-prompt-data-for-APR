Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the given function "apply_empty_result" lies in the logic used to determine whether the result should be reduced or not. The code is trying to infer if the result is a reduction function, but the logic for doing this is not accurate.

Reason for the Bug:
The code is not accurately determining whether the result should be reduced or not. This is leading to incorrect handling of the result, which can cause unexpected behavior.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine if the result should be reduced or not. This can be achieved by checking the result type and handling the empty result accordingly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis())
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
