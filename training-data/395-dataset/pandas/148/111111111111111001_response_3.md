The buggy function `apply_empty_result` in the provided code is meant to handle the case when the input DataFrame is empty and apply a reduction function to it. However, there are issues in the function logic that cause it to return incorrect results.

The actual issue lies in the condition where it checks if the result type should be reduced. The `should_reduce` variable is not being correctly determined, which leads to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the creation and processing of an empty series is not being handled properly, resulting in incorrect decision making regarding whether to reduce or not.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Adjust the logic for determining `should_reduce` based on whether the function should actually reduce the inputs.
2. Use proper error handling to determine if the function applied to the empty series results in a reduction or not.
3. Make necessary adjustments to handle the creation of an empty series as part of the decision-making process.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    empty_series = Series([], dtype=float)

    if not should_reduce:
        try:
            r = self.f(empty_series, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

By making the above changes, the `apply_empty_result` function should now handle empty DataFrames and apply reduction functions appropriately. This should resolve the issues encountered in the test functions.
