The issue here seems to be with the implementation of the `apply_empty_result` function in the pandas library. The function is meant to handle cases where the result of an operation is empty, but it currently has issues handling empty series, leading to inconsistent behavior when dealing with DataFrame and Series objects.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where it determines whether to reduce or return an empty copy of the object. The issue seems to be related to the handling of an empty series and the proper way to infer reduction.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are related to changes in behavior when dealing with empty DataFrame or Series objects in the pandas library. It seems that the behavior has been inconsistent across different pandas versions, leading to unexpected results for operations like `nunique()`.

To fix the bug, the function `apply_empty_result` needs to be modified to explicitly handle the case of an empty Series and infer whether reduction is needed. Also, the implementation should be updated to be robust across different pandas versions. The corrected code for the problematic function `apply_empty_result` is as follows:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=list(self.obj.index))
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the case of an empty series by creating an empty series and inferring reduction based on the result of the function applied to the empty series. Additionally, we ensure that the behavior is consistent across different pandas versions by explicitly specifying the index as a list.
