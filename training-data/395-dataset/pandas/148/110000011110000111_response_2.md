The buggy function `apply_empty_result` is designed to handle the situation where there is an empty result, indicating that at least 1 axis is 0.

The issue with the function lies in the logic for handling the empty series and inferring reduction. The function attempts to apply the provided function `self.f` to an empty series to determine if it's a reduction function. However, the logic for checking if the result should be reduced or not is flawed.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if there's an empty result and then proceed to perform the necessary checks to infer if the result should be reduced or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import Series

def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # We check if it's a reduction function
    if self.result_type == "reduce":
        # If it is a reduction function, return a new Series with np.nan values and the agg_axis as the index
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        # If it's not a reduction function, just return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()
```

Based on the nature of the function and its responsibility, it is important to keep the logic simple and directly check if the function should be treated as a reduction function, without any unnecessary and complex checks.
