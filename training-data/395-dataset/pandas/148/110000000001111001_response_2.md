The issue with the function is that it's trying to apply a function to an empty series and then use the result to determine if the function should be reduced. The logic for applying the function and inferring reduction is not entirely correct.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic for determining reduction. Instead of trying to apply the function to an empty series, we can directly check if the result is a series or not to infer reduction.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import Series

def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor()

    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
    r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)

    if isinstance(r, Series):
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
