The issue is in the `apply_empty_result` function where it tries to execute the function `f` on an empty series, `EMPTY_SERIES`, to determine if this is a reduction function. The bug is that the function tries to catch the exception but then continues to execute the rest of the code even if an exception is caught.

This can lead to incorrect results and should be fixed by properly catching the exception and then setting `should_reduce` based on whether an exception is caught or not.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            should_reduce = True  # Set should_reduce to True if an exception is caught

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
