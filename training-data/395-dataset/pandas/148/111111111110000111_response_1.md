The error is occurring when the function `apply_empty_result` is called during the test cases that involve an empty DataFrame on which aggregate functions are being applied. The error message suggests that the series values are different and that an inconsistency in the result is causing the failure of the comparison.

After inspecting the code, it seems that the behavior of the function `apply_empty_result` is not consistent with the expected functionality when applied to an empty DataFrame. The function is trying to handle a case where an empty result is being returned, but the logic inside is not correctly capturing and handling this situation.

To fix the issue, the function `apply_empty_result` should be corrected to consistently handle the case of an empty result, specifically for an empty DataFrame. It should return an empty Series in such cases. This will ensure consistency with the behavior of the `nunique` function when applied to an empty DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    We have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    We will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """
    from pandas import Series

    # If we have an empty result, return an empty Series
    return Series([]) if self.obj.empty else self.obj.copy()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case of an empty result when applied to an empty DataFrame, and it will return an empty Series to ensure consistency with the expected functionality, especially when using functions like `nunique`.
