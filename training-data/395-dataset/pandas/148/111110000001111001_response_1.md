The function `apply_empty_result` is causing an error because it is not defined to accept any parameters other than `self`. However, in the expected cases, the function should accept additional parameters such as `args` and `kwds`.

To fix this issue, the function signature needs to be updated to accept `args` and `kwds` parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self, *args, **kwds):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    we will try to apply the function to an empty series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *args, **kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
