The issue seems to be with the `apply_empty_result` function in the `FrameApply` class. The function is trying to determine if an axis is 0 and handle the result accordingly.

The potential error is likely in the code that handles the empty result. It is checking for the `result_type` to be `"reduce"` or `None` and then proceeds with operations. However, the if condition is ignoring scenarios where `self.result_type` is any value other than `"reduce"` or `None`.

The bug occurs because the function makes no check for the empty series case when `self.result_type` is neither `"reduce"` nor `None`. This can result in incorrect inference of reduction and lead to incorrect operation return values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario when `self.result_type` is not `"reduce"` or `None` and checks correctly for an empty series. Also, the function needs to return the expected types for the variables `should_reduce`, `EMPTY_SERIES`, `r`, and `Series`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # We are not asked to reduce or infer reduction, so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # We may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected function should handle the scenarios more accurately and return the expected types for the internal variables, therefore mitigating the potential bug and providing the appropriate treatment for empty result cases.
