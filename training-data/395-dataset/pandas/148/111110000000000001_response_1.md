Potential error location: The potential error is in the `f` function, which is not defined within the class and should be an instance method.

Reason for the bug: The `f` function is defined as a standalone function within the class, but it should be an instance method if it's intended to be used within the class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define the `f` function as an instance method within the class.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class FrameApply():
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def agg_axis(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # fixed signature of the relative function in this class
    def f(self, x):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the fixed function
    def apply_empty_result(self):
        """
        we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    
        we will try to apply the function to an empty
        series in order to see if this is a reduction function
        """
    
        # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
        # so just return a copy of the existing object
        if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
            return self.obj.copy()
    
        # we may need to infer
        should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
        from pandas import Series
    
        if not should_reduce:
    
            EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
            try:
                r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
