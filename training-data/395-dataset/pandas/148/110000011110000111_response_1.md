The bug in the `apply_empty_result` method is causing incorrect or unexpected behavior when using the `nunique` function on an empty DataFrame. The method attempts to handle empty results but fails to do so correctly in all cases, leading to inconsistency in the results. This causes failures in two test functions `test_apply_funcs_over_empty` and `test_nunique_empty`.

The potential error location within the `apply_empty_result` method is the handling of the case where `should_reduce` is False. The method attempts to infer whether reduction is necessary by using an empty Series `EMPTY_SERIES`, and then tries to apply the function to it. However, the check for inferring reduction is not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect determination of whether the reduction is necessary.

The bug occurs due to inconsistencies in handling an empty data set and inferring reduction for the applied function. The method does not correctly handle the case when a reduction is required based on an empty result. This leads to inconsistent behavior and failed assertions in the test functions.

To fix the bug, the `apply_empty_result` method should be modified to correctly handle the case when a function is applied to an empty Series or DataFrame and determine whether a reduction is necessary.

Here is the corrected `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # Get a unique Series from the DataFrame
    series = self.obj.iloc[:, 0] if not self.obj.empty else self.obj  # Select a column as a Series

    from pandas import Series, np

    try:
        r = self.f(series, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

The corrected method should handle the case of an empty DataFrame or Series correctly and infer the reduction as necessary based on the behavior of the applied function. This should address the bug and ensure consistent behavior when using reduction functions on empty data.
