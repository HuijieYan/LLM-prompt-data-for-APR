The error occurs when the `nunique` method is called on an empty DataFrame. The method currently returns an empty DataFrame, while it should return an empty Series. The bug also causes the `DataFrame.nunique` and `Series.nunique` methods to behave inconsistently when the DataFrame is empty.

The problem lies in the `apply_empty_result` method, particularly with the condition `if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None"]`. When the `result_type` is `"reduce"`, it's incorrectly setting `should_reduce` to `False` and returning a copy of the existing object, which leads to an incorrect result.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to change the condition `if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None"]` to properly handle when the `result_type` is `"reduce"`.
2. Inside the `if should_reduce` block, we'll invoke the `_constructor_sliced` method for the `self.obj` and pass `index=self.agg_axis` as an argument to create the correct result when the function is intended to be reducing.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj._constructor_expanddim(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
```

These changes ensure that the `should_reduce` flag is set correctly and that the correct type of object is constructed based on the state when the result is empty. This will address the inconsistencies and the incorrect results observed in the test cases.
