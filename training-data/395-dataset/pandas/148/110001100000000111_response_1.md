This bug seems to be related to the behavior of the `.nunique()` method for empty DataFrames. The issue is that when a DataFrame is empty, the `.nunique()` method returns an empty DataFrame instead of an empty Series, which is inconsistent with how a Series behaves when it is empty.

The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the `apply_empty_result` method, specifically in the if condition `if not should_reduce:`. The logic here does not handle the empty Series case correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior for empty DataFrames.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check for an empty DataFrame and return an empty Series with the correct dtype instead of an empty DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
# Corrected function of apply_empty_result
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    We have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    We will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """
    
    # We are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # So just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()
    
    # We may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
    from pandas import Series
    
    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], dtype=float)  # Return an empty Series with dtype float
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
    
    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code, I have added `dtype=float` to the `EMPTY_SERIES` constructor to ensure that an empty Series with the correct dtype is returned when the DataFrame is empty. This should fix the inconsistency in behavior between DataFrames and Series when they are empty.
