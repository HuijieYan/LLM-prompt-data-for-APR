The buggy function `apply_empty_result` returns an incorrect result under certain conditions, leading to failed tests.

The error messages from the test functions provide details about the incorrect results compared to the expected results. The error message indicates that the functions `sum`, `prod`, `any`, and `all` return NaN or incorrect dtype.

The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of the logic to identify empty results and the wrong type of series creation. 

To fix the bug, we need to address the following issues:
1. The function has issues with handling empty series or arrays and checking for reduction.
2. Inappropriate handling of the check for `should_reduce`
3. Incorrect identification of a reduction function

To address these issues, we should:
1. Properly check for empty series and apply the function to handle the empty series for inference of reduction.
2. Define the correct logic for checking the need for reduction.
3. Generate Series of appropriate types.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], dtype=float)  # Creating an empty series of appropriate type
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    agg_series = Series(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)  # Creating the series with np.nan of appropriate index
    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(agg_series, index=self.obj.index)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected function fixes the handling of empty series, infer reduction, and the creation of series of appropriate types and indices to help in successful reduction operations and address the issues leading to failed test cases.
