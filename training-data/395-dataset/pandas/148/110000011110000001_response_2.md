The function apply_empty_result is attempting to handle cases where the result is empty or if it's a reduction function. However, it seems that the logic for handling these cases is incorrect, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

The problematic part of the code appears to be the logic around the 'should_reduce' variable and the handling of the reduction case. The function is trying to determine whether to reduce the data or not based on the 'result_type' attribute, but this logic is flawed.

The if condition 
```
if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
```
seems to be the issue. It is supposed to check if the function 'self.f' applied to an empty series returns a series. If it does, then it should set should_reduce to True, otherwise, it should remain False. However, this logic is inverted.

A possible approach to fixing this bug could be to refactor the logic for determining whether to reduce or not based on the result_type attribute and get rid of the invalid inversion of the 'should_reduce' variable. Additionally, proper exception handling should be implemented around the function 'self.f' call to avoid unintentionally masking errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    Handle cases where the result is empty or if it's a reduction function
    """

    if self.result_type in [None, "reduce"]:
        # Attempt to call the function on an empty series
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            # Error occurred, use safe reduction mode
            should_reduce = True
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

        if should_reduce:
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
        else:
            return self.obj.copy()
    else:
        # Return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()
```
