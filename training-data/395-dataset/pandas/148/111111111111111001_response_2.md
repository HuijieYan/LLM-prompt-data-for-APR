The error is occurring in the `apply_empty_result` method of the `FrameApply` class. The function seems to be trying to handle empty results in certain cases, and it checks whether it should reduce the result based on the variable `should_reduce`.

The issue seems to be around the handling of empty Series and the inferring of whether the result should be reduced or not. There are also some inconsistencies with the variable `r` being set to specific values and then being used to infer whether the result should be reduced.

To fix the bug, it might be necessary to revisit the logic for handling empty results and inferring whether the result should be reduced. It is also important to ensure that the `r` variable is being set and used correctly for the desired logic.

Here's the corrected code with comments for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    # ... previous code ...

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        # Create an empty Series
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            # Apply the function to the empty Series
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            # Infer whether the result should be reduced based on the return type
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        # If the result should be reduced, return a new Series with NaN values
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        # Otherwise, just return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()
```

By correcting the logic for handling empty results and inferring whether the result should be reduced, the issues with the original buggy function should be resolved.
