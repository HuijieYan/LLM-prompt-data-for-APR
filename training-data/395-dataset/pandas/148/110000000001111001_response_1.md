Potential Error Location:
The following lines could potentially be causing the issue:
```python
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
```

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is checking for whether to reduce the series or not using the variable `should_reduce`. It is computed based on the result of a function `f` applied to an empty series.
2. The issue may occur when the function `f` has different return types based on input. This can lead to incorrect evaluation of `should_reduce`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the function `f` will always return the same type for the same input. If it can return different types, then the `should_reduce` logic needs to be revised.
2. Use a try-except block to handle potential errors occurring when calling function `f` with an empty series, instead of catching all exceptions and moving on without considering the result.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
        except Exception:
            pass

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
