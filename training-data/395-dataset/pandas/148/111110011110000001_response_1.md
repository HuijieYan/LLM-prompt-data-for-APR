The `apply_empty_result` method is meant to handle applying a function to an empty DataFrame, but it currently contains a bug which causes errors when the DataFrame is empty.

The errors in the test function `test_apply_funcs_over_empty` are happening because the DataFrame being created is empty, and when the `apply` function is called on an empty DataFrame, it does not return the expected result. This is likely due to the issues with the `apply_empty_result` function.

The `apply_empty_result` method tries to handle the case where the DataFrame is empty by returning a copy of the existing object when it's not asked to reduce or infer reduction. However, the code to handle the case when reduction is needed seems to be incorrect. It attempts to check for reduction by applying the function to an empty Series, but the way it's checking for reduction doesn't seem correct, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the code in the `apply_empty_result` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when reduction is needed.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        # Check if the function is a reduction function
        try:
            empty_series = Series([])
            r = self.agg_axis(empty_series)
            should_reduce = r != 0
        except Exception:
            should_reduce = False

    if should_reduce:
        # If reduction is needed, return the reduced object
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        # If no reduction is needed, return a copy of the object
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code, we have modified the logic to correctly check for reduction, and to handle the case when the DataFrame is empty. This should rectify the issues with the incorrect results and assertion errors in the test cases.
