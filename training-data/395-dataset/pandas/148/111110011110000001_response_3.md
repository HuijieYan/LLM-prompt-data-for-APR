The `apply_empty_result` function is designed to handle cases where the result is empty. But it seems to be causing issues when applied to certain functions such as `sum`, `prod`, `any`, and `all`. 

Looking at the test case, the `apply_empty_result` function is being called with functions like `sum`, `prod`, `any`, and `all`, which return a scalar value (e.g., sum of all elements, product of all elements, etc.) when applied to empty DataFrames or Series. The bug seems to be happening when the `apply_empty_result` function is trying to handle these scalar values.

The problem is likely occurring because the logic within the `apply_empty_result` function doesn't handle scalar values properly. It seems to be relying on verifying the result type and then calling a separate function `f` to calculate the result, but this logic is not handling scalar values correctly.

One approach for fixing this bug would be to check if the result of the function `f` is a scalar value and handle it accordingly. Instead of trying to create a Series or handle reduction functions, the function should return the scalar result directly.

Here's the corrected `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    Handle cases where the result is empty
    """

    # if the result type is not specified, return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # calculate the result using the provided function f
    try:
        result = self.f(self.obj, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    except Exception as e:
        # handle exception if the calculation fails
        return self.obj.copy()
    
    # if the result is a scalar value, return it directly
    if isinstance(result, (int, float, str, bool)):
        return result
    else:
        # if the result is not a scalar value, return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This updated function tries to directly calculate the result using the provided function `f` and returns the scalar result directly if applicable. This should address the issues encountered when applying reduction functions to empty DataFrames or Series and produce the expected results.
