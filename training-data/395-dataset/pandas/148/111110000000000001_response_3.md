Potential error location: 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `f(x)` method. It seems to be a standalone function inside the class instead of a method, which should take `self` as the first parameter.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The `f(x)` function inside the class should be a method and take `self` as the first parameter in order to access class attributes and methods. 

Approaches for fixing the bug: 

To fix the bug, the `f(x)` function should be converted to a method by adding `self` as the first parameter.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class FrameApply():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def agg_axis(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # corrected signature of a relative function in this class
    def f(self, x):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # corrected apply_empty_result function
    def apply_empty_result(self):
        """
        we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
        we will try to apply the function to an empty
        series in order to see if this is a reduction function
        """

        # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
        # so just return a copy of the existing object
        if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
            return self.obj.copy()

        # we may need to infer
        should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

        from pandas import Series

        if not should_reduce:

            EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
            try:
                r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            except Exception:
                pass
            else:
                should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

        if should_reduce:
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
        else:
            return self.obj.copy()
