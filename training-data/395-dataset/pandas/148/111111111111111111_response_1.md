The issue occurs when the `nunique` function is applied to an empty DataFrame. The function returns an empty DataFrame instead of an empty Series with the expected output. The error message indicates that the data type of the result is also incorrect, causing inconsistencies in the test case.

The potential error location is within the `apply_empty_result` function, where the function attempts to handle an empty result. The issue may be related to the construction of the result and the data type of the series.

The bug occurs because the function `apply_empty_result` does not handle the case of an empty result correctly. It returns a DataFrame instead of a Series, resulting in inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, update the `apply_empty_result` function to return an empty Series with the correct data type when the result is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], dtype=float)  # Create an empty Series with the correct data type
        return EMPTY_SERIES
    
    return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
```

By returning an empty Series with the correct data type when the result is empty, the function will handle this case properly, and the test cases should pass without inconsistencies.
