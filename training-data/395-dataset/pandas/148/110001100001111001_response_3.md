Potential error location: The main issue in the function is with the logic used to determine whether the result should be reduced or not. Additionally, the try-except block to handle potential exceptions is not used effectively.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The logic to determine whether the result should be reduced or not is not correctly implemented.
2. The try-except block catches all exceptions, regardless of whether they are related to the function being called or not.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Revise the logic used to determine whether the result should be reduced or not and make sure it covers all cases.
2. Use the try-except block to specifically catch exceptions related to the function being called and handle them accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    We have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0.
    
    We will try to apply the function to an empty series in order to see if this is a reduction function.
    """
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], dtype=np.float64)
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
        except Exception:
            pass

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
