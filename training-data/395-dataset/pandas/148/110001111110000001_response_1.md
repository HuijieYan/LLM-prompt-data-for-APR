The buggy function `apply_empty_result` returns incorrect results when trying to apply reduction functions such as "sum", "prod", "any", "all" to an empty DataFrame. This causes the test cases `test_apply_funcs_over_empty` to fail and as a result the subsequent test `test_nunique_empty` fails as well, due to which the error messages are produced.

The issue seems to be with the logic for handling empty DataFrames. When an empty DataFrame is passed to these functions, the application of the function to the empty series returns incorrect results. For example, when `df.sum()` is called, it returns [nan, nan, nan] instead of [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Similarly, when `df.nunique()` is called, it returns an empty DataFrame instead of a Series(0, index=df.columns).

One approach to fix this bug is to modify the logic for handling empty DataFrames to correctly return empty Series or DataFrame depending on the function being applied.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
        """
        we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    
        we will try to apply the function to an empty
        series in order to see if this is a reduction function
        """
    
        # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
        # so just return a copy of the existing object
        if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
            return self.obj.copy()
    
        # we may need to infer
        should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
        from pandas import Series, DataFrame
    
        if not should_reduce:
    
            EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
            try:
                r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            except Exception:
                pass
            else:
                if isinstance(r, Series) and len(r) == 0 and self.obj.shape[0] == 0:
                    return DataFrame(columns=self.obj.columns)  # Return an empty DataFrame
                else:
                    return r  # Return the result obtained from applying the function to an empty series
    
        if should_reduce:
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
        else:
            return self.obj.copy()
```

The corrected code includes a check to return an empty DataFrame when an empty DataFrame is passed to reduction functions or returning the result obtained from applying the function to an empty series for non-reduction functions. This should resolve the issue with incorrect results and the failing test cases.
