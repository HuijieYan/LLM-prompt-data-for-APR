The bug in the provided code is likely due to the `agg_axis()` function call within the conditional block. The error message indicates that "index" is not a recognized option, which suggests that `agg_axis` was intended to be a function call, but it's being treated as an index instead.

The provided function `apply_empty_result()` attempts to apply a function (`self.f`) to an empty series. The attempt to apply the function is causing issues.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the function application to an empty series properly.

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])

        # Attempt to apply the function to the empty series
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
        except Exception as e:
            # Deal with the exception, if necessary
            pass

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis())
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected code explicitly calls the `agg_axis` function with `self.agg_axis()` to properly obtain the index. It also handles the exception for applying the function to an empty series and updates the `should_reduce` flag accordingly.
