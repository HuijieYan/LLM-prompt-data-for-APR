The potential error in the problematic function is that the function `f(x)` is not properly defined within the class. Additionally, the usage of `self.f` within the `apply_empty_result` function to call `f(x)` may lead to a NameError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `f(x)` function is not defined in a way that makes it easily accessible within the class. This may also cause issues when trying to call the function with `self.f`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly define the `f(x)` function within the class and make it accessible from other methods using `self.f`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
import numpy as np
from pandas import Series

class FrameApply():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def agg_axis(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def f(self, x, *args, **kwds):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def apply_empty_result(self):
        """
        we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    
        we will try to apply the function to an empty
        series in order to see if this is a reduction function
        """
    
        # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
        # so just return a copy of the existing object
        if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
            return self.obj.copy()
    
        # we may need to infer
        should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
        if not should_reduce:
            EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
            try:
                r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            except Exception:
                pass
            else:
                should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
    
        if should_reduce:
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
        else:
            return self.obj.copy()
```
