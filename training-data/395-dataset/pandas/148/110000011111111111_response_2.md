The issue is likely occurring in the `apply_empty_result` method, where it is not returning the expected output in various cases. The function is not handling the scenario of an empty DataFrame and thus returning different types and incorrect results. As a result, the test cases are failing with inconsistent behavior and attribute mismatches.

The root cause of the bug is that the function `apply_empty_result` is not checking for an empty DataFrame and returning different types and results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply_empty_result` method to handle the scenario of an empty DataFrame correctly and return expected results in all situations.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    Handle the case of an empty result when at least 1 axis is 0
    """
    import numpy as np
    from pandas import Series

    if self.obj.empty:
        return Series([])

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected function now includes a check for an empty DataFrame and returns a Series with an empty list if the DataFrame is empty. It also addresses the issue of inconsistent attribute types and results by ensuring that the function returns the correct output for all cases, including where the DataFrame is empty.
