The issue is that the apply_empty_result method in the FrameApply class is not working as expected when dealing with empty DataFrames and empty Series. The should_reduce variable is not being set correctly and the function is not returning the expected empty Series in certain cases.

It seems that the main issue is the logic for determining whether the function should reduce. This logic should be adjusted so that it returns the correct should_reduce value.

One approach to fixing this bug could be to modify the logic for determining should_reduce. We can also adjust the error handling to properly return an empty Series when the function is not a reduction function.

Here's the corrected code for the apply_empty_result method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return EMPTY_SERIES
```
