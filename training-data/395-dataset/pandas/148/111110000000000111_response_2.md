The issue is related to `DataFrame.nunique()` returning an empty DataFrame when the original DataFrame is empty, whereas `Series.nunique()` returns 0 in the case of an empty Series.

1. The error seems to be occurring in the `apply_empty_result` method of the `FrameApply` class.

2. The issue is caused by the handling of empty cases in the `apply_empty_result` method.

3. The `apply_empty_result` method does not handle the case of an empty series correctly when checking for the reduction type.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply_empty_result` method to handle the empty series correctly and ensure that the correct value is returned when dealing with an empty DataFrame or Series.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            should_reduce = True  # Set should_reduce to True if an exception is caught
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return pd.Series()  # Return an empty Series when it's not a reduction
```

With this fix, the `apply_empty_result` method correctly handles the case of an empty DataFrame or Series and returns an empty series when it's not a reduction, consistent with the behavior of `Series.nunique()` when applied to an empty Series.
