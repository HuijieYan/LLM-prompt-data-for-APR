Potential error location: 
- In the block of code where the pre_processing and post_processing functions are being checked for callable types, there is an error. It is checking if post_processing is callable twice instead of checking if pre_processing is callable.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The bug occurred because the code is checking if post_processing is callable instead of checking if pre_processing is callable. This results in a redundant check and a missing check for the pre_processing function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
- Check if the pre_processing function is callable before performing the further checks.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_cythonized_result(
    self,
    how,
    grouper,
    aggregate=False,
    cython_dtype=None,
    needs_values=False,
    needs_mask=False,
    needs_ngroups=False,
    result_is_index=False,
    pre_processing=None,
    post_processing=None,
    **kwargs
):

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if result_is_index and aggregate:
        raise ValueError("'result_is_index' and 'aggregate' cannot both be True!")
    if post_processing:
        if not callable(post_processing):  # Fix: corrected from checking pre_processing to post_processing
            raise ValueError("'post_processing' must be a callable!")
    if pre_processing:
        if not callable(pre_processing):
            raise ValueError("'pre_processing' must be a callable!")  # Fix: corrected from checking post_processing to pre_processing
        if not needs_values:
            raise ValueError(
                "Cannot use 'pre_processing' without specifying 'needs_values'!"
            )

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```
