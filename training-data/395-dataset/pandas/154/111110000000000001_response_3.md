The potential error location within the function is in the various conditional statements and partial function application.

The bug occurs because of incorrect conditional checks and checks for callable functions, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional checks and ensure that the pre_processing and post_processing arguments are callable functions before they are used as such.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_cythonized_result(
    self,
    how,
    grouper,
    aggregate=False,
    cython_dtype=None,
    needs_values=False,
    needs_mask=False,
    needs_ngroups=False,
    result_is_index=False,
    pre_processing=None,
    post_processing=None,
    **kwargs
):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if result_is_index and aggregate:
        raise ValueError("'result_is_index' and 'aggregate' cannot both be True!")

    if post_processing:
        if not callable(post_processing):
            raise ValueError("'post_processing' must be a callable!")

    if pre_processing:
        if not callable(pre_processing):
            raise ValueError("'pre_processing' must be a callable!")
        if needs_values and not callable(pre_processing):
            raise ValueError("Cannot use 'pre_processing' without specifying a callable!")

    # ... (omitted code) ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for the pre_processing function to ensure that it is callable and also added a check to verify if needs_values is True before checking if pre_processing is a callable function. Additionally, we have added a check for the post_processing function to ensure that it is callable.
