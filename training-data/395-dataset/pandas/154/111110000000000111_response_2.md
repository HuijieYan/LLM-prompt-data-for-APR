Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the _get_cythonized_result method, specifically in the partial function calls.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the partial function calls within the _get_cythonized_result method. The partial function is being used to modify the result in place, but it seems to be causing the timezone information to be lost when shifting the datetime column.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix this bug is to handle the timezone information explicitly within the partial function calls. This might involve passing the timezone information along with the datetime values and ensuring that it is preserved during the partial function operations.

Another approach could involve modifying the internal Cython implementation to support timezone-aware datetime objects more effectively.

Corrected code for the _get_cythonized_result method:

```python
