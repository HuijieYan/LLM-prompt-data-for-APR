Potential error location: The error is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code, but there seem to be some potential issues with the pre_processing and post_processing checks. The error message related to 'post_processing' and 'pre_processing' being non-callable suggests that it might be due to incorrect variable types or misplacement of these checks.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug might be occurring due to incorrect variable types being checked for callability, or the checks for 'pre_processing' and 'post_processing' being placed incorrectly within the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: First, the checks for 'pre_processing' and 'post_processing' should be verified to ensure they are placed at the correct locations within the code. Then, the variable types for these functions should be checked to ensure they are callable.

Corrected code:
```python
def _get_cythonized_result(
    self,
    how,
    grouper,
    aggregate=False,
    cython_dtype=None,

    needs_mask=False,
    needs_ngroups=False,
    result_is_index=False,
    pre_processing=None,
    post_processing=None,
    **kwargs
):
    """
