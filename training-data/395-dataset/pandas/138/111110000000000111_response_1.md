Potential error location: The error is likely occurring at the `x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)` line within the `_coerce_to_type` function.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is likely caused by the function trying to convert boolean values to integers using `x.view(np.int64)`, which is resulting in the `TypeError` because boolean values cannot be directly converted to integers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of trying to convert boolean values to integers, the function should handle boolean values separately and not attempt to convert them to another data type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]':
        dtype = 'datetime64[ns]'
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        dtype = 'timedelta64[ns]'
    
    return x, dtype
```
In the corrected code, the function checks if `x` is a `pd.Series` and if its `dtype` is `'datetime64[ns]'` or `'timedelta64[ns]'`. If so, it sets the `dtype` accordingly. Otherwise, it returns `x` and `dtype` without trying to convert boolean values to integers.
