The buggy function is _coerce_to_type, which is used internally by the qcut function. The function tries to coerce the input data to numeric type so that qcut can handle it. However, the code contains a flaw that causes it to raise a TypeError when dealing with boolean Series or ndarrays.

The error occurs due to an attempt to perform arithmetic operations on boolean data types, which is not supported in numpy.

To fix this bug, you would need to modify the _coerce_to_type function to handle boolean data types differently. Instead of performing arithmetic operations directly on boolean values, the function should check the data type and convert it into an appropriate numeric type before performing any operations.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    # Check if the input is a boolean Series or ndarray
    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype.name == 'bool':
        # Convert boolean values to integers (0 for False, 1 for True)
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')
    elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and x.dtype.name == 'bool':
        # Convert boolean values to integers (0 for False, 1 for True)
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')
    else:
        dtype = None

    return x, dtype
```

This corrected function checks for boolean data types and converts them to integers before performing any arithmetic operations. This should prevent the TypeError from occurring when the qcut function is called with boolean data.
