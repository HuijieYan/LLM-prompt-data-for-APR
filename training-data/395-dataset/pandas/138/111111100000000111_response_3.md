Based on the error messages and the test case provided, it seems that the issue is related to the casting of boolean values to float64 during the qcut operation. This suggests that the problem may lie in the conversion of datetime/timedelta types to numeric in the _coerce_to_type function.

The error occurred during the qcut operation, which involves the conversion of boolean values to categorical data. The _coerce_to_type function is used to convert datetime/timedelta types to numeric so that the cut method can handle them. Therefore, the bug is likely located in the _coerce_to_type function where the conversion to numeric is happening incorrectly.

The bug occurred because the conversion of datetime/timedelta types to numeric was not handled properly, leading to the casting of boolean values to float64 during the qcut operation.

To fix the bug, the _coerce_to_type function needs to be modified to correctly handle the conversion of datetime/timedelta types to numeric.

Here's the corrected code for the _coerce_to_type function:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
        x = x.astype(np.int64)  # convert to numeric
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
        x = x.astype(np.int64)  # convert to numeric
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
        x = x.astype(np.int64)  # convert to numeric

    return x, dtype
```

In the corrected code, I have added explicit conversions to numeric (np.int64) for datetime/timedelta types, which should resolve the bug related to the TypeError in the qcut operation.
