The error message from the test function indicates that the qcut function is raising a TypeError due to issues with boolean values during slicing and interpolation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the _coerce_to_type method. Specifically, the issue appears to be with the coercion of boolean values to integers.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that boolean values are being coerced to integers using mathematical operations that are not supported for boolean values in the context of slicing and interpolation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle boolean values separately and avoid using unsupported mathematical operations on them. Instead, conditional logic can be used to handle the coercion of boolean values to integers.

Here's the corrected code for the _coerce_to_type method:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'bool':
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

This corrected code adds a conditional check for boolean values and explicitly converts them to integers using the astype method to avoid the TypeError that was occurring.
