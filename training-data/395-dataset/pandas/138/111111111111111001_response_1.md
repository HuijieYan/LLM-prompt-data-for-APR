Looking at the error message from the test function, it seems that there is a TypeError occurring during the interpolation within the `qcut` function. The error is related to performing arithmetic operations on boolean values where normally numerical values are expected.

After analyzing the function `_coerce_to_type`, it seems that the function is trying to convert boolean values to numeric values using operations such as `x.notna()` which results in a boolean Series, and then trying to use these boolean Series for arithmetic operations.

To fix this issue, instead of coercing the boolean values to integers directly, you can convert the boolean Series to integers using the `astype` method. This will ensure that the boolean values are properly converted to integers and will avoid the TypeError during the arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series):
        if x.dtype == 'bool':
            x = x.astype(int)
            dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    return x, dtype
```
