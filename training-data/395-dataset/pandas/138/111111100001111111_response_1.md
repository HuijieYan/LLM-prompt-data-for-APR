The issue is with the `_coerce_to_type` function, which is intended to convert datetime/timedelta data to numeric so that the `cut` method can handle it. However, the function is not handling boolean data correctly, resulting in a TypeError when the `qcut` function is used with boolean data.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_coerce_to_type` function to handle boolean data correctly. This can be achieved by adding a new condition to check if the input data is of boolean type, and then converting it to numeric as necessary.

Here's the corrected `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    Convert the input data to a numeric type that can be handled by the cut method.
    """
    if isinstance(x, pd.Series):
        if x.dtype == 'bool':
            x = x.astype(int)
    return x
```

With this correction, the `qcut` function should now be able to handle boolean data without raising a TypeError.
