The error is occurring due to the use of boolean data in the `qcut` function. The `qcut` function is not able to handle boolean data and raises a TypeError when trying to perform arithmetic operations on the boolean values.

To fix this bug, the `_coerce_to_type` function needs to be modified to handle boolean data appropriately. It should first check if the input is a boolean type, and if so, it should convert it to a numeric type before proceeding with further operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif x.dtype == np.bool:
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

With this modification, the `_coerce_to_type` function will be able to handle boolean data appropriately and prevent the TypeError raised by the `qcut` function when dealing with boolean values.
