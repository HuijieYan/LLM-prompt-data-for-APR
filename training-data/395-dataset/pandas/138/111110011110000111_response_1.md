The error messages indicate that there is an issue with the data type conversion within the `qcut` function. It seems that the function `_coerce_to_type` is used to convert the data to a suitable type for processing within the `qcut` function. However, the current implementation has some issues with handling boolean data types, resulting in type conversion errors.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the conversion of boolean values to numeric values using arithmetic operations.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to handle boolean data types separately and perform conversion to an appropriate numeric type without using arithmetic operations.
2. Ensure that the dtype is correctly identified and used for conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas.api.types as ptypes

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    if ptypes.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif ptypes.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif ptypes.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif ptypes.is_bool_dtype(x):
        x = x.astype('int64')  # Convert boolean to int64
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")
    else:
        dtype = None

    return x, dtype
```

In the corrected code:
- We have added a check for boolean data type using `ptypes.is_bool_dtype(x)`.
- If the data is boolean, we directly convert it to `int64` using `astype('int64')`.
- For other data types, the conversion logic remains the same as before.

By making these changes, the function should now be able to correctly handle boolean data type and perform appropriate type conversion without raising errors.
