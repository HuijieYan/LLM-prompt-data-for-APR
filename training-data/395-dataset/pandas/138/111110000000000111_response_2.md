The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting from one dtype to another, specifically from 'float64' to 'bool'. This likely means that the input data is being coerced to a data type that is not compatible with qcut.

The potential error location within the provided function is the process of coercing datetime/timedelta types to numeric types. It seems that the dtype conversion might be causing issues with the subsequent processing of the data.

The Bug: The function _coerce_to_type is attempting to convert datetime and timedelta data to a numeric format, but it is not handling the conversion properly, leading to errors when the data is used in other operations, such as qcut.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the input data is of datetime or timedelta type.
2. If it is, convert it to numeric so that it can be properly handled by other methods like qcut.
3. Handle the dtype conversion carefully to avoid any incompatible conversions that might lead to errors.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeTZDtype):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeDtype):
        x = x.astype(np.int64)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif isinstance(x, pd.TimedeltaDtype):
        x = x.astype(np.int64)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    return x, dtype
```
