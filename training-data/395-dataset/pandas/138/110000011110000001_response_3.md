The error message suggests that there is a problem with the subtraction operation involving boolean values. This is likely happening within the `qcut` function, specifically in the `_interpolate` method of `pandas/core/algorithms.py`, where it tries to perform a subtraction operation on boolean values.

The issue is occurring because the `data_result` variable contains boolean values (True/False) and when the `qcut` function tries to perform arithmetic operations on these boolean values, it results in a TypeError.

To fix this issue, the `_coerce_to_type` method should be updated to properly handle boolean values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` method:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif isinstance(x, bool):
        # Convert boolean values to 0/1
        x = int(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

This updated method includes a check for boolean values and converts them into integer values (0 for False and 1 for True), so that the `qcut` function can handle them properly without raising a TypeError.
