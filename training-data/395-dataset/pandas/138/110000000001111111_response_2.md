The issue with the provided function is that it is trying to coerce boolean values to numeric values using the np.int64 dtype, but this conversion is not valid. To fix this, we should explicitly check for boolean dtypes and avoid coercing them to numeric types.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]':
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'bool':
        # For boolean types, no coercion is necessary
        dtype = x.dtype
    else:  # For all other cases, cast to int64
        try:
            x = pd.to_numeric(x)
            dtype = np.dtype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    return x, dtype
```

This corrected function explicitly checks for boolean types, datetime types, and timedelta types before coercing to numeric values. If the input is a boolean type, it just returns the original input without any coercion. If the input is a datetime or timedelta type, it retains the original type. If the input is any other type, it tries to coerce it to int64 as before.
