The issue here is that the `qcut` function is raising a TypeError due to boolean data type inputs. The `qcut` function is internally using some numpy operations that do not support boolean data types.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_coerce_to_type` function to handle boolean data inputs. We can convert boolean inputs to numeric data so that the `qcut` function can handle it properly.

Here's the updated `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'bool':
        x = x.astype('int64')
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    return x, dtype
```

With this fix, the `_coerce_to_type` function will convert boolean inputs to numeric (int64) data types, allowing the `qcut` function to handle them properly.

This fix will resolve the TypeError that occurs when using boolean data type inputs with the `qcut` function.
