The issue with the `_coerce_to_type` function is that it requires the `np` and `is_datetime64tz_dtype` functions from the `numpy` and `pandas` libraries, which are not imported within the function. Additionally, the `to_datetime` and `to_timedelta` functions are also required, which are not defined in the code snippet provided.

To fix this, we need to import the necessary libraries at the beginning of the function:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that the cut method can handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

This code makes use of the correct library functions from `pandas` and `numpy` and also uses the correct syntax for accessing these functions.
