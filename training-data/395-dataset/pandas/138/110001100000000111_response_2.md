Potential error location: The issue seems to arise from the `dtype` variable, which is not being assigned properly in the `_coerce_to_type` function. This causes issues with type conversion and subsequent operations.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function `_coerce_to_type` is not handling the type conversion of datetime/timedelta types properly, resulting in incorrect dtype assignments and subsequent operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the type conversion of datetime/timedelta types in the function.
2. Ensure that the dtype is correctly assigned based on the input data.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notnull(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
