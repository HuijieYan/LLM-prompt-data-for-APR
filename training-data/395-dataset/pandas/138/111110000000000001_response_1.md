Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)` where the `np.where()` function is used to convert NaT to NaN during integer conversion.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect use of the `np.where()` function or the conditions being used to convert NaT to NaN.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Ensure that the conditions used in the `np.where()` function are correctly checking for NaT values and converting them to NaN during integer conversion.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # Convert NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(~pd.isnull(x), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
