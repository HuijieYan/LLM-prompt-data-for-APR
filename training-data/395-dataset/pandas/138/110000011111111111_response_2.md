The issue is a TypeError raised during the execution of the qcut function when it handles boolean Series as input. The error likely arises due to the numpy boolean operations that are used internally in the qcut function, which aren't compatible with direct arithmetic operations such as subtraction. The input data for the test case includes boolean Series, and when this data is passed to the qcut function, the TypeError is raised due to incompatible operations.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to convert the boolean Series to integers before passing them to the qcut function. This will ensure that the boolean data is properly handled without raising any TypeError related to incompatible operations.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    # Check if the input data is a boolean Series
    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'bool':
        x = x.astype(int)  # Convert boolean Series to integers
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")  # Set the dtype to integer
        
    return x, dtype
```

In this corrected function, we check if the input data is a boolean Series. If it is, we convert it to integers using the `astype` method and set the dtype to 'int64'.

This approach should resolve the TypeError issue with boolean Series data and ensure that the qcut function can handle the input without any errors.
