Potential error location: The line `x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)` may be causing the issue. `x.notna()` is being treated as a method, but it is actually an attribute that should be called as a method (`x.notna()`). 

Reasons behind the bug: The `notna` method of `x` is being called without the parentheses, so it is not executed as intended. This leads to incorrect behavior in the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Change `x.notna` to `x.notna()` to correctly call the method and obtain the expected behavior.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

Here, the code uses `pd.api.types` to call the methods `is_datetime64tz_dtype`, `is_datetime64_dtype`, and `is_timedelta64_dtype` to correctly check the data types. Additionally, `pd.to_datetime` and `pd.to_timedelta` are used to convert the data as needed. The `x.notna()` method is also properly called with parentheses.
