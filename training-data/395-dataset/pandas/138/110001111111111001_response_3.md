The error occurs in the `_interpolate` function of the `pandas/core/algorithms.py` file, specifically with the use of boolean values that are unsupported for the `-` operator. This occurs during the testing of the `qcut` function in the `pandas/core/reshape/tile.py` file.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `qcut` function expects numerical data, but when it receives boolean data as input, it tries to apply numerical operations on boolean values, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `_coerce_to_type` function within the `tile.py` module needs to be modified to handle the situation where the input data can be either boolean or integer type. The function should check the type of input and convert it to an appropriate numerical type before performing the operations. This ensures that the `qcut` function receives valid numerical data and prevents the error when it tries to perform operations on boolean values.

Here's the corrected `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    if isinstance(x, pd.Series):  # Check if input is a Series
        if x.dtype == 'bool':  # Convert boolean Series to integer type
            x = x.astype('int64')

    return x
```

With this modification, the `_coerce_to_type` function can handle both boolean and integer input, ensuring that the data passed to the `qcut` function is always numerical. This will prevent the error related to boolean subtraction and ensure smooth execution of the `qcut` function.
