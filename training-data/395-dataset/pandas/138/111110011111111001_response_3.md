The error message indicates that the bug is occurring in the `qcut` function where it is trying to perform a numpy boolean subtract operation which is not supported.

Given the error message, the bug is occurring at the point when `qcut` is trying to quantify the data in the `data_result` variable. The data in `data_result` is stored as an array or list of booleans and this is causing the error.

The bug is occurring because the `qcut` function expects numeric data but is receiving boolean values. This results in numpy boolean operations that are not supported in this context.

To fix the bug, the input data to the `qcut` function needs to be converted to numeric before applying the `qcut` function. The `_coerce_to_type` function can be modified to handle boolean values and convert them to numeric as well. Once the input is converted to numeric, the `qcut` function should work as intended.

Here's the corrected version of the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series):
        if pd.api.types.is_bool_dtype(x):
            x = x.astype('int64')  # Convert boolean to integer
            dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    return x, dtype
```

By checking if the input is a boolean type, and then converting it to integer if it is, we can ensure that the data is in a format that `qcut` can handle. This should resolve the issue.
