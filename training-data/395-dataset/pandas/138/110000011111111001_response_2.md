The error seems to be caused by the implementation of the `_coerce_to_type` function which is part of the code for the qcut function. The function `_coerce_to_type` is used to convert the input data type to a numeric type in a specific format. The error is likely caused by incorrect handling of boolean data types, leading to a TypeError during the execution of the qcut function.

To fix this issue, the `_coerce_to_type` function should handle boolean data types appropriately, converting them to their integer equivalent for further processing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_bool_dtype(x):
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

In the corrected version, the `is_bool_dtype` function from the `pd.api.types` module is used to check for boolean data types. If the input data is of boolean type, it is converted to an integer type using the `astype` method. The value of `dtype` is set accordingly to reflect the conversion.

This should resolve the issue and prevent the TypeError related to boolean data type subtraction during the execution of the qcut function.
