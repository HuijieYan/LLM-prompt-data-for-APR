The issue appears to be associated with the `qcut` function from the Pandas library, which is causing a TypeError when dealing with boolean Series input. The error message suggests issues with numpy boolean operations such as subtract. This may be due to the fact that qcut is attempting to perform operations on boolean Series that are not supported.

The reason for the bug is that the qcut function is not handling boolean Series input appropriately, leading to unsupported operations when trying to perform quantile calculations and interpolation.

To fix this bug, the qcut function needs to have proper handling for boolean Series input. It should handle boolean Series in a way that allows for the necessary calculations and operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == bool:
            x = x.astype(int)  # coerce boolean Series to int
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

This corrected function now includes a check for boolean Series and coerces them to integer values before further processing. This should address the TypeError caused by the unsupported operations with boolean Series input.
