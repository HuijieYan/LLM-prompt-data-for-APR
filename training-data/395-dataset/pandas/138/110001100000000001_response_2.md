Potential error location: The potential error in this function could be in the if-else conditions where it is trying to identify the type of the input 'x' and coercing it to a numeric type.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug could be occurring due to potential issues with the functions `is_datetime64tz_dtype`, `is_datetime64_dtype`, `is_timedelta64_dtype`, `to_datetime`, and `to_timedelta` which are being used to identify and coerce the input type.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fixing this bug could be to use the correct functions for identifying datetime and timedelta types and coercing them appropriately. Additionally, handling potential edge cases where the input type is not properly identified should also be taken into consideration.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None
    
    if isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif isinstance(x, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series):
        if issubclass(x.dtype.type, np.datetime64):
            x = x.astype('int64')
            dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
        elif issubclass(x.dtype.type, np.timedelta64):
            x = x.astype('int64')
            dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    return x, dtype
```
