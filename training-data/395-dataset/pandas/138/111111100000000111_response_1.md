Potential error location: It seems that the issue is arising from the `dtype` variable not being handled correctly within the `_coerce_to_type` function. The error message suggests an issue with casting output from `float64` to `bool`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of data types, particularly when converting datetime/timedelta types to numeric. This is causing issues when the data is later used in calculations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The function should handle datetime and timedelta types more carefully, ensuring that the conversion to numeric does not lead to unexpected data type conflicts.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64tz_dtype, is_datetime64_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype
from pandas.core.tools.datetimes import to_datetime, to_timedelta

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # Force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
