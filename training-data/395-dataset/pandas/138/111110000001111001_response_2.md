The buggy function is attempting to convert input data of different types (datetime, timedelta) to numeric if needed. The function checks the type of the input and converts it to numeric using numpy's `np.where` method. However, there are several issues with the implementation.

The first problem is that the function uses several undefined methods and names such as `is_datetime64tz_dtype`, `is_datetime64_dtype`, `to_datetime`, `is_timedelta64_dtype`, and `to_timedelta`. It seems that these are custom methods that are not available in the provided code snippet. 

The second issue is that the function attempts to change the dtype of the input data but the return value includes both the modified data and the new dtype, which may not be the expected behavior.

To fix the function, we need to define the missing methods, and also re-implement the logic to properly handle converting datetime and timedelta data to numeric type as per the requirements.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]':
        x = x.astype(np.int64)
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]':
        x = x.astype(np.int64)
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        x = x.astype(np.int64)
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')

    return x, dtype
```

In this updated version, we use `isinstance` to check if the input is a pandas Series and then check the specific dtype. We use `astype` to convert the Series to the desired type and update the `dtype` variable accordingly. This should properly handle the conversion for datetime and timedelta types.
