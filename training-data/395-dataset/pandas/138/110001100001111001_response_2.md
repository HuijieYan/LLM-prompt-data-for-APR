Potential Error Location: The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the `np.where()` function. There is a mismatch in the usage of the `np.where()` function, resulting in the TypeError.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the `np.where()` function is used with incorrect arguments. It is supposed to replace values where the condition is True with values from the first array and where it is False with values from the second array. However, in this case, the function incorrectly uses `x.notna()` as the condition, which results in a TypeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The `np.where()` function should be used with correct arguments, and the condition should be appropriately specified to avoid the TypeError.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # Force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(~np.isnan(x), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
