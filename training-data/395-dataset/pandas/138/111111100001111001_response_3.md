The issue with the `_coerce_to_type` function is that it is trying to access methods that do not exist or are not being used properly. The function is attempting to call methods like `notna` and `view` on the input variable `x`, which are not valid methods for the variable types being used.

In the current implementation, there is incorrect usage of methods like `notna` and `view` on the input variables, which is causing the function to fail.

The correct approach would be to check the type of the input variable and use appropriate methods that are available for that type.

Below is the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]':
        dtype = x.dtype
        x = x.dt.strftime('%s').astype('int64')
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
        dtype = x.dtype
        x = x.dt.total_seconds().astype('int64')

    return x, dtype
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the methods called are appropriate for the type of variable being used. We use `dt.strftime` and `dt.total_seconds` methods to convert datetime and timedelta types to numeric types, respectively.
