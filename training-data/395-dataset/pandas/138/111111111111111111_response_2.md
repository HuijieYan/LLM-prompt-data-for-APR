Issues were encountered when passing a boolean series to the `qcut` function in pandas. The errors indicate that boolean operations, such as subtract, were being attempted on the boolean data type.

The reason for these errors is that the `qcut` function tries to perform mathematical operations on the boolean values, which should not be the case. This leads to the TypeError: "numpy boolean subtract, the `-` operator, is not supported".

A potential approach to fix this bug would be to explicitly coerce the boolean series to an integer or float series before passing it to the `qcut` function. This can be achieved using the `.astype` method of the pandas Series.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'bool':
        # Coerce boolean to integer
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

This corrected code includes a specific check for boolean Series and coerces them to integer using the `.astype` method before further processing by the function.
