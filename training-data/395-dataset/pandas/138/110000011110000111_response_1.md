The problem seems to stem from the `qcut` function of the Pandas library, more specifically from the interaction between `qcut` and boolean Series. The provided error messages indicate that there are issues related to type conversion, multiplication, and interpolation.

There may be multiple factors contributing to this bug:
- Incorrect type conversions when handling boolean Series data.
- Improper handling of boolean data during the quantile calculation process.

To fix this bug, the following changes can be made to the `_coerce_to_type` function, which prepares the data for the `qcut` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype.name == 'bool':
        # Convert boolean Series to integers (0 and 1)
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = np.dtype("int")
    elif is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

In the fixed code, we added a check to see if the input data is a Series of boolean values. If it is, we convert the boolean values to integers (0 and 1) using the `astype` method. This conversion resolves the errors related to type conversions, multiplication, and interpolation.

After making these changes, we can rerun the test cases to ensure that the bug has been fixed. If the test cases pass without any errors, it indicates that the fix has been successful.
