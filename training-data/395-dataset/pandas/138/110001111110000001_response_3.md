The error message states "TypeError: numpy boolean subtract, the `-` operator, is not supported, use the bitwise_xor, the `^` operator, or the logical_xor function instead." This suggests that there is an issue with the subtraction operation involving boolean values ("True" and "False").

Looking at the `qcut` function, it seems that the error is happening during the interpolation step for calculating the quantiles. The `_interpolate` function, used for interpolation, is performing a subtraction operation on boolean values which is not supported.

To fix this bug, the `_coerce_to_type` function needs to be updated to handle the conversion of boolean values. It should not perform any conversion for boolean values and should simply return the original boolean array. Let's also handle the case for float and integer values.

Below is the corrected code for the `coerce_to_type` function:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    Coerce the input array to a specific type if needed.
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    convert it to numeric so that the cut method can handle it
    """
    if is_bool_dtype(x):
        # No conversion needed for boolean values
        return x, None
    elif is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif is_numeric_dtype(x):
        # No conversion needed for numeric types
        return x, None

    if dtype is not None:
        # Force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

This updated function first checks if the input data is a boolean array and returns it as is, without performing any conversion. If the input is datetime, timedelta, or numeric type, it performs the necessary conversion as before.
