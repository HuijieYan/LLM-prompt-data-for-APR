Based on the provided error messages from the test function and the associated issue description, it seems that the `qcut` function is raising a TypeError due to the presence of boolean values in the input Series/array. 

The error message indicates that there are issues related to the ufunc operations involving boolean values, specifically multiplication and subtraction. These operations are not supported for boolean data types in numpy.

In the `qcut` function, the error occurs due to the usage of quantile calculation and interpolation, where the boolean data type is causing issues with the arithmetic operations.

To fix this bug, the `qcut` function needs to handle boolean input values appropriately. A possible approach for fixing the bug is to preprocess the input data and convert boolean values to integers before performing quantile calculations and interpolation.

Below is the corrected code for the `qcut` function which includes handling of boolean input values:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif x.dtype == 'bool':
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

In this corrected code, boolean input values are handled separately. If the data type of input `x` is boolean, it is first converted to integer type using `astype(int)` before further operations.

This correction will ensure that boolean values in the input are appropriately handled, avoiding the TypeError related to boolean arithmetic operations.
