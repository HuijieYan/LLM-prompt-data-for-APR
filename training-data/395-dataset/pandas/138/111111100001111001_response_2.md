The given function is not performing as expected. The function `_coerce_to_type` is intended to convert datetime or timedelta data to numeric so that the `cut` method can handle it, but it fails to do so. The function is not written properly to handle different data types and coerce them accordingly.

One potential reason for the bug is that the function does not check whether the input is a Series or a NumPy array, and as a result, trying to access methods specific to a Series can cause errors when the input is actually a NumPy array.

To fix this issue, the function needs to first check the type of the input data (Series or NumPy array) and handle each case differently. If the input is a Series, appropriate Series methods should be used. If the input is a NumPy array, NumPy functions should be used instead.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series):
        if x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]':
            dtype = x.dtype
            x = x.dt.to_numeric()
        elif x.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            dtype = x.dtype
            x = x.dt.to_numeric()
    elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray):
        if x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]':
            dtype = x.dtype
            x = pd.to_numeric(x)
        elif x.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            dtype = x.dtype
            x = pd.to_numeric(x)

    return x, dtype
```

In the corrected function, it first checks the type of the input data and then uses the appropriate methods to convert datetime or timedelta data to numeric. This ensures that the function is able to handle both Series and NumPy arrays correctly.
