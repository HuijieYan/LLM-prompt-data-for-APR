The issue with the provided function is that it tries to infer the dtype of the Index object based on the data, which can lead to unexpected behavior. For instance, even if a dtype is specified, the function might ignore it and use a different dtype based on the data.

To fix this issue, the Index constructor should prioritize the specified dtype over inferring the dtype from the data. Additionally, the function should avoid inferring the dtype from the data when `dtype=object` is specified, as this should disable all inference.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":

    # other code...
    
    if dtype == object:
        # Disable all inference and use the specified dtype
        return Index(np.asarray(data), dtype=object, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
    
    # prioritize the specified dtype over inferring the dtype from the data
    return Index(np.asarray(data, dtype=dtype), dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
```

This corrected function ensures that the specified dtype is enforced, and the behavior of inferring the dtype from the data is disabled when `dtype=object` is specified.
