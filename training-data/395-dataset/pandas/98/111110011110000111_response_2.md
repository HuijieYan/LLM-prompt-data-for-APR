The test case is trying to create an Index with a specified dtype, but the output is not as expected. The error message indicates that the Index is of dtype 'object' instead of the specified 'period[D]'. This suggests that the function for creating the Index does not enforce the specified dtype.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where data type inference occurs. The function infers the data type based on the input data, which leads to the mismatch with the specified dtype.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code infers the dtype based on the input data, which can override the specified dtype. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect dtype in the output.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to enforce the specified dtype, overriding any inference based on the input data. The dtype provided as input should be used explicitly without any inference based on the data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs
):
    from pandas import PeriodIndex

    if dtype is not None:
        # Ensure that the specified dtype is enforced
        inferred_dtype = None
    else:
        inferred_dtype = infer_dtype_based_on_data(data)
        dtype = inferred_dtype

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged with the use of 'dtype' instead of 'inferred_dtype'

```
