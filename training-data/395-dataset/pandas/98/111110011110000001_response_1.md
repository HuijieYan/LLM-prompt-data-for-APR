The test case `test_base_constructor_with_period_dtype` is attempting to create a pandas Index with values that are Periods. However, the expected result is to create a `PeriodIndex` because the values are of type Period. The error message indicates that the classes of the left and right operands are different, which is the cause of the failure.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__new__` method. This method is used to create a new instance of the class, which in this case is the Index class. It contains logic to infer the correct type of Index based on the input data and its properties.

The error occurred because the `__new__` method did not properly handle the creation of a `PeriodIndex` when the input data contains period values. Instead, it created a regular `Index` with dtype 'object'.

To fix this bug, the logic inside the `__new__` method should be modified to correctly identify when the input data contains period values and then create a `PeriodIndex` accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(
        cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs
    ) -> "Index":

    # ... (omitted code)

    if is_period_dtype(data) or is_period_dtype(dtype):
        return PeriodIndex(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)

    # ... (remaining logic for other types of data)
```

In the corrected code, an additional check for period dtype is added before handling other types of data. This check ensures that when the input data contains period values, the correct Index type, `PeriodIndex`, is created.
