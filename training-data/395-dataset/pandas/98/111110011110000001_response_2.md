The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the creation of a new Index with a Period dtype. The test case `test_base_constructor_with_period_dtype` expects a result of type `PeriodIndex`, but the actual result is of type `Index` with dtype 'object'. This indicates that the function is not correctly handling the creation of an Index with Period dtype.

It appears that the function is not correctly identifying the input data as having a Period dtype, and therefore, it is not creating a PeriodIndex as expected.

To fix this bug, the function `__new__` needs to be modified to properly handle the creation of an Index with a Period dtype. This likely involves identifying the dtype of the input values and creating a PeriodIndex if the dtype is 'period[D]'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs
) -> "Index":
    if dtype is not None and isinstance(dtype, PeriodDtype):
        return pd.PeriodIndex(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
    else:
        # Rest of the function remains the same
        pass
```

By checking if the input `dtype` is an instance of `PeriodDtype`, the correct Index type can be returned based on the dtype. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function handles the creation of an Index with a Period dtype appropriately.
