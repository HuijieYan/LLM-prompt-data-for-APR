The test case `test_base_constructor_with_period_dtype` attempts to create an Index with specified dtype 'D' for periods from a list of date strings. However, the output Index has a dtype of 'object' instead of 'period[D]'.

Based on the error message, the issue seems to be related to the type inference within the `__new__` method, which is incorrectly inferring the dtype of the output Index.

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method infers the dtype of the output Index based on the input data, which results in the incorrect dtype being assigned to the Index.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `__new__` method to enforce the specified dtype if it is provided.
2. If no dtype is provided, the method should continue to infer the dtype based on the input data.
3. Ensure that the dtype inference mechanism considers the input data type and enforces the specified dtype if provided.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":
    # existing code

    # existing imports

    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if dtype is not None:
        # If dtype is specified, enforce it
        return Index(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)

    # remaining type inference based on data
    # ... (existing code)

```

With this revised implementation, the `__new__` method will check for the specified dtype and directly enforce it for the output Index. If no dtype is specified, the method will continue to infer the dtype based on the input data.
