The error is likely occurring within the __new__ method of the Index class. The issue seems to be related to the dtype inference during the construction of an Index object. Depending on the type of data passed to the constructor, the resulting Index object may have a different dtype than the one specified in the constructor arguments.

To fix this bug, the dtype inference logic needs to be modified to adhere to the specified dtype. Additionally, the possibility of disabling all inference by specifying dtype=object should be considered.

Here's the corrected code for the __new__ method of the Index class:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":

    # ... omitted code ...

    # Check if dtype is explicitly specified and disable inference if dtype=object
    if dtype == object:
        return Index(data, dtype=object, copy=copy, name=name, tupleize_cols=tupleize_cols, **kwargs)

    # Rest of the original inference logic remains the same
    # ...

    # Add a final fallback for creating an Index object if data does not match any specific type
    # Other iterable of some kind
    subarr = com.asarray_tuplesafe(data, dtype=object)
    return Index(subarr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, tupleize_cols=tupleize_cols, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the dtype is explicitly set to object. If so, we directly create an Index object without any inference. Otherwise, the original dtype inference logic is retained. This change ensures that the specified dtype is enforced during the construction of the Index object.
