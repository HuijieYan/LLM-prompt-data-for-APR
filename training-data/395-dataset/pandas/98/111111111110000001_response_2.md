Based on the error message, it seems that the test case is expecting the result to be a `PeriodIndex`, but the actual result is an `Index` with dtype 'object'. This suggests that the bug is likely in the function __new__ in the Index class, specifically in the section where it handles `PeriodIndex`.

The bug may be occurring because the function __new__ may not be correctly checking for the dtype being a PeriodDtype and creating a PeriodIndex accordingly. It seems that the logic for creating a PeriodIndex is missing or incorrect.

To fix the bug, the section of the __new__ function that handles `PeriodIndex` creation needs to be revised to correctly identify and create a PeriodIndex when the dtype is a PeriodDtype. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs
) -> "Index":
    from pandas import PeriodIndex

    if dtype is not None and dtype.type is PeriodDtype:
        return PeriodIndex(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
