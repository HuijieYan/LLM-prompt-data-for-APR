The error message indicates that the `pd.Index` constructor is not enforcing the specified dtype and is silently outputting a different dtype than the one specified, which is `PeriodDtype("D")`. This is causing a mismatch in the expected and actual output, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location within the problematic function (`__new__` method of the `Index` class) is likely the place where the dtype is not being enforced based on the input data.

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method is inferring the dtype from the input data rather than enforcing the specified dtype. This behavior is not consistent with the expectation of the test case and can lead to unexpected outputs.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__new__` method to enforce the specified dtype instead of inferring it from the input data. This can be achieved by explicitly checking and casting the input data to the specified dtype, ensuring that the output dtype matches the specified dtype.

Here is the corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `Index` class:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":

    # previous code remains unchanged

    # check if dtype is specified and enforce it
    if dtype is not None:
        if isinstance(data, ABCPandasArray):
            # ensure users don't accidentally put a PandasArray in an index.
            data = data.to_numpy()

        if isinstance(data, (np.ndarray, Index, ABCSeries)):
            # if data is an array or Index, explicitly cast it to the specified dtype
            data = data.astype(dtype)

        # update the dtype parameter if necessary
        dtype = data.dtype

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the `__new__` method will explicitly enforce the specified dtype, ensuring that the output dtype matches the specified dtype, and the bug should be fixed.
