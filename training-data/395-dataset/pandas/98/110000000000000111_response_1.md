The issue seems to be related to the `Index` constructor's inference of the output dtype from the data passed to it. The problem arises when specifying a dtype and it not being enforced. 

The potential error location within the code is likely the conditional blocks where the dtype is assigned or checked. It seems that there is inconsistency in enforcing the specified dtype when constructing the `Index`.

The issue occurs because the code infers the dtype based on the data passed to the `Index` constructor, ignoring the dtype parameter passed explicitly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic of the function to enforce the specified dtype regardless of the data inference.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":

    # Existing code

    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    if dtype is not None:
        kwargs['dtype'] = dtype  # Enforce the specified dtype
        
    # Existing code

    return Index(data, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)  # Return the Index with the updated dtype
```
