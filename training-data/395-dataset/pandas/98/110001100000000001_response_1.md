The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `cls` variable without proper initialization. It seems that the function is trying to create an Index object from different data types, but the `cls` variable is being used without being defined.

The bug occurs because the `cls` variable is not properly defined or passed to the function when calling it. This leads to an error when trying to create a new Index object because the class is not specified.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to include the `cls` variable as a parameter in the function definition, and it should be properly passed when calling the function. Additionally, it's important to determine whether the `cls` variable should be used as a parameter or obtained from another source within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":
    from .range import RangeIndex
    from pandas import PeriodIndex, DatetimeIndex, TimedeltaIndex
    from .numeric import Float64Index, Int64Index, UInt64Index
    from .interval import IntervalIndex
    from .category import CategoricalIndex

    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
