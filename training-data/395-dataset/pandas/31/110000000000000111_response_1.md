The error occurs when the `df.groupby("a")["b"].quantile(0.5)` method is called. This error is related to quantile calculation with nullable integers.

The bug seems to be in the `pre_processor` function. It is throwing a TypeError when trying to perform 'quantile' against 'object' dtypes.

The reason for this bug might be that the function is not handling nullable integers properly.

To fix the bug, we need to handle nullable integers separately in the pre-processor function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    from pandas import concat
    from typing import Tuple, Optional, Type

    def pre_processor(vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        if is_object_dtype(vals) or is_array_like(vals) and pd.api.types.is_nullable(vals):
            raise TypeError(
                "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' or nullable dtypes!"
            )

        inference = None
        if is_integer_dtype(vals):
            if pd.api.types.is_nullable(vals):
                inference = 'Int64'
            else:
                inference = np.int64
            vals = pd.array(vals).astype('float64')
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(vals):
            inference = "datetime64[ns]"
            vals = np.asarray(vals).astype(np.float)

        return vals, inference

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```
