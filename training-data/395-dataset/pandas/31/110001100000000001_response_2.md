The bug is in the quantile method of the GroupBy class. The error is likely to occur due to incorrect handling of the quantile calculation when the 'q' parameter is not a scalar (i.e., an array-like).

The code currently checks if 'q' is a scalar and returns the result using _get_cythonized_result with the specified parameters. However, when 'q' is not a scalar, the code calculates the result for each value in 'q' and then concatenates the results. In the process, it uses index manipulation which is likely leading to an error.

To fix this bug, the correct approach is to separate the code for handling scalar and array-like 'q' parameters. When 'q' is not a scalar, each quantile value should be processed separately, and the index manipulation should be handled more accurately.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    from pandas import concat

    def pre_processor(vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        if is_object_dtype(vals):
            raise TypeError(
                "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!"
            )

        inference = None
        if is_integer_dtype(vals):
            inference = np.int64
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(vals):
            inference = "datetime64[ns]"
            vals = np.asarray(vals).astype(np.float)

        return vals, inference

    def post_processor(vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        if inference:
            if not (is_integer_dtype(inference) and interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}):
                vals = vals.astype(inference)

        return vals

    if is_scalar(q):
        return self._get_cythonized_result(
            "group_quantile",
            aggregate=True,
            needs_values=True,
            needs_mask=True,
            cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
            pre_processing=pre_processor,
            post_processing=post_processor,
            q=q,
            interpolation=interpolation,
        )
    else:
        results = []
        for qi in q:
            qi_result = self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=pre_processor,
                post_processing=post_processor,
                q=qi,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
            results.append(qi_result)
        result = concat(results, axis=0)

        return result
```
In the corrected code, when 'q' is not a scalar, each quantile value is processed separately and the result is stored in the 'results' list. Then, the 'result' is obtained by concatenating the 'results' list along the axis 0. This approach ensures that index manipulation issues are avoided.
