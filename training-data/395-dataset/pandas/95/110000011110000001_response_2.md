The test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed` is comparing a `PeriodIndex` object `idx` with different types of `other` values including an integer `2017`.
The error message states that the numpy array values are different. The comparison result `result` is calculated as `[True, True, False]` while the expected result is `[False, False, False]`. 

The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the comparison operation for an integer value.

The bug occurred because the original function was not treating integers as Periods, whereas the test case expected integers to be treated as Periods. This discrepancy caused the incorrect comparison result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of integer comparison. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling integer comparisons within the `wrapper` function in the `_period_array_cmp` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` method:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # treat integer as Period
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)
            return result

        # rest of the code unchanged
        # ...

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
``` 

By treating integers as Periods and creating a Period object for comparison, this corrected code should resolve the bug observed in the test case.
