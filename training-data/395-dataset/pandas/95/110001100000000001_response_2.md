The potential error in the given function is the improper handling of comparison operations for Period-like objects. The function is trying to compare two Period-like objects using a variety of conditions and checks, but the implementation is complex and prone to errors.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to handle too many cases and conditions in a single function, leading to confusion and potential errors in the logic.

To fix the bug, the function should be refactored to handle each case separately in a more organized and straightforward manner. The conditions for comparing Period-like objects should be simplified and clearly defined to avoid ambiguity.

Here is the corrected code for the _period_array_cmp function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, str):
            other = self._scalar_from_string(other)  # Convert string to Period
        elif isinstance(other, (int, np.int64)):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)  # Convert int to Period
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported comparison type")
        
        result = getattr(self.asi8, opname)(other.asi8)  # Perform the comparison
        
        return result
    
    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, the function has been simplified to handle only two cases - comparing a Period-like object to a string and comparing a Period-like object to an integer. All other cases have been explicitly raised as unsupported, simplifying the logic and making it easier to understand and maintain.
