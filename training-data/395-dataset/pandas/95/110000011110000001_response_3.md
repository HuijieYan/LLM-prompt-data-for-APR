1. The test case is testing the equality comparison of a `PeriodIndex` with various types of data, including integers, arrays, and `pd.Index`. The expected output is an array of boolean values. 

2. The issue seems to be related to how the `PeriodIndex` is handling the comparison with integers. 

3. The bug appears to be related to the comparison of the `PeriodIndex` with integers and arrays. The error message indicates that the numpy array values are different, and the assertion fails for the test case where `other = 2017`. This suggests that the comparison with an integer value is not producing the expected boolean array.

4. To fix the bug, the code within the `wrapper` function needs to be adjusted to handle the comparison with integer values accurately.

5. Corrected function/method:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        # Comparison with integer
        if isinstance(other, int):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)
        
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```
