The error occurs in the `test_eq_integer_disallowed` test function. The test is comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer value '2017'. The code is expected to raise a `TypeError` when comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer. However, the actual result is an array of boolean values, which is unexpected.

The issue is likely in the `_period_array_cmp` function. It appears that the comparison is not being handled correctly for the case when `other` is an integer. The function should raise a `TypeError` in this case, but it is not doing so.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly handling the comparison operations for the `Period` type and other data types like integers.

To fix this bug, the comparison operations in the `_period_array_cmp` function need to be modified. The function should raise a `TypeError` when `other` is an integer, as is indicated in the test case.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            # Raise TypeError for comparison with integers
            raise TypeError("Comparison with integers is not allowed")

        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        # rest of the code for handling different comparison types...

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In this corrected implementation, if `other` is an integer, the function will raise a `TypeError` as expected.

After making this change, the `_period_array_cmp` function should handle the integer comparison correctly and pass the test cases without errors.
