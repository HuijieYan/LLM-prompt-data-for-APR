The bug is likely occurring in the `_period_array_cmp` function, specifically in the inner `wrapper` function where the comparison operations are handled. The error message from the test function indicates that when comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer (2017), the comparison operation is returning an array with unexpected values which is causing the assertion error.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison operations in the `wrapper` function are not handling integer comparison cases properly. The comparison logic is expecting `other` to be a Period-like object, and when it's an integer, the logic is not handling it correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `wrapper` function to properly handle the case when `other` is an integer.

Below is the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        if isinstance(other, (int, Period)):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)
        else:
            return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the case when `other` is an integer by creating a `Period` object from it and then performing the comparison operation.

With this fix, the comparison logic in the `wrapper` function should handle the case of comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer correctly, resolving the issue observed in the test function.
