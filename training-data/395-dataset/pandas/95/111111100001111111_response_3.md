Based on the provided code and input parameters, it seems that the issue lies within the `_period_array_cmp` function. The function is attempting to wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype. However, there are multiple bugs within the function.

The primary issues with the function include redundancy in processing the `opname` and incorrect comparisons. Additionally, the use of uninitialized variables such as `class._is_recognized_dtype` and the absence of variable definitions such as `_recognized_scalars` are causing potential errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be refactored to correctly handle comparisons with Period-like objects and strings:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, (int, np.integer)):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = getattr(self.asi8, opname)(other.ordinal)
        else:
            if isinstance(other, (cls, Period, NaTType)):
                self._check_compatible_with(other)
                other_i8 = self._unbox_scalar(other)
                result = getattr(self.view("i8"), opname)(other_i8)
                if isna(other):
                    result.fill(nat_result)
            else:
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In this corrected code, the function appropriately checks for string and integer comparisons, and handles them accordingly. Additionally, it ensures that the `nat_result` is correctly set for the `__ne__` operation. Also, it correctly handles the `self._hasnans` condition at the end of the function.
