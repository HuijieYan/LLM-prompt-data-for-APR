Based on the provided code, the potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `compat.set_function_name` method. The code attempts to wrap the comparison operations for Period-like objects, but due to the complex nature of the function, it seems like it's prone to multiple errors.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug may include:
1. Incorrect usage of the `compat.set_function_name` method.
2. Ambiguity in handling different data types and comparisons.
3. Lack of error handling for certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Simplify the function to only handle the wrapping of comparison operations for Period-like objects without involving complex datatype handling.
2. Add explicit error handling for different data types and comparison scenarios to avoid unexpected behavior.
3. Use built-in pandas functions for comparison operations instead of re-implementing them in a complex manner.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    def wrapper(self, other):
        result = self.astype(object).__array_ufunc__(op, other.astype(object), cls)
        return result

    return wrapper
```
