The test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed` compares a `PeriodIndex` object `idx` with an integer `2017`. Based on the expected behavior, the comparison should raise a `TypeError` exception for all comparison operations (`==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).

The error message indicates that the comparison using the `==` operator did not raise a `TypeError` as expected. Instead, it produced an array with unexpected values `[True, True, False]`, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `_period_array_cmp` function is the comparison logic inside the `wrapper` function. The `wrapper` function handles the comparison operations and determines the result of the comparison between the `PeriodIndex` object and the provided `other` value.

The bug occurred because the comparison logic inside the `wrapper` function did not correctly handle the case when an integer value is provided as `other`. It did not raise a `TypeError` as expected, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic inside the `wrapper` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when an integer value is provided. It should raise a `TypeError` for comparison operations involving integers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            raise TypeError("Comparison operations with integers not allowed")

        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        # Remaining comparison logic...
        # (rest of the existing code)

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, the `wrapper` function now includes a check to raise a `TypeError` if the `other` value is an integer. This ensures that comparison operations with integers are disallowed, as expected by the `test_eq_integer_disallowed` test case.
