The error message indicates that the comparison operation using the '==' operator between the PeriodIndex 'idx' and the integer 'other' is producing an incorrect result. This suggests that the comparison operation in the function '_period_array_cmp' is not working as intended.

The potential error location in the code is within the 'wrapper' function, specifically the handling of comparison between the 'self' (PeriodIndex) and 'other' (which can be an integer or other data types).

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the comparison between the PeriodIndex and an integer correctly. The comparison operation should ideally raise a TypeError when comparing PeriodIndex with an integer, but it seems to be producing incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the comparison operation should be modified to check the data type of 'other' and handle the comparison accordingly. If 'other' is an integer or other non-Period data types, it should raise a TypeError. If 'other' is an array or other supported data types, the comparison should be performed accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function '_period_array_cmp':

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, (int, np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
            raise TypeError("Comparison with non-Period data types is not supported")

        if isinstance(other, int):
            # Comparison with integer is not supported
            raise TypeError("Comparison with integer is not supported")

        # Rest of the comparison logic goes here...
        
    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```
