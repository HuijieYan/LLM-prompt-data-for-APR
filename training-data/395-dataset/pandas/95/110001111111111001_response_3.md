The test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed` is testing the behavior of comparing a `PeriodIndex` with integers and other data types. The test is expecting that comparing the `PeriodIndex` with integers will raise a `TypeError`, and it's also comparing the `PeriodIndex` with an integer array to check the behavior.

The error message shows that the numpy array comparison `tm.assert_numpy_array_equal(result, expected)` is failing because the expected array does not match the actual result array. The expected array is `[False, False, False]`, but the actual result array is `[True, True, False]`.

The bug occurs in the `_period_array_cmp` function because the comparison operations are not being handled correctly for the `PeriodArray` class.

The reason for this bug is that the comparison operation for integers is not being treated as disallowed, as indicated by the test case and the related error message.

To fix this bug, the comparison operation for integers should be explicitly disallowed for the `PeriodArray` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            raise TypeError("Comparison between PeriodArray and integer is not allowed")

        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
    
    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, an explicit check is added to raise a `TypeError` if the comparison is between a `PeriodArray` and an integer. This change aligns with the expectations set in the `test_eq_integer_disallowed` test case and ensures that the comparison behavior for `PeriodArray` is handled correctly.
