The test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed` is testing the behavior of comparing a `PeriodIndex` object with various types of `other` objects, including integers and arrays. The specific assertion causing the failure is `tm.assert_numpy_array_equal(result, expected)`, indicating that the result of the comparison is not as expected.

The potential error within the `wrapper` function is handling the comparison operations for the `PeriodArray` class. It appears that there might be a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior when comparing a `PeriodIndex` object with an integer. The error message in the test function suggests that the result of the comparison is not as expected, leading to an assertion failure.

The bug might be occurring due to incorrect handling of comparisons with integers in the `wrapper` function. It appears that the function is not correctly distinguishing between comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer and comparing it with other types of objects. This is likely the reason for the unexpected behavior in the comparison operations.

To fix the bug, the `wrapper` function needs to be modified to handle comparisons with integers specifically. This modification should ensure that comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer results in the correct behavior as per the expected semantics.

Here's the corrected `wrapper` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

        # Rest of the existing code for handling comparisons with other types

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In this corrected code, when `other` is an integer, it is converted to a `Period` object before performing the comparison. This ensures that the behavior of comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer aligns with the expected semantics.
