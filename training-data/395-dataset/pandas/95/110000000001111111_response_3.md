The function appears to be creating a wrapper function for comparison operations on Period-like objects. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect assignment of the opname variable within the _period_array_cmp function. This variable is used to determine the comparison operation to be performed.

The bug occurs because the opname is being assigned the value of op.__name__ without the '__' on either ends, which is incorrect. This is causing the comparison operations to be performed incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the assignment of opname to include the '__' on both ends of op.__name__. This will ensure that the correct comparison operation is being performed.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"  # Corrected assignment of opname
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        # Rest of the function remains the same
        # ...

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```
