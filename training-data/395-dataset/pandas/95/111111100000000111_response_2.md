The potential error in the provided function is with the handling of comparison operations for Period-like objects. 

The bug seems to be occurring because the function is not explicitly handling all cases of comparison operations for Period-like objects, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix the bug, we need to:
- Ensure that all cases of comparison operations for Period-like objects are explicitly handled.
- Validate the input parameters to ensure that they are of the expected types and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

        self._check_compatible_with(other)

        if isna(other):
            result = np.full(len(self), nat_result)
        else:
            result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result
    
    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```
