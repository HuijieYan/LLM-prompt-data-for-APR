The problem originates from the function `_period_array_cmp`. This function compares period-like objects using the specified operation. The buggy code attempts to handle comparison with integers by converting them to periods and performing the comparison. However, it uses an incorrect approach to handle comparisons with integers, leading to the test failure.

The reason for the bug is that the function doesn't correctly handle comparisons with integers. When comparing PeriodIndex with integers, it should raise a TypeError, but the buggy function attempts to convert integers to periods and perform the comparison. This leads to incorrect results and the test failure.

To fix this, the function should be modified to correctly handle comparisons with integers and raise a TypeError in such cases, as specified in the test case.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_period_array_cmp` is as follows:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            raise TypeError("Comparison between PeriodIndex and integer is not allowed")

        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)
        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged) ...

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```
In this corrected code, an explicit check for integer types is added, and if the comparison is attempted between PeriodIndex and an integer, a TypeError is raised as specified in the test case.
