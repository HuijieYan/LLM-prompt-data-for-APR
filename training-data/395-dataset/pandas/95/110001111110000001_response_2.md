The error message is showing that the comparison between the PeriodIndex and integer `2017` is resulting in unexpected values in the result array. The expected result is `[False, False, False]` but the actual result is `[True, True, False]`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `_period_array_cmp` method, specifically in the comparison logic for the case when `other` is an integer.

The bug is occurring because when `other` is an integer, the logic in the _period_array_cmp method is not handling it properly, resulting in incorrect comparison results.

The bug can be fixed by adding specific handling for the case when `other` is an integer, ensuring that it is converted to a `Period` type and then compared with the PeriodIndex values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # Convert the integer to a Period type
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

        # ... rest of the comparison logic ...
      
    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```
