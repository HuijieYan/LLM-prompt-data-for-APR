The buggy function `_period_array_cmp` is designed to wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype. It takes an input `op` which is a comparison operation and creates a new function `wrapper` to handle the comparison.

The bug occurs because `@unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)` is used as a decorator for the `wrapper` function, but the `wrapper` function is already defined inside the `_period_array_cmp` function. This is causing a conflict and leading to the error.

To fix this bug, the decorator should be applied to a separate function `wrapper` rather than the `wrapper` function nested inside `_period_array_cmp`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    def wrapper(self, other):
        opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
        nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        # ... rest of the code remains the same ...

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, f'_{opname}', cls)
```

In the corrected code, the decorator `@unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)` has been removed, and `wrapper` is defined as a separate function inside the `_period_array_cmp` function. This should resolve the bug by removing the conflict and allowing the function to execute correctly.
