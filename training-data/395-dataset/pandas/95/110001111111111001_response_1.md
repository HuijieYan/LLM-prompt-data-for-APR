The error occurs in the `test_eq_integer_disallowed` test function, where the comparison operation (`idx == other`) fails to produce the expected result, leading to an assertion error. The test case expects `result` to be equal to `expected`, but this is not the case.

The bug in the `_period_array_cmp` function seems to be related to the comparison operations involving Period-like objects and integers. The function is supposed to wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like objects to PeriodDtype, but there seems to be an issue with the handling of integer inputs.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle integer inputs. When comparison operations involving integers and Period-like objects occur, the function fails to treat integers as Periods as per the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the comparison operations involving integers and Period-like objects properly. It should ensure that integers are not treated as Periods. This can be achieved by adjusting the conditional statements and data type checking within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, int):  # Check if other is not an integer
            ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

            if isinstance(other, str):
                try:
                    other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
                except ValueError:
                    # string that can't be parsed as Period
                    return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
            else:
                other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
                result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)

            if isinstance(other, self._recognized_scalars) or other is NaT:
                other = self._scalar_type(other)
                self._check_compatible_with(other)

                other_i8 = self._unbox_scalar(other)

                result = op(self.view("i8"), other_i8)
                if isna(other):
                    result.fill(nat_result)

            elif not is_list_like(other):
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

            elif len(other) != len(self):
                raise ValueError("Lengths must match")

            else:
                if isinstance(other, list):
                    other = np.array(other)

                if not isinstance(other, (np.ndarray, cls)):
                    return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

                if is_object_dtype(other):
                    with np.errstate(all="ignore"):
                        result = ops.comp_method_OBJECT_ARRAY(
                            op, self.astype(object), other
                        )
                    o_mask = isna(other)

                elif not cls._is_recognized_dtype(other.dtype):
                    return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

                else:
                    assert isinstance(other, cls), type(other)

                    self._check_compatible_with(other)

                    result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))
                    o_mask = other._isnan

                if o_mask.any():
                    result[o_mask] = nat_result

            if self._hasnans:
                result[self._isnan] = nat_result

            return result
        else:
            raise TypeError("Comparison operations between Period and integer not allowed")

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to ensure that if the `other` operand is an integer, a `TypeError` is raised indicating that comparison operations between Period and integers are not allowed. This addresses the issue of mistakenly treating integers as Periods and resolves the bug.
