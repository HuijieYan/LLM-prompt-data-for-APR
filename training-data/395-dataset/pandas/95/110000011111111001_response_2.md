The issue in the code is with the comparison operations like '==', '<', '>', '<=', '>='. The function _period_array_cmp is intended to compare Period-like objects but it currently has a bug that prevents proper comparison of PeriodIndex with integers.

The bug occurs in the wrapper function due to logic issues related to comparison with integers. When comparing a PeriodIndex with an integer, the previous implementation does not raise a TypeError as expected and returns an incorrect result. This is because the logic for comparison with the scalar 'other' is not handled properly.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling comparisons with scalar should be adjusted to correctly handle comparisons with integers. It should raise a TypeError for these comparisons in order to match Period semantics by not treating integers as Periods. 

The corrected code for the _period_array_cmp function is as follows:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            raise TypeError("Comparison with integers is not allowed")

        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        # Rest of the code remains the same

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In this corrected code, the comparison with integers is properly handled, and if the 'other' value is an integer, a TypeError will be raised as expected.
