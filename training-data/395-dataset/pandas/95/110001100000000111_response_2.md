Potential error location:
The potential error in the provided function is that the wrapper function is not correctly handling the comparison operations for Period-like objects. It seems to be converting Period-like objects to PeriodDtype, but there are logical and type-checking errors in the code.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. There are logical errors in handling different types of input for comparison operations.
2. Type-checking and conversion of Period-like objects are not consistent and may lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handle the different types of input for comparison operations, such as strings, integers, and arrays.
2. Ensure that type-checking is done correctly and consistently for Period-like objects and other data types.
3. Use appropriate type conversions and comparisons based on the input type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # Create Period object from the integer
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

        self._check_compatible_with(other)

        result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    setattr(cls, opname, wrapper)
```
