The bug in the given function seems to be related to the usage of the `@unpack_zerodim_and_defer` decorator and the `compat.set_function_name` function. This relationship might be causing issues in the wrapper function.

The decorator and the `set_function_name` function might not be handling the function correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior. This could be due to incorrect handling of the comparison operation or incorrect wrapping of the function.

To fix the bug, the decorator and function naming logic should be revised to ensure that the comparison operations are handled properly and that the function is correctly wrapped.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    # Removed the usage of the decorator and set_function_name function
    return wrapper
```

In the corrected code, the usage of the decorator and the `set_function_name` function has been removed. The wrapper function no longer uses any additional wrapping or naming logic and directly returns the result. This simplification should resolve the potential issues with the original function.
