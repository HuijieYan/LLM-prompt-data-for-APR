Potential error location: 
It seems that the issue might be in the comparison operations and the handling of different types of input in the `_period_array_cmp` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might be occurring due to incorrect handling of different input types (e.g., strings, integers, lists, etc.) during the comparison operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when comparing Period-like values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add proper handling for different input types to ensure that the comparison operations are performed correctly.
2. Ensure that the correct data types are used for comparison to avoid unexpected behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

        self._check_compatible_with(other)

        result = op(self.ordinal, other.ordinal)

        if self._hasnans or getattr(other, '_hasnans', False):
            result[self._isnan | getattr(other, '_isnan', False)] = nat_result

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```
