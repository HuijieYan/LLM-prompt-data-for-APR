The bug in the `_period_array_cmp` function is likely related to the definition of the `wrapper` function within it. This function is using a decorator (`@unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)`) which is likely intended to unpack a zero-dimensional array and defer the operation until later, but it seems there may be an issue with how this is being applied.

The `wrapper` function appears to be intended to handle comparison operations, such as equality, on Period-like objects. It first constructs the `opname` for the comparison, then attempts to wrap the comparison operation. However, there are multiple conditional statements and checks within the function, which may be leading to unintended behavior.

To address the bug, it may be helpful to simplify the logic within the `wrapper` function, remove redundant code, and ensure that it correctly handles the different cases for comparisons between Period-like objects.

Below is the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:
```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # Construct Period object from int value
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

        if not isinstance(other, self._recognized_scalars) and other is not NaT:
            return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        other = self._scalar_type(other)
        self._check_compatible_with(other)

        result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))
        if isna(other):
            result.fill(nat_result)

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    setattr(wrapper, '__name__', opname)
    return wrapper
```
