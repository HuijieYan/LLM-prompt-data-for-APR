Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring at the line `arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")` where it is trying to convert the input to a NumPy array with object datatype. This may not be compatible with the Int64 datatype.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is trying to convert the input to a NumPy array with object datatype, which may not be compatible with the Int64 datatype that is being passed in the test case.

Approach for fixing the bug: The approach for fixing the bug would be to handle the input of Int64 datatype in a way that is compatible with the rest of the function's logic. This could involve converting the Int64 datatype to a compatible format before processing it further.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
