The error message indicates that the function `array_with_unit_to_datetime()` is being called with 2 arguments instead of at least 3 arguments, which is causing a `TypeError`. This error is occurring within the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` method.

The potential error location within the problematic function is around the following code:
```python
result, tz_parsed = tslib.array_with_unit_to_datetime(arg, unit, errors=errors)
```

This line is calling the function `array_with_unit_to_datetime` from `tslib` module with only two arguments, which is not matching the required number of arguments for the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function requires at least 3 positional arguments, but it is only receiving 2.

To fix this bug, the function `_convert_listlike_datetimes` needs to be updated to pass the required number of arguments to the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function, as well as handle any additional requirements.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    Parameters
    ----------
    (same as before)

    Returns
    -------
    Index-like of parsed dates
    """
    from pandas import DatetimeIndex

    # (existing code here)

    if unit is not None:
        result, tz_parsed = tslib.array_with_unit_to_datetime(arg._values, unit, errors=errors)
        # (existing code here)
    # (rest of the existing code)

    if tz_parsed is not None:
        # We can take a shortcut since the datetime64 numpy array
        # is in UTC
        return DatetimeIndex._simple_new(result, name=name, tz=tz_parsed)

    utc = tz == "utc"
    return _box_as_indexlike(result, utc=utc, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the call to `array_with_unit_to_datetime` includes the required positional argument `arg._values` and also includes the `unit` and `errors` arguments. Additionally, we handle the returned `result` and `tz_parsed` values according to the existing code.
