The error occurs due to the inconsistency between the expected input types and the actual input types. The function `_convert_listlike_datetimes` expects the input `arg` to be a list, tuple, ndarray, Series, or Index, but in this case, it is of type IntegerArray, which causes the function to fail.

The function expects the `arg` parameter to be converted into a numpy array using `arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")`, but since `arg` is an IntegerArray, this line of code might not work as expected.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle the IntegerArray type input. One possible approach is to convert the IntegerArray into a pandas Series and then proceed with the rest of the function as usual.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates
    """
    from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Series
    import numpy as np

    if not isinstance(arg, (list, tuple, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        arg = Series(arg)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # rest of the function remains the same

    return result
```

In the corrected code, an IntegerArray type `arg` is first converted into a pandas Series if it doesn't match any of the expected input types. Then the function proceeds with the rest of the code as usual.
