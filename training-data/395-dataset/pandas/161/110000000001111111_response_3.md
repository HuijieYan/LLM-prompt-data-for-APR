The issue with the fillna function is that when a Series of dtype category is used to fill NaN values in another category column, it overwrites non-NaN values with values from the Series. This is not the expected behavior.

The issue occurs because when a Series of dtype category is used to fill NaN values in another category column, it overrides all values of the column with the new values. This is not the expected behavior. The bug arises because the function does not handle category values properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the fillna function to handle category values properly. The fix involves creating new Series with NaN values filled using the specified method, and then updating the original column only with the NaN values.

Here's the corrected code for the fillna function:

```python
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        (Not implemented yet for Categorical!)
        If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
        NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
        a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
        be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
        maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
        filled.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """
    if value is None:
        value = np.nan
    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet"
        )

    filled_values = self.fillna(value, method, limit)
    
    # Update the original column only with NaN values
    self[self.isna()] = filled_values[self.isna()]

    return self
```

With this fix, the fillna function will correctly handle category values and ensure that only NaN values are updated, leaving non-NaN values intact.
