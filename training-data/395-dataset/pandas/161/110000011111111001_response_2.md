The bug in the provided function is likely due to the implementation of the `fillna` method for the categorical data. The function has a conditional logic for handling different types of fill values including scalar, dict, Series, and other types. However, the conditional checks and handling of the fill values seem to have issues.

The error message from the test functions indicates that for different input values, the expected and actual output series are different. This discrepancy suggests that the `fillna` method is not correctly handling the fill values as per the test cases.

To fix this bug, the conditional logic for handling different types of fill values should be reviewed thoroughly. Additionally, the method for handling fill values within the main function needs to be revisited to ensure that it correctly processes the fill values for categorical data.

Corrected code for the `fillna` method for categorical data:

```python
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed, it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        (Not implemented yet for Categorical!)
        If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
        NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
        a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
        be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
        maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
        filled.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """

    if value is not None:
        if value.__class__.__name__ in ('Series', 'DataFrame'):
            value = value.squeeze()
        value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
            value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=True
        )

    if value is None:
        value = np.nan

    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet"
        )

    codes = self._codes

    # pad / bfill
    # ... (remaining logic remains the same)

    return self._constructor(codes, dtype=self.dtype, fastpath=True)
```

It's important to test these changes with the original test case to ensure that the bug has been fixed. If there are additional failing test cases, further investigation and adjustment may be needed.
