The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `fill_na` method.

The error is likely to be caused by the `value` parameter not being in the categories or being NaN. The code currently provides conditional checks and raises errors based on these conditions.

To address the issue, we should validate whether the value being passed is in the categories or is NaN, and handle each case accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `fill_na` method:

```python
@deprecate_kwarg(old_arg_name="fill_value", new_arg_name="value")
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        (Not implemented yet for Categorical!)
        If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
        NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
        a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
        be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
        maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
        filled.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """
    value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
        value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=False
    )

    if value is None:
        value = np.nan
    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet"
        )

    if isinstance(value, (dict, pd.Series)):
        for idx in value.index:
            if value[idx] not in self.categories:
                raise ValueError("fill value must be in categories")

    elif not isna(value) and value not in self.categories:
        raise ValueError("fill value must be in categories")

    codes = self._codes

    # Rest of the fillna function remains unchanged
    ...
```
In the corrected code, we perform additional checks for the value parameter based on its type. If it's a dictionary or Series, we iterate through its values and raise an error if they are not in the categories. If it's a scalar, we check if it's in the categories or is NaN and raise an error if it's not in the categories.
