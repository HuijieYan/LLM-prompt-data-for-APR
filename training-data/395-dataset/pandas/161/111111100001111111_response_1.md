The issue is occurring in the `fillna` method of the `Categorical` class. The values of the `Categorical` are being overwritten even for non-NaN values.

The bug occurs due to the implementation of the `fillna` method in which all values of the `Categorical` array are being changed based on the fill values. This is unintended and not consistent with the behavior of regular pandas Series.

To fix the bug, the `fillna` method should only fill NaN values and leave non-NaN values unchanged. This can be accomplished by checking for NaN values and only replacing those with the fill values.

Here is the corrected code for the `fillna` method:

```python
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        (Not implemented yet for Categorical!)
        If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
        NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
        a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
        be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
        maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
        filled.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """
    value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
        value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=False
    )

    if value is not None:
        new_codes = self._codes.copy()
        
        if isinstance(value, ABCSeries):
            codes_for_values = _get_codes_for_values(value, self.categories)
            index_nan = (new_codes == -1)
            new_codes[index_nan] = codes_for_values[index_nan]
        else:
            fill_value_code = self.categories.get_loc(value)
            index_nan = (new_codes == -1)
            new_codes[index_nan] = fill_value_code

        return self._constructor(new_codes, dtype=self.dtype, fastpath=True)
    else:
        return self.copy()
```

With this corrected implementation, the `fillna` method will now fill only the NaN values in the `Categorical` array, leaving non-NaN values unchanged. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
