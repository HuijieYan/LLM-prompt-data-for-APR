The error occurs in the fillna method of the Series class. This method is used to fill missing values in a Series with the provided fill_value. The bug causes the fillna method to fill not only the missing values but also the non-missing values of the Series when the fill_value is another Series or categorical data. This behavior is not expected, and the expected behavior is to only fill the missing values.

The reason behind the bug is that the fillna method is not checking for the missing values and directly overwriting all the values with the fill_value. This is due to a logical issue in the implementation of the fillna method.

To fix the bug, the fillna method should be modified to only fill the missing values with the provided fill_value and not the non-missing values. Additionally, the logic for filling categorical data should be improved to accurately handle the categories present in the data.

Below is the corrected code for the fillna method:

```python
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        (Not implemented yet for Categorical!)
        If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
        NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
        a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
        be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
        maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
        filled.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """
    value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
        value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=False
    )

    if value is None:
        value = np.nan
    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet"
        )

    codes = self._codes

    if method is not None:
        values = self.to_dense().reshape(-1, len(self))
        values = interpolate_2d(values, method, 0, None, value).astype(
            self.categories.dtype
        )[0]
        codes = _get_codes_for_values(values, self.categories)
    else:
        fill_mask = self.isna()
        codes[fill_mask] = value
    return self._constructor(codes, dtype=self.dtype, fastpath=True)
```

With the above corrected code, the fillna method should now fill only the missing values with the provided value and leave the non-missing values unchanged, resolving the bug.
