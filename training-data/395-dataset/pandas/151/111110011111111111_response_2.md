The issue seems to be related to the data type mismatch during the assignment, resulting in a TypeError. The error message states that the data type "t" is not understood.

The buggy function `__setitem__` tries to modify the values of the `PandasArray` object by setting a new value at a specific position. However, the data type of the new value may not match the data type of the existing values in the array, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function needs to perform proper data type validation and conversion if necessary. Additionally, the new value should be cast to the appropriate data type before assignment.

Here's the corrected `__setitem__` function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    # Convert the value to the same data type as the array
    value = value.astype(self._ndarray.dtype)

    # Perform the assignment
    self._ndarray[key] = value
```

With the above correction, the function first explicitly converts the new value to the same data type as the array using `astype()`. Then, it performs the assignment to the specified position.

This correction should ensure that the new value's data type matches the array's data type, preventing the TypeError observed in the test cases. Additionally, it also resolves the issue related to the underlying buffer being changed unexpectedly.
