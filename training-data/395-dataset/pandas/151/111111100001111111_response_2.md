Potential error location: The potential error in the code is at the line `t = np.result_type(value, values)` inside the `__setitem__` method of the `PandasArray` class.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the `result_type` function from NumPy is unable to understand the data type of the input value when it is a string. This leads to the TypeError stating that "data type 't' not understood."

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the case when the input value is a string by converting it to an appropriate data type that can be understood by `result_type`.
2. Ensure that the operation of setting an item in the PandasArray does not lead to a change in the underlying buffer.

The corrected code for the `__setitem__` method is as follows:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    values = self._ndarray
    if isinstance(value, str):
        t = np.object
    else:
        t = np.result_type(value, values)
    if t != self._ndarray.dtype:
        values = values.astype(t, casting="safe")
        values[key] = value
        self._dtype = PandasDtype(t)
        self._ndarray = values
    else:
        self._ndarray[key] = value
```

This correction includes a check for whether the input value is a string, in which case the data type `np.object` is used. This ensures that the `result_type` function can understand the data type, preventing the TypeError. Additionally, the underlying buffer is not changed inappropriately.
