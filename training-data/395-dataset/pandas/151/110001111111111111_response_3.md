Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring at the line `t = np.result_type(value, values)` where the `np.result_type()` function is trying to determine the data type for the updated value.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `result_type()` function is not able to understand the data type of the string 't' that is being assigned. This can lead to a `TypeError` when trying to assign a string value to the PandasArray.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type of the updated value is correctly determined and the PandasArray is updated accordingly. We can also address the issue of changing the underlying buffer for PandasArray during assignment.

Corrected code:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    values = self._ndarray
    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        t = value.dtype
    else:
        t = np.result_type(value, values)
    
    if t != self._ndarray.dtype:
        values = values.astype(t, casting="safe")
    values[key] = value
    self._dtype = PandasDtype(values.dtype)
    self._ndarray = values
```

In this corrected code:
- We check if the `value` is scalar or not, and determine its data type accordingly.
- Then we check if the data type matches with the existing PandasArray data type, and if not, update the `values` array with the correct data type.
- Finally, we update the PandasArray with the new values and data type.
