The error message indicates a TypeError related to data type not being understood. The bug is occurring in the `__setitem__` method of the PandasArray class, where the underlying ndarray can be swapped out by setitem, leading to unexpected behavior for views.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the `values` array is being updated.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the data type "t" is not being handled correctly. 

To fix the bug:
- Check the data type "t" and handle it appropriately to ensure it is understood correctly.
- Ensure that the underlying buffer of the PandasArray is not being inadvertently swapped out.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    values = self._ndarray
    t = np.result_type(value, values)
    if t != self._ndarray.dtype:
        new_values = values.astype(t, casting="safe")
        new_values[key] = value
        self._dtype = PandasDtype(t)
        self._ndarray = new_values
    else:
        new_values = self._ndarray.copy()
        new_values[key] = value
        self._ndarray = new_values
```

In the corrected code, the `values` array is checked for its data type "t", and a new array `new_values` is used to ensure that the underlying buffer is not inadvertently swapped out. This should address the issue and prevent unexpected behavior when accessing views of the PandasArray.
