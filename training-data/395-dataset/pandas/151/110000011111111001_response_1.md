The error occurs when the `np.result_type` function is called, as it seems to be caused by incorrect input types for the function.

The bug is likely due to the fact that the dtype of input value is not properly extracted or converted to the desired data type. Here are some potential approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the input data type is properly checked and extracted before performing operations with it.
2. Validate the input parameters and handle different data types appropriately.
3. It might be necessary to explicitly convert the 't' string to the same data type as the input array's dtype before using it for calculations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    values = self._ndarray
    t = np.result_type(values, value)  # Reversing the parameters to result_type
    if t != self._ndarray.dtype:
        values = values.astype(t, casting="safe")
        values[key] = value
        self._dtype = PandasDtype(t)
        self._ndarray = values
    else:
        self._ndarray[key] = value
```
In this corrected code, the `np.result_type` call has been updated to swap the input parameters `value` and `values`. This is to ensure that the intended types are compared and cast correctly.
