The error messages show that the function __setitem__ is trying to assign a string to an array element with the result type "t", which is not understood.

The error seems to be related to data type mismatch or coercion issues while trying to assign a value to the PandasArray. The issue is that the code does not handle the coercion/casting properly, resulting in a type mismatch.

To fix the bug, you may want to consider checking the input value data type and handling the coercion or casting explicitly. Additionally, you can add validation or error handling for invalid data types.

The corrected code for the problematic function __setitem__:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    values = self._ndarray
    # Check if the data type of the array to be assigned is a string
    if values.dtype.kind == 'U' and value.dtype.kind not in 'U':
        raise ValueError("Cannot set non-string array to string array")

    # Explicitly convert the data type of the value to match the array
    value = value.astype(values.dtype)

    self._ndarray[key] = value
``` 

In the corrected code, after checking the validity of the key and value, it also performs additional checks related to the data types and their compatibility before performing the assignment.
