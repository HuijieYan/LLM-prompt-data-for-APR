The test case `test_construction_from_set_raises` is trying to create a DataFrame using a set as a value, and it expects a `TypeError` to be raised due to the unordered nature of sets. However, the test is failing because the error is not being raised.

Upon analyzing the `sanitize_array` function, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of sets within this function.

The code currently does not have any specific handling for sets, which is causing the problem. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, and they are not directly handled in the `sanitize_array` function, which leads to unexpected behavior when a set is encountered.

To fix this issue, we need to add a condition to check for sets and raise a `TypeError` when encountering a set as input data.

Here's the corrected `sanitize_array` function:

```python
def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if isinstance(data, set):
        raise TypeError("Set type is unordered")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By adding the condition to check for sets and raising a `TypeError` when they are encountered, we ensure that the `sanitize_array` function handles sets appropriately and the test case `test_construction_from_set_raises` will pass as expected.
