The test case is trying to construct a DataFrame from a set, which should raise a TypeError with the message "Set type is unordered". However, the test is failing to raise the expected TypeError, indicating that there might be an issue in the code that converts the input to a DataFrame.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `sanitize_array` function. It seems that the function is not handling input data of type `set` correctly, which is resulting in the incorrect behavior observed in the test case.

The bug is occurring because the `sanitize_array` function does not have proper handling for input data of type `set`. As a result, when the test case attempts to construct a DataFrame from a set, it does not raise the expected TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `sanitize_array` function needs to include a specific case for handling input data of type `set`. This case should raise a TypeError with the message "Set type is unordered", as expected by the test case.

Below is the corrected code for the `sanitize_array` function:

```python
def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if isinstance(data, set):
        raise TypeError("Set type is unordered")

    # other parts of the function remain the same
    # ...
    # ...
    # ...
```

By adding the specific case for handling input data of type `set` and raising a TypeError with the expected message, the code will now correctly handle the construction of a DataFrame from a set and the test case should pass as expected.
