The test case is attempting to create a DataFrame using a set as one of the values, which should raise a TypeError because sets are unordered and cannot be used as values in a DataFrame.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `sanitize_array` function, where the input data is being sanitized to an ndarray.

The bug occurs because the `sanitize_array` function does not handle sets appropriately when attempting to create an ndarray. This causes the test case to fail because the expected TypeError is not being raised.

To fix the bug, the `sanitize_array` function should be modified to handle sets as input data and raise a TypeError accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if isinstance(data, set):
        raise TypeError("Set type is unordered")

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...
```
