The test case `test_construction_from_set_raises` is attempting to create a DataFrame with a dictionary containing a set. The expected behavior is to see a single row with the set, but instead, the set is being replicated n times, where n is the length of the actual set.

Upon examining the error message, it's clear that the DataFrame creation did not raise the expected TypeError. This suggests that there is an issue with the `sanitize_array` function which is used internally for data sanitization.

The bug seems to originate from the handling of sets within the `sanitize_array` function. The function is not correctly handling sets in the input data.

To fix this bug, the `sanitize_array` function needs to be updated to properly handle the case of sets in the input data.

Here is the corrected code for the `sanitize_array` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pd.api.types.pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if isinstance(data, (set, dict)):
        data = pd.Series(data)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, if the input data is of type `set`, it is converted to a Pandas Series. This ensures that when a set is encountered in the input, it is appropriately converted to a single row in the DataFrame rather than being replicated n times.
