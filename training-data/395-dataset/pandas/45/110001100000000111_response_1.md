Potential error location: The bug is likely related to the `sanitize_array` function, where the input data is being sanitized to an ndarray, but the behavior when input data is a set is not being handled correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `sanitize_array` function does not handle sets correctly and instead replicates the set n times, where n is the length of the actual set.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type before sanitizing and handle sets differently.
2. Modify the logic for handling sets so that they are not replicated n times.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if isinstance(data, ma.MaskedArray):
        # Handling for MaskedArray
        mask = ma.getmaskarray(data)
        if mask.any():
            data, fill_value = maybe_upcast(data, copy=True)
            data.soften_mask()  # set hardmask False if it was True
            data[mask] = fill_value
        else:
            data = data.copy()

    # Handling for sets
    if isinstance(data, set):
        data = np.array(list(data))

    # The rest of the code remains the same.
    # ...
```

The corrected code includes a handling for sets where the set is converted to an array using `np.array(list(data))` so that it does not get replicated n times in the output.
