Potential Error Location: The `_arith_op` function is not properly handling the case where `left` and `right` have different types.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug occurs because the `_arith_op` function does not handle the case where `left` and `right` have different types. This can lead to errors when trying to perform arithmetic operations on different types of data.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: Update the `_arith_op` function to handle the case where `left` and `right` have different types by adding a check for mixed types and handling them appropriately.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        if isinstance(left, pd.Series) and isinstance(right, pd.Series):
            return left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
            return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```
