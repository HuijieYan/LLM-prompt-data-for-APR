The bug is occurring in the `_combine_frame` function of the DataFrame class. The issue seems to be related to the division operation and the handling of fill_value in the function. The error message indicates that there is a divide by zero encountered in true division and an invalid value encountered in true division.

The reason for this bug could be related to the way the function handles division and the fill_value parameter. It seems that the function is not handling the division operation with fill_value properly, leading to the error. 

To fix this bug, the _combine_frame function should be updated to properly handle the division operation and the fill_value parameter. This can be achieved by ensuring that the division is performed correctly, taking into account the fill_value when necessary.

Below is the corrected code for the _combine_frame function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
      if fill_value is not None:
          left = left.replace({0: fill_value})
          right = right.replace({0: fill_value})
      return func(left, right)

    result = _arith_op(this, other)
    return self._constructor(
        result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
    )
```

In the corrected code, the _arith_op function now properly handles the fill_value for the division operation. It replaces the 0 values with the fill_value before performing the division. This ensures that the division operation is performed correctly, taking into account the fill_value parameter.
