Potential error location: 

The potential error location is in the `_arith_op` function within the `_combine_frame` method. This function should be a method of the `DataFrame` class, but it is defined as a nested function inside the `_combine_frame` method. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurred because the `_arith_op` function is intended to be a method of the `DataFrame` class and should be defined at the class level. However, it is defined as a nested function inside the `_combine_frame` method, which is causing the error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

The `_arith_op` function should be defined at the class level, outside of the `_combine_frame` method, to ensure it can be accessed by other methods that require it.

Corrected code:

```python
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Corrected _arith_op method
    def _arith_op(self, left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    # this is the corrected _combine_frame function
    def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
        this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
        new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

        if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
            # iterate over columns
            return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, self._arith_op)
        else:
            result = self._arith_op(this.values, other.values)
            return self._constructor(
                result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
            )
```
