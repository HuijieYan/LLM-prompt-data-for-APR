Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the `_combine_frame` function, specifically in the line `this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)` where it seems that the `align` function is being called incorrectly.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug likely occurs because the `align` function is being called with the incorrect parameters and arguments. This will cause the alignment to not work as intended, leading to potential errors in the subsequent operations in the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the documentation or function definition of the `align` function to ensure that the correct parameters and arguments are being used.
2. Verify that the parameters such as `join`, `level`, and `copy` are being used correctly when calling the `align` function.
3. Understand the expected behavior of the `align` function in order to align the data frames correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_159/pandas/core/frame.py

# corrected _combine_frame function
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join='outer', axis=0, level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
``` 
In the corrected code, the `align` function is called with the correct parameters and arguments, ensuring that the data frames are aligned properly before performing the subsequent operations.
