The bug in the `_combine_frame` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the fill_value when performing arithmetic operations between DataFrames with different shapes. When aligning the DataFrames, the fill_value is not being properly applied, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the fill_value needs to be correctly applied when aligning the DataFrames and performing the arithmetic operation `_arith_op`.

The corrected implementation for the `_combine_frame` function is as follows:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    result = _arith_op(this, other)
    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

This correction ensures that the fill_value is correctly used during the align operation and in the arithmetic operation `_arith_op`. With this correction, the bug should be fixed, and the test cases `test_fill_value_inf_masking` and `test_dataframe_div_silenced` should pass without any errors.
