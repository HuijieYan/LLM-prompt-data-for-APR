The bug occurs when the `DataFrame.rfloordiv` method is used with the `fill_value` parameter. This method is designed for reverse division, i.e., `other / df` as opposed to `df / other`.

The error message and the test case suggest that the bug might be related to the alignment of different columns and indices in the `DataFrame.rfloordiv` method.

The issue arises due to the inconsistent handling of the `fill_value` parameter when performing arithmetic operations. When alignment happens for different columns and indices, the `fill_value` should be used consistently to fill missing values. However, in the current implementation, there is an inconsistency in assigning `fill_value` in the arithmetic operations.

To fix this bug, the `_combine_frame` method should be modified to ensure consistent handling of the `fill_value` parameter. This will involve making adjustments to the logic within the `_combine_frame` method to correctly use the `fill_value` parameter when performing the arithmetic operations.

Below is the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

With this corrected code, the `fill_value` parameter will be consistently applied during the arithmetic operations, ensuring that the operations yield the expected results and that any missing values are correctly filled.

This corrected implementation should resolve the bug and ensure that the `DataFrame.rfloordiv` method behaves as expected, including when the `fill_value` parameter is used.
