The bug seems to be related to the division operation performed by the `rfloordiv` method of the DataFrame class in pandas. The `RuntimeWarning` encountered in the test cases suggests that there might be issues related to division by zero or invalid value encountered during the true division.

Based on the error messages and test cases, it seems that the issue is arising due to how the `fill_value` parameter is handled during the division operation.

To fix this bug, the `_combine_frame` method needs to be modified to ensure that the division operation handles the `fill_value` properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
    return self._constructor(
        result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
    )
```

In this corrected code, we directly perform the arithmetic operation on `this.values` and `other.values` using the `_arith_op` function, effectively handling the `fill_value` parameter during the operation. This approach should fix the bug and handle division by zero and invalid value encountered during the true division.

Once this corrected code is implemented, the test cases should pass without encountering the `RuntimeWarning` related to the division operation.
