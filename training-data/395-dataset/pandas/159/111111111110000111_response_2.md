The error messages indicate that there are issues with the `rfloordiv` and `div` methods of the DataFrame class. These issues are related to the handling of NaN and fill_value.

Upon analysis, it appears that the issue is likely occurring in the `_combine_frame` method of the DataFrame class. The logic for performing the arithmetic operation and handling fill_value might be causing the unexpected behavior observed in the test cases.

The occurrence of the bug might be due to the incorrect handling of NaN and fill_value when performing arithmetic operations in the `_combine_frame` method. It seems that the fill_value is not being utilized properly, leading to unexpected results and inconsistencies in the output.

To fix the bug, the `_combine_frame` method needs to be modified to ensure proper handling of NaN and fill_value during arithmetic operations. Specifically, the logic for handling fill_value and NaN when performing the arithmetic operation should be revised to align with the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # Iterate over columns
        result = ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, func)
    else:
        left_values = this.values
        right_values = other.values

        if fill_value is not None:
            left_values = left_values.fillna(fill_value)
            right_values = right_values.fillna(fill_value)

        result_values = func(left_values, right_values)

        if fill_value is not None:
            result_values = result_values.fillna(fill_value)

        result = self._constructor(result_values, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)

    return result
```

In this corrected code, the fill_value is properly applied to the values before and after the arithmetic operation to ensure consistent behavior and handling of NaN values. This should address the issues observed in the test cases and resolve the bug related to the DataFrame arithmetic operations.
