The error messages indicate that there are issues with the division operation and the use of fill values. The first error message is related to division by zero, while the second error message is related to warnings caused by the division operation.

The potential error location in the `_combine_frame` function is the handling of the fill value during the arithmetic operation. It seems that the logic for using the fill value in the arithmetical operations may be causing the issues, leading to unexpected results and warnings.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review the logic for using fill values in the arithmetic operations and ensure that division by zero is properly handled. Additionally, it's important to ensure that no unexpected warnings are raised during the arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected function for `_combine_frame`:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    result = this.combine(other, func, fill_value=fill_value)
    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

This corrected function uses the `combine` method to perform the element-wise binary operation with another DataFrame, applying the given function. The `fill_value` parameter is applied to handle missing values. This approach should address the issues related to the division operation and the handling of fill values, resulting in the proper execution of the arithmetic operations.
