Potential error location: The error occurs within the `_combine_frame` function, specifically in the logic related to `ops.fill_binop` and `ops.should_series_dispatch`.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug could stem from incorrect application of the `ops.fill_binop` and `ops.should_series_dispatch` functions. These functions are used to handle arithmetic operations on frames and series, and it seems that they might not be working as intended, resulting in unexpected values and warnings in the test cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the implementation of the `ops.fill_binop` and `ops.should_series_dispatch` functions to ensure that they handle the arithmetic operations correctly.
2. Ensure that the arithmetic operations between dataframes and series are properly aligned and that the fill values are handled appropriately.
3. Validate the dispatch logic for series operations and ensure it is working as intended.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", axis=None, level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```
