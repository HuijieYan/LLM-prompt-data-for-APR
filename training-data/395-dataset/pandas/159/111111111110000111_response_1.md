The bug is occurring in the `_combine_frame` method within the `DataFrame` class. The method is intended to perform arithmetic operations between two DataFrames, but it seems to be mishandling the `fill_value` parameter, leading to unexpected results and triggering error messages in the test cases.

The error messages indicate that the output of the arithmetic operation is incorrect, leading to failed assertions in the test cases. The specific issue seems to be related to the handling of `fill_value` in the arithmetic operation.

It seems that when performing the arithmetic operation with `fill_value` specified, the method is not properly handling the cases where the denominator is zero, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `_combine_frame` method should be updated to properly handle the `fill_value` parameter, especially in cases where the denominator is zero. Proper checks and conditional logic should be implemented to ensure that division by zero is handled appropriately.

The corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method is as follows:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        if fill_value is not None and func.__name__ in ['rfloordiv', 'rtruediv']:
            right = right.replace(0, fill_value)  # Replace 0 with fill_value in the denominator
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the corrected code:
- The `_arith_op` function now has a check for `fill_value` and modifies the denominator to replace 0 with the specified `fill_value` for operations like rfloordiv and rtruediv.
- This ensures that division by zero is handled correctly and prevents unexpected behavior when using `fill_value` in arithmetic operations.
