The issue with the given function `_combine_frame` is that it is not properly aligning the input DataFrames before performing the arithmetic operation. This can lead to runtime warnings and incorrect results in some cases, as shown in the provided test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input DataFrames `self` and `other` are aligned properly before applying the arithmetic operation. This alignment should consider the specified `level`, and the `fill_value` should be handled correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False, fill_value=fill_value)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        return func(left, right)

    if hasattr(this, 'values') and hasattr(other, 'values'):
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Input DataFrames are not aligned properly")
```

In the corrected code:
- We have added the `fill_value` as an argument to the `align` function to ensure that the alignment takes the fill value into account.
- We have simplified the `_arith_op` function to directly apply the specified `func` to the aligned values `left` and `right`.
- We have included a check to ensure that the input DataFrames have valid values before performing the arithmetic operation.

These modifications ensure that the input DataFrames are properly aligned and that the arithmetic operation is applied correctly, addressing the potential runtime warnings and incorrect results.

Please note that the mentioned fixes are based on the assumption that the primary issue lies in the alignment and arithmetic operation within the `_combine_frame` function. Additional testing and validation may be necessary for a comprehensive solution.
