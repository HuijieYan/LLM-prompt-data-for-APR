The issue seems to be related to the arithmetic operation being performed in the `_combine_frame` method. The error message indicates that there is a divide by zero and an invalid value encountered, which suggests that the arithmetic operation is not handling the fill_value parameter correctly.

The bug is likely occurring within the `_arith_op` function, where the `fill_value` parameter is not being properly handled during the arithmetic operation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `fill_value` parameter is correctly handled within the `_arith_op` function, and that it is applied during the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Apply fill_value to left and right
        left = left.fillna(fill_value)
        right = right.fillna(fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this, other)  # Update to use _arith_op directly with DataFrames
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the corrected code, we handle the `fill_value` by using the `fillna` method to replace any NaN values with the `fill_value` before performing the arithmetic operation. This ensures that the `fill_value` is correctly applied during the operation and should resolve the issues related to the divide by zero and invalid value encountered.
