The error seems to be occurring within the `_combine_frame` method. The core problem lies in the `_arith_op` function used within `_combine_frame`. It seems that the `_arith_op` function is intended to be a private method of the `_combine_frame` function, but it is defined outside the scope of `_combine_frame` and is called directly within it. This is likely causing the method to behave unexpectedly and resulting in a buggy behavior.

To fix this, we need to redefine the `_arith_op` function within the `_combine_frame` method so that it's isolated within the scope of the method. This will prevent potential conflicts and unexpected behaviors caused by defining functions outside of the main method structure.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `_arith_op` function is defined within the scope of the `_combine_frame` method. This should resolve the issues caused by the usage of `_arith_op` and prevent any unexpected behaviors.
