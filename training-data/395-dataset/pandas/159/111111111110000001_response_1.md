The error message from the test function `test_fill_value_inf_masking` indicates that the function `rfloordiv` is not working as expected, resulting in a DataFrame with incorrect values in column 'A' and 'B'. The error message mentions a difference between the expected and actual values.

In the function `_combine_frame`, the issue could be related to the arithmetic operation being performed, leading to unexpected results. The `_arith_op` function is used for performing the arithmetic operation and is a potential location for the bug.

The bug is mainly due to how the arithmetic operation is handled within the `_combine_frame` function. The filling operation with values like `Inf` and `NaN` is not being handled correctly, leading to unexpected results.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the arithmetic operation properly handles cases where the data contains `Inf` and `NaN` values. Additionally, considering the fill value and its impact on the operation will be crucial.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # For the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        if fill_value is not None:
          left, right = left.fillna(fill_value), right.fillna(fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # Iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this, other)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

In the corrected code, the `_arith_op` function checks if a fill value is provided and fills the `left` and `right` DataFrames with the specified fill value before performing the arithmetic operation. This ensures that any `Inf` or `NaN` values are handled appropriately during the operation.
