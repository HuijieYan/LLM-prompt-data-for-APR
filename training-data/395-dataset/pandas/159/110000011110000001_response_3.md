The error message from the test "test_fill_value_inf_masking" indicates a discrepancy in the values of the DataFrame. It specifically mentions that the values in the first column of the DataFrame are different than expected, with different percentages of difference in values.

The error message from the test "test_dataframe_div_silenced" points to an unexpected warning being caused when running the test. It indicates that there is a warning related to division by zero, which is not anticipated in this context.

Upon analyzing the provided code, the potential error location within the problematic function "_combine_frame" is in the section where it handles the operation between 'this' and 'other', specifically in the handling of fill_value during the operation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be a mishandling of the fill_value parameter, leading to unexpected behavior during the arithmetic operation.

To fix the bug, the fill_value parameter handling in the _combine_frame function should be modified to ensure that it is applied correctly during the arithmetic operation.

Here's the corrected code for the _combine_frame function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        ).fillna(fill_value)
```
