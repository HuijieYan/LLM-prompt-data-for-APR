The bug appears to be in the `_combine_frame` method of the DataFrame class in the pandas library. The bug is likely related to the division operation when using `fill_value` as 0. The error message suggests that there are warnings for divide by zero and invalid value encountered.

The potential error location is the `_arith_op` function within the `_combine_frame` method. The division operation might be encountering issues when `fill_value` is set to 0.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the division operation is encountering divide by zero and invalid value issues, most likely due to the `fill_value` parameter being set to 0.

To fix the bug, the division operation should handle the case when divide by 0 occurs and should also handle the case of invalid values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Handle divide by zero and invalid values
        with np.errstate(divide='ignore', invalid='ignore'):
            # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
            # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
            # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
            left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
            return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
``` 

In the corrected code, we have added a context manager `with np.errstate(divide='ignore', invalid='ignore')` to handle divide by zero and invalid values encountered during the division operation. This should address the warnings and potential issues with the division operation when using `fill_value` as 0.
