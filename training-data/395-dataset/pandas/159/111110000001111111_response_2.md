The bug seems to be related to division by zero and invalid values encountered in the true division operation, which triggers runtime warnings. The issue is likely due to the inconsistency in the handling of different column and index alignments.

To fix the bug, the _combine_frame function should be modified to handle division by zero and invalid values appropriately. This can be achieved by updating the code to ensure that the division operation and handling of fill values are carried out correctly, considering the alignment of different columns and index labels.

Here's the corrected code for the _combine_frame method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    # Define custom division operation with proper handling of division by zero and invalid values
    def _div_op(left, right, fill_value):
        return left.div(right, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Apply the division operation to the aligned DataFrames
    result = _div_op(this, other, fill_value)

    # Create a new DataFrame with the result and aligned index and columns
    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

In this corrected code, the _div_op function is introduced to handle the division operation, and the result is used to create a new DataFrame with the proper alignment of index and columns.

These changes should ensure that the division operation is handled correctly, and the runtime warnings related to division by zero and invalid values are resolved.
