Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is that the function is not properly combining frames using the input parameters and may not be handling different data types properly.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the function is not properly aligning the frames and may not be handling different data types appropriately.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper alignment of frames using the `align` method.
2. Handle different data types properly, especially in the `_arith_op` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Ensure proper handling of different data types
        if isinstance(left, pd.Series) and isinstance(right, pd.Series):
            left, right = left.align(right, join="outer")
        else:
            left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```
In the above corrected code, we have added a condition to ensure proper handling of different data types in the `_arith_op` function. We also aligned the left and right data if they are both instances of the `pd.Series` class. This should fix the issues related to combining frames and handling different data types.
