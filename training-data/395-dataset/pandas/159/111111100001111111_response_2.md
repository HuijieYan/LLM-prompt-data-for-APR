The bug seems to be caused by a divide-by-zero error when performing division on DataFrames with different shapes and missing data. The issue arises when doing element-wise division with `fill_value` set to 0, causing a divide-by-zero warning to be raised.

The `_combine_frame` function appears to be the problematic function, as it is performing division with `fill_value` set to 0. This function uses the `align` method to align the two DataFrames along the specified axis, filling missing values with the `fill_value`. The issue arises when doing element-wise division with such aligned DataFrames.

To fix this bug, we can handle division by zero and missing values properly while aligning the DataFrames and performing the element-wise division. This can be done by setting the default `fill_value` to a non-zero value, and then checking for potential divide-by-zero errors and missing values during the division.

Here's the corrected function for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        
        # Handle division by zero and missing values
        result = ops.sanitize_fill_value(result, fill_value)
        
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

With this correction, the function should handle division by zero and missing values properly when aligning and performing the element-wise division on the DataFrames. This would avoid the divide-by-zero warning and ensure proper behaviour when using `fill_value` as 0.
