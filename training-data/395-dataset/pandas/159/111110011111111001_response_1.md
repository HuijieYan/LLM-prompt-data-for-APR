The error that the test case `test_fill_value_inf_masking` is encountering is due to a bug in the `_combine_frame` method. The use of `_arith_op` function does not seem to be implemented correctly, and the returned result is not as expected.

The test case `test_dataframe_div_silenced` is encountering an error due to unexpected warnings. This may also be related to the bug in the `_combine_frame` method.

Potential Error Location:
The `_arith_op` function implementation within the `_combine_frame` method seems to be incorrect, leading to unexpected results and warnings.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect implementation of the arithmetic operations on the data frames when using the `fill_value` parameter in the `_combine_frame` method. This results in unexpected results and warnings.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement the `_arith_op` function properly, ensuring that it handles arithmetic operations with the `fill_value`.
2. Update the logic for handling arithmetic operations in the `_combine_frame` method to incorporate the filled values correctly.

Corrected Code for the `_combine_frame` Method:
```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Handle arithmetic operations with fill_value
        left_filled = left.fillna(fill_value)
        right_filled = right.fillna(fill_value)
        return func(left_filled, right_filled)

    result = _arith_op(this, other)

    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```
In the corrected code, the `fill_value` is applied to the left and right operands within the `_arith_op` function to ensure proper handling of arithmetic operations with the filled values. This should address the unexpected results and warnings encountered in the test cases.
