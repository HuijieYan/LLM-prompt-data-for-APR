The bug occurs in the `_combine_frame` function. The function is attempting to align two DataFrames, `self` and `other`, using the `align` method. However, the align method is used incorrectly, resulting in incorrect values during the operation. The function then proceeds to perform arithmetic operations and create a new DataFrame, resulting in incorrect values and types.

One reason for this bug could be an incorrect usage of the `align` method and how the subsequent arithmetic operations are performed.

To fix the bug, the function `_combine_frame` should properly utilize the `align` method and ensure that the subsequent arithmetic operations are done correctly. It's essential to minimize the chances of mismatched operations and ensure alignment and arithmetic operations are performed with proper handling of fill values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Perform the arithmetic operation, accounting for NaN and fill values
        return func(left, right, fill_value=fill_value)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # Iterate over columns and apply the arithmetic operation
        result = ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        # Perform the arithmetic operation on DataFrame values
        result_values = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        result = self._constructor(result_values, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)

    return result
```

With this corrected function, it ensures that the DataFrame alignment is maintained properly, and arithmetic operations are performed accurately with the fill values considered. This should address the incorrect values and types observed in the test cases.
