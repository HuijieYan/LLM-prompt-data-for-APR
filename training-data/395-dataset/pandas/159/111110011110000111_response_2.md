The bug seems to be in the `_combine_frame` function of the `DataFrame` class. The error message from the test function `test_fill_value_inf_masking` suggests a problem with the division operation, indicating that the bug might be related to performing arithmetic operations between dataframes in some cases.

The error message for the `test_fill_value_inf_masking` function indicates a failure in comparing the expected and actual outputs, specifically mentioning a difference in the values of `DataFrame.iloc[:, 0]`.

The error message for the `test_dataframe_div_silenced` function also indicates a problem related to division operations, specifically with fill_value=0.

Based on the error messages and the test cases describing division operations, it seems that the bug is caused by a problem with handling the division operation in the `_combine_frame` function, possibly related to handling fill values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_combine_frame` function to ensure that the arithmetic operations, particularly division, are handled correctly, taking into account the fill value provided.

Below is the corrected `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the corrected function, we ensure that the arithmetic operations handle the fill value correctly, especially in the case of division operations. This should address the issues related to the division operations in the original buggy function.
