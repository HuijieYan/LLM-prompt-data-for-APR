The bug is occurring in the `_combine_frame` method. The error message from the test functions indicates that the division operation is not handling `fill_value=0` correctly. This is likely to be related to the division operation in the `_arith_op` function inside the `_combine_frame` method.

The bug is likely occurring because the division is not handling fill values correctly. It seems that the fill_value is not being properly applied during the division operation. This is leading to unexpected warnings about divide by zero and invalid value encountered.

To fix the bug, the division operation inside the `_arith_op` function should be modified to properly handle the fill value. The division operation should check if the denominator is zero, and if so, use the fill value instead. Additionally, the warning handling in the test function might need to be adjusted to correctly validate the warning in the division operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Check if right side is zero, if so, use fill_value
        right_nonzero = right != 0
        right[right_nonzero] = 1
        right[right == 0] = fill_value
        # Perform division with fill_value handling
        result = func(left, right)
        result[right == fill_value] = fill_value
        return result

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

With the above modification, the division operation inside the `_arith_op` function will correctly handle the fill value, preventing unexpected warnings and ensuring correct division behavior with the fill value.
