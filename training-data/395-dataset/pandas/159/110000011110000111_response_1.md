The error message from the test function `test_fill_value_inf_masking` indicates that the `rfloordiv` method is not returning the expected result. The calculations are not being performed correctly and are leading to differences between the expected and actual results.

Upon further investigation, it seems that the issue is located in the `_combine_frame` method. It seems that the implementation of the `_arith_op` function within `_combine_frame` is not handling the fill_value correctly, which is causing the incorrect results in the test cases.

The bug occurs because the `_arith_op` function is not handling the fill_value properly when performing the arithmetic operations (`rfloordiv` in this case). This results in incorrect calculations and discrepancies between the expected and actual results.

To fix the bug, the `_arith_op` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the fill_value. Specifically, when performing the arithmetic operation, the fill_value should be appropriately used to handle any missing or NaN values in the dataframes.

Here's the corrected `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In this corrected `_combine_frame` method, the `fill_value` is appropriately handled within the `_arith_op` function, ensuring that it is used to fill any missing or NaN values before performing the arithmetic operations.

By implementing these changes, the bug in the `_combine_frame` method should be fixed, and the `rfloordiv` method should return the expected results in the test cases.
