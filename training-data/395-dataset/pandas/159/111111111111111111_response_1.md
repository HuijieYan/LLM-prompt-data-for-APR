The reported bug seems to involve a combination of division, floor division, and the use of a fill value. The provided test cases indicate that in some situations, the expected result is not matching the actual output. The error message also indicates a "divide by zero" warning, which suggests the need for better handling of the fill value.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the issue arises from the way the `fill_value` parameter is being handled during the arithmetic operations, especially when division by zero or invalid values occur.

To fix this bug, the `_combine_frame` function needs to handle the `fill_value` appropriately, especially when performing arithmetic operations. Additionally, it should consider edge cases like division by zero and invalid values.

Here's the corrected code for the `DataFrame._combine_frame` function with modifications to handle `fill_value` properly:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    if fill_value is not None and np.isfinite(fill_value):
        fill_value = float(fill_value)  # Ensuring fill value is float for division operations

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Handling the fill value for division
        if fill_value is not None and func in [np.floor_divide, np.divide]:
            left = np.where(right == 0, fill_value, left)
            right = np.where(right == 0, fill_value, right)

        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

With these changes, the `fill_value` parameter is appropriately handled during arithmetic operations, especially for division, and it also takes care of cases like division by zero and invalid values.

This corrected function should address the reported bug by handling the `fill_value` appropriately during arithmetic operations in the `DataFrame._combine_frame` function.
