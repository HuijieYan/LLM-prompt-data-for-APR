The error messages are related to the test cases `test_fill_value_inf_masking` and `test_dataframe_div_silenced`. Both error messages indicate that there were issues with division operations and handling NaN/Inf values.

The potential error location within the `_combine_frame` function is likely within the section that handles the division operation, specifically where `this` and `other` are aligned using the `align` method, and subsequently the `_arith_op` function which handles the actual arithmetic operation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the arithmetic operation is not properly handling NaN and Inf values, resulting in unexpected outcomes.

To fix the bug, the arithmetic operation should be updated to handle NaN and Inf values appropriately, such as by using the `div` method with fill_value specified, or by incorporating explicit conditional checks for NaN and Inf values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # For division operation, use div method with fill_value
        if func.__name__ in ("rfloordiv", "floordiv"):
            return left.div(right, fill_value=fill_value)
        else:
            # For other arithmetic operations, handle NaN/Inf values
            left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
            return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # Iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

The corrected code includes a specific conditional check for division operations (rfloordiv or floordiv) to handle NaN/Inf values using the `div` method with the specified fill_value. For other arithmetic operations, the `_arith_op` function now includes handling for NaN/Inf values to ensure proper outcome.
