The error occurs in the function `url_for` within the class `Sanic`. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the host argument when building the URL for a blueprint. It appears that the function is not correctly using the host argument provided in the Blueprint when constructing the URL. 

To fix this bug, the `url_for` function should incorporate the host argument from the Blueprint when building the URL. Additionally, it should handle both internal and external URLs properly, returning the correct hostname and path based on the given view name.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    # special static files url_for
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    if view_name == "static" or view_name.endswith(".static"):
        filename = kwargs.pop("filename", None)
        # it's static folder
        if "<file_uri:" in uri:
            folder_ = uri.split("<file_uri:", 1)[0]
            if folder_.endswith("/"):
                folder_ = folder_[:-1]

            if filename.startswith("/"):
                filename = filename[1:]

            uri = "{}/{}".format(folder_, filename)

    if uri != "/" and uri.endswith("/"):
        uri = uri[:-1]

    out = uri

    # construct the host from the blueprint
    host = kwargs.pop('_host', None)  # get the host from kwargs
    if host is None:  # if not provided, take it from the route
        host = route.host

    # build the URL with the correct hostname and path
    url = f"http://{host}{uri}"

    # handle external urls
    if kwargs.pop('_external', False):
        scheme = kwargs.pop('_scheme', 'http')  # default to http
        netloc = host
        query_string = urlencode(kwargs, doseq=True) if kwargs else ""
        anchor = kwargs.pop('_anchor', "")
        url = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, uri, "", query_string, anchor))

    return url
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to obtain the host from the kwargs or the route when constructing the URL. We also handle the `_external` flag to determine whether to build an external URL and include the query parameters in the URL.
