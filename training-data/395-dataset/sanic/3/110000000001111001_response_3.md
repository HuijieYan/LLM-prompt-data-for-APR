The issue with the function seems to be in processing the route and building the URL. The function is not handling the route and URL generation as expected, leading to the wrong URL being built.

One potential issue is with the conditional check for the view name. In the code, there are conditional checks for "static" and ".static", but there might be other view names that need to be handled differently. This could lead to incorrect processing of the view name and incorrect URL generation.

Another issue might be with how the parameters are being processed and replaced in the URL. The function seems to be using regular expressions to replace parameters, and there could be a problem with the regex patterns or replacement process.

To fix the bug, you can consider refactoring the conditional checks for view name and handling a wider range of view names. Additionally, reviewing the parameter replacement process and ensuring it works correctly could help fix the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        uri = uri.replace("<" + key + ">", str(value))

    query_string = urlencode({key: value for key, value in kwargs.items() if key not in route.parameters}, doseq=True)
    
    url = uri
    if query_string:
        url += '?' + query_string

    return url
```

This corrected function simplifies the URL building process by directly replacing the parameters in the route URI and then adding any additional query parameters to the URL. This approach should help in generating the correct URLs for different view names and parameters.
