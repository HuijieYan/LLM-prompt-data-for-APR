The function `url_for` is supposed to build a URL based on a view name and the values provided. However, based on the input and expected test cases, it seems that the function is failing to generate the correct URL and handle the parameters as expected.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the parameters in the `uri` while building the URL. The parameters provided in the kwargs are not being properly replaced in the URL, and the query string is not being constructed effectively.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle the parameters and replace them within the URI. It should also construct the query string based on the remaining kwargs.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}

    # ... existing code ...

    for match in matched_params:
        name, _type, pattern = self.router.parse_parameter_string(match)

        if name in kwargs:
            supplied_param = kwargs.get(name)
            
            if supplied_param is not None:
                supplied_param = str(supplied_param)
                out = out.replace(f"<{name}>", supplied_param)
            else:
                raise URLBuildError(
                    f"Required parameter `{name}` was not passed to url_for"
                )

    query_string = urlencode(kwargs, doseq=True) if kwargs else ""
    out = out + '?' + query_string if query_string else out

    return out
```

In the corrected code, we iterate through the matched parameters and replace them in the `out` URI if they are found in `kwargs`. Then, we construct the query string based on the remaining kwargs and append it to the `out` URI before returning. This approach ensures that all parameters are handled correctly and the query string is appropriately constructed.
