The bug is with the `url_for` function of the `Sanic` class. It seems to be overly complex and contains many conditional statements that might not be necessary. The bug appears to be related to how the `uri` and `out` variables are processed based on the `view_name`.

The function first checks if the `view_name` is "static", and if so, updates the `name` with the value from the `kwargs`. Then it checks if the `view_name` ends with ".static" and updates the `name` accordingly. After that, it calls `self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)` to find the appropriate route and uri.

The bug might occur due to the complexity of the conditional statements and the handling of `uri` and `out` based on different conditions. Additionally, the code tries to extract certain parameters from the `uri` and replace them based on the provided `kwargs`, which adds to the complexity.

To fix the bug, it might be better to simplify the logic of the function and carefully handle the extraction and replacement of parameters in the `uri`. Additionally, introducing comprehensive unit tests for each conditional block and different function inputs would help to identify specific issues and expected behavior.

Based on the provided code and the described error scenarios, here's the corrected `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name)
    
    if not route:
        raise URLBuildError("Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name))
    
    uri = route.uri
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        uri = uri.replace("<{}>".format(key), value)
    
    return uri
```

In this corrected version, the function first finds the route based on the `view_name`, and then iterates through the `kwargs` to replace any placeholders in the `uri` with the corresponding values. This simplifies the logic and avoids unnecessary conditional checks and multiple variable manipulations.
