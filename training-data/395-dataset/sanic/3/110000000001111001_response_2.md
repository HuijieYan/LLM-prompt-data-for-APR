Potential Error Location: The issue may be in the code that handles the 'uri' variable and constructs the URL. It seems that the 'uri' variable is not being correctly parsed and built into the final URL.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The 'uri' variable might not be correctly constructed due to parsing or concatenation errors. This could be due to incorrect handling of different cases such as when 'view_name' is 'static' or when it ends with '.static'.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to ensure that the 'uri' variable is constructed correctly based on the 'view_name' and 'kwargs' provided. This may involve handling special cases like 'static' and '.static' separately and parsing 'kwargs' to construct the correct 'uri' for the given 'view_name'.

Corrected Code:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.
    
    ... (same documentation as before)
    
    :return: the built URL
    
    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    # special static files url_for
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # Constructing the URL based on uri, view_name, and kwargs
    filename = kwargs.pop("filename", None)
    if "<file_uri:" in uri:
        folder_ = uri.split("<file_uri:", 1)[0]
        if folder_.endswith("/"):
            folder_ = folder_[:-1]

        if filename and filename.startswith("/"):
            filename = filename[1:]
            
        # Concatenating the folder and filename to form the URL
        uri = "{}/{}".format(folder_, filename if filename else '')
    
    uri = uri.rstrip('/')
    
    out = uri
    
    # ... (same code as before)

    query_string = urlencode(kwargs, doseq=True) if kwargs else ""
    out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

This corrected code should handle the construction of the 'uri' and the URL correctly based on the 'view_name' and 'kwargs' provided. It also includes the necessary parsing and concatenation to ensure that the URL is built accurately.
