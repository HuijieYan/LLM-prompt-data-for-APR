The bug here seems to be related to the `uri` and `route` variables not being used correctly. The `uri` variable should not be updated in the section of code that follows the check for 'static' or '.static' in the `view_name`.

The `out` variable is initially set to `uri` and then gets updated with the built URL. However, if the `uri` is incorrectly updated, it will affect the final built URL.

To fix the bug, the `uri` variable should be manipulated only when it is not related to the 'static' or '.static' cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    # ... (previous code)

    out = uri  # Set out variable to initial uri value

    if uri != "/" and uri.endswith("/"):
        uri = uri[:-1]

    # find all the parameters we will need to build in the URL
    matched_params = re.findall(self.router.parameter_pattern, uri)

    # ... (subsequent code)
    
    # manipulated uri only when it's not in 'static' or '.static' cases
    if out != "/" and out.endswith("/"):
        out = out[:-1]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return out
```
