The test case `test_routes_with_host` is checking the output of the `url_for` function for various view names, both with and without the `_external` flag being set.

The bug seems to be in the `url_for` function, particularly the logic related to building the URL for a view name that has a host specified. When the `host` is specified, it is incorrectly being treated as a part of the path instead of the hostname.

The issue seems to stem from the section of code that handles the scenario when `view_name` ends with ".static" and the section that handles the `_external` flag. It's likely that the logic for handling the host is incorrect and is contributing to the incorrect URI building.

To fix the bug, the code logic that handles the manipulation of the `uri` and `out` variables based on the host parameter needs to be reviewed and corrected. The conditions for handling the `host` and `_external` flags need to be re-evaluated to ensure that the correct URL with the appropriate host and path is being constructed.

Here's the corrected `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.
    
    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.
    
    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.
    
    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.
    
    :return: the built URL
    
    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    # special static files url_for
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # Handle the host and path based on the route
    if route.host:
        host = route.host
    else:
        host = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")

    if not host and route.uri != "/":
        uri = f"/{uri}"

    # Handle the external flag
    scheme = kwargs.pop("_scheme", "")
    if "_external" in kwargs and kwargs.pop("_external"):
        if not host and scheme:
            raise ValueError("When specifying _scheme, host must be specified")

    # Process any parameters and build the URL
    for param, value in kwargs.items():
        if param in route.parameters:
            uri = uri.replace(f"<{param}>", value)
        else:
            # This is a query parameter
            if "?" in uri:
                uri += f"&{param}={value}"
            else:
                uri += f"?{param}={value}"
    
    # Build the final URL based on the components
    if scheme:
        out = f"{scheme}://{host}{uri}"
    else:
        out = f"//{host}{uri}"

    return out
``` 

The corrected function has been updated to handle the host and path based on the route, as well as to correctly process the `_external` flag and any additional parameters. This should address the issue with building the correct URL when a host is specified.
