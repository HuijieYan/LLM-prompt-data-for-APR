The bug in the `url_for` function is likely related to the incorrect assignment of the `uri` variable and the subsequent parsing of the URL parameters.

The function's process for finding and processing parameters to build the URL is complex and requires careful handling. It involves checking the view name, populating the `kw` dictionary, locating the route, handling special cases such as static files, and processing parameters and query strings.

The error cases and expected results indicate that the function does not handle the `uri` and route parsing correctly for host-related views. It also does not correctly handle the `_external` flag.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly parse the `uri` and extract parameters based on the view name and the provided keyword arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        if value is not None:
            if key in uri:
                uri = uri.replace("<" + key + ">", str(value))
            else:
                if "?" in uri:
                    uri += "&"
                else:
                    uri += "?"
                uri += key + "=" + str(value)

    if "_external" in kwargs and kwargs["_external"]:
        if route.host:
            scheme = "http" if route.is_http else "https"
            netloc = route.get_host()
        else:
            netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")

    if netloc:
        out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, uri, "", "", ""))
    else:
        out = uri

    return out
```

This corrected function properly handles the parsing of the `uri` and the keyword arguments, and properly constructs the URL based on the provided view name and parameters.
