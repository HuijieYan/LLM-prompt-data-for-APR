The bug in the `url_for` function comes from the section where the function builds the URL based on the view name and the values provided. In particular, the issue arises when the function is dealing with blueprint routes with a host.

The problem occurs because when constructing the URL for blueprint routes with a host, the host is being wrongly concatenated as part of the path instead of being used as a hostname. This results in incorrect URLs being returned.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` function should be modified to correctly handle blueprint routes with a host. Specifically, the function needs to consider the blueprint's host as the hostname and use the config's server name as a default when necessary. Additionally, the function should ensure that for internal URLs, only the path is returned, while for external URLs, a fully qualified domain name with the full path is returned.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # existing code

    # ... (previous code remains the same)

    external = kwargs.pop("_external", False)
    netloc = kwargs.pop("_server", None)
    if netloc is None and external:
        netloc = self.router.hosts[0] 

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

In this correction, the `netloc` variable is being set to use the first host from the `router` object when it's required, and the construction of the final URL is appropriately using `netloc` as the hostname when `_external` is True. This ensures that the correct URLs are constructed for blueprint routes with a host.
