The error occurs in the `url_for` function, specifically when the `view_name` is "hostindex" and the external is False. The expected output should be "/", but the function returns "example.com".

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the host parameter and the external parameter. The function fails to correctly handle the host parameter when the external parameter is False.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the host parameter is correctly handled and that the external parameter has the desired effect on the generated URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code)

    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    # special static files url_for
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    host = route.get("host", None)
    if host:
        uri = f"{host}{uri}"

    # rest of the code remains the same

    return out
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to retrieve the host from the route and prepend it to the URI if it exists. This ensures that the host parameter is correctly handled.
