The bug occurs when using blueprints with the host argument and trying to get a URL with url_for. The incorrect URL is returned - the blueprint's host is used as a path and not as a hostname.

The issue is likely occurring within the url_for method, specifically when handling blueprints with the host argument. The function does not correctly generate the URL using the supplied host and endpoint, resulting in an incorrect URL being returned.

To fix the bug, the url_for function should be updated to correctly handle blueprints with the host argument. This likely involves modifying the logic for building the URL based on the blueprint's host and endpoint. Additionally, the construction of the fully qualified domain name for external URLs should be handled properly.

The corrected code for the url_for method is as follows:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # existing code...

    # find the route by the supplied view name
    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kwargs)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    filename = kwargs.pop("filename", None)
    if uri != "/" and uri.endswith("/"):
        uri = uri[:-1]

    out = uri

    # construct the fully qualified domain name for external URLs
    external = kwargs.pop("_external", False)
    if external:
        scheme = kwargs.pop("_scheme", "")
        if not scheme:
            netloc = kwargs.pop("_server", None)
            if netloc is None:
                netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")
            if "://" not in netloc:
                netloc = "http://" + netloc
            out = netloc + uri

    # construct the query string
    query_string = urlencode(kwargs, doseq=True) if kwargs else ""
    out += "?" + query_string if query_string else ""

    return out
```

This corrected code should address the issue of generating incorrect URLs for blueprints with host arguments and provide the expected behavior as described in the issue.
