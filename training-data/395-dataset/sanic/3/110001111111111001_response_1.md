The error occurs in the `url_for` function of the `app.py` file. The expected output for the "hostindex" view name is "/", but the actual output is "example.com", causing the assertion error.

The issue is that when the view name is "hostindex", the `kw` dictionary is not being updated with the `host` value from the route. As a result, the `uri` retains the value of the host, leading to the incorrect URL construction.

To fix this, the `url_for` function needs to correctly handle different scenarios based on the view name and update the `kw` dictionary accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    # special static files url_for
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    if view_name == "static" or view_name.endswith(".static"):
        filename = kwargs.pop("filename", None)
        if "<file_uri:" in uri:
            folder_ = uri.split("<file_uri:", 1)[0]
            if folder_.endswith("/"):
                folder_ = folder_[:-1]

            if filename.startswith("/"):
                filename = filename[1:]

            uri = "{}/{}".format(folder_, filename)

    if uri != "/" and uri.endswith("/"):
        uri = uri[:-1]

    out = uri

    # check if the route has a host defined and update kw dictionary if present
    if route.host:
        kw['host'] = route.host

    # rest of the code for handling query string, _external, _server, _scheme, etc.
    # ...

    return out
```

In the corrected code, we update the `kw` dictionary with the host value from the route if it's present. This allows for the correct construction of the URL based on the view name and other parameters.
