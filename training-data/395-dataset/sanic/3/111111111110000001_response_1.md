The error message from the test function indicates that the URL generated for the "hostindex" route is not as expected. The actual URL generated is 'example.com' while the expected URL is '/'. This suggests that there is a bug in the `url_for` method specifically related to routes with hosts.

Upon inspecting the `url_for` method, it appears that the bug might be related to the extraction of the host parameter while building the URL. The issue might be within the section of the method where it handles the `host` parameter, especially when the `_external` flag is set to `True`.

The bug might be occurring because the `url_for` method is not correctly building the URL with the specified host when the `_external` flag is set to `True`. This might be due to improper handling of the `scheme`, `netloc`, and `host` parameters within the method.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` method needs to correctly handle the `host` parameter and build the URL with the specified host when the `_external` flag is set to `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlunparse

def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external=False, **kwargs):
    # ...  (other code remains unchanged)

    if _external:
        scheme = "http"  # Default to HTTP if not specified
        netloc = "example.com"  # Default domain, replace with actual domain
        if 'host' in kwargs:
            netloc = kwargs.pop('host')  # Override with specified host
    else:
        scheme = ""
        netloc = ""

    # ... (remaining code unchanged)

    # scheme://netloc/path;parameters?query#fragment
    out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

In this corrected code, when the `_external` flag is set to `True`, the `scheme` and `netloc` are properly handled to build the URL with the correct `host` specified in the `kwargs`. This should fix the bug and generate the correct URLs for routes with hosts.
