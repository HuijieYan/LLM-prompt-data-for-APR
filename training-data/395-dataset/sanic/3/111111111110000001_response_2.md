The error occurs when the `url_for` function is called with the view name "hostindex", it is returning "example.com" instead of "/".

The potential error lies in the logic of matching the view name and extracting the URI from the router. It seems that the `find_route_by_view_name` method is not correctly identifying the URI for the given view name, leading to the incorrect output.

The bug occurs due to a misinterpretation of the view name and its corresponding URI. It seems that the code is not correctly identifying the route associated with the view name "hostindex" and returning the host name instead of the URI.

To fix the bug, the code logic for extracting the URI from the router based on the view name needs to be reviewed and possibly modified. It could also involve checking the route matching and extraction logic within the `find_route_by_view_name` method to ensure it returns the correct URI for the given view name.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `url_for`:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external=False, **kwargs):
    uri, _ = self.router.get_route_uri(view_name)
    if not uri:
        raise URLBuildError("Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name))

    for k, v in kwargs.items():
        uri = uri.replace("<{}>".format(k), str(v))

    if _external:
        return self.config.SERVER_NAME + uri
    else:
        return uri
```

In this corrected function, the `get_route_uri` method is used to directly obtain the URI for the given view name. Then, the function iterates through the keyword arguments and replaces the corresponding placeholders in the URI with the provided values. Finally, if `_external` is True, it appends the server name to the URI and returns the complete URL.
