The test function `test_routes_with_host` is checking the output of the `app.url_for()` function for different routes with and without host specified. The error message indicates that the `app.url_for("hostindex")` call is returning "example.com" instead of "/".

The bug occurs in the `url_for` function due to the handling of routes with host specified. When the `view_name` corresponds to a route with a specified host, the function is not correctly identifying and handling such routes, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to be updated to properly handle routes with hosts. It should extract the appropriate URI path based on the `view_name` and the specified host.

Updated/Copied Code:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    ...

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    if 'host' in route._methods and kwargs.get('_external'):
        uri = route.uri
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
