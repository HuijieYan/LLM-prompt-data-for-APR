The error occurs in the `url_for` function where it fails to properly handle routes with a host argument. When the `url_for` function is called with the view_name "hostindex", it returns "example.com" instead of "/" as expected. This is an incorrect behavior when working with blueprints and host-based routes.

The bug occurs because the `url_for` function doesn't properly handle routes with the host argument, leading to incorrect URLs being generated. This is due to the incorrect parsing of host-based routes and improper construction of the URL.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to properly handle routes with the host argument, and construct the URLs based on the provided host information and route paths.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external=False, _server=None, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.
    
    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.
    
    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.
    
    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param _external: whether to generate an absolute URL
    :param _server: the server information to be used for the URL
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.
    
    :return: the built URL
    
    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kwargs)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    if _external:
        if not _server:
            _server = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")

        scheme = "http" if "://" not in _server[:8] else ""

        netloc = _server.split("://", 1)[-1]

        if uri != "/" and uri.endswith("/"):
            uri = uri[:-1]
        
        if route.host:
            netloc = route.host

        url = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, uri, "", "", ""))
    else:
        url = uri

    return url
```

This corrected function properly handles the generation of URLs based on the view name, and takes into account the host information provided in the route. It also supports generating absolute URLs when `_external` is set to `True` and `_server` is provided.
