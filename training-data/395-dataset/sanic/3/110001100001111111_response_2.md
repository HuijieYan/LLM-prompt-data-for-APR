The bug seems to be occurring in the `url_for` method of the `Sanic` class. The issue is related to blueprint routes with the `host` argument not returning the correct URL when using the `url_for` method. The expected behavior is to return the correct URLs for internal and external routes based on the hostname and path specified in the blueprint.

The bug appears to be caused by the handling of host-based routes in the `url_for` method, where it doesn't correctly construct the URL based on the host and path specified in the blueprint.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` method should be updated to correctly handle the construction of URLs for blueprint routes with the `host` argument. This may involve ensuring that the host and path are properly concatenated to form the correct URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code)

    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    # special static files url_for
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # Updated logic to handle host-based routes
    if route.host:
        uri = f"{route.host}/{uri.lstrip('/')}"

    # Rest of the code as is

    # ... (existing code)
```

In the corrected code, the `url_for` method has been updated to handle host-based routes by concatenating the `route.host` with the path `uri` to construct the correct URL.

This should address the issue with blueprint routes with the `host` argument not returning the correct URLs when using the `url_for` method.
