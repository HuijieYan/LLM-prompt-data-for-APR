The error occurs when calling the `url_for` function on the `app` object for the view names `hostindex` and `hostpath`. The expected behavior is that calling `app.url_for("hostindex")` should return `"/"` and `app.url_for("hostpath")` should return `"/path"`. However, the actual returned values are incorrect, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is likely in the section where it handles the `host` parameter. The bug may occur due to incorrect handling of the `host` parameter and its relationship with the view name.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to correctly handle the `host` parameter that is provided in the view route definitions.

Here is the corrected `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    # append host if available and not external
    if "host" in kwargs and "_external" not in kwargs:
        host = kwargs.pop("host")
        if host:
            out = f"{host}{out}"

    # ... omitted code ...
```

In this corrected function, the `host` parameter is handled correctly and added to the URL when it is available and not marked as external. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
