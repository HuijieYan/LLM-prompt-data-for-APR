The issue occurs in the `url_for` function, where the `scheme` is set to an empty string and `netloc` is not being correctly handled. This leads to incorrect URLs being generated, especially when the `_external` argument is set to `True`.

To fix the bug, the `scheme` should be set to `"http"` by default, and the `netloc` should be constructed using the host from the blueprint. Additionally, when the `_external` argument is `True`, the `netloc` should take precedence over the `SERVER_NAME` in the config.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlencode, urlunparse
import re
from typing import Dict

class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
        r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.
    
        In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
        keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
        specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
        `URLBuildError` will be thrown.
    
        Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
        the output URL's query string.
    
        :param view_name: string referencing the view name
        :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
            parameters and query string arguments.
    
        :return: the built URL
    
        Raises:
            URLBuildError
        """
        # ... omitted code ...

        scheme = kwargs.pop("_scheme", "http")  # Set 'http' as default scheme

        netloc = kwargs.pop("_server", None)
        if netloc is None and external:
            netloc = self.router.host

        if external:
            netloc = self.router.host
            if not scheme:
                scheme = "http"

            if "://" not in netloc:  # Check if the scheme is not included in the netloc
                netloc = f"{scheme}://{netloc}"
    
        # ... omitted code ...

        # scheme://netloc/path;parameters?query#fragment
        out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))
    
        return out
```

This corrected function sets the default scheme to "http", correctly handles the `netloc` value based on the blueprint's host, and handles the `_external` argument to construct the URL appropriately.
