The bug seems to be in the `url_for` function. In the given buggy function, the logic for building the URL based on the view name and the provided values seems to be correct. The issue might be in the actual retrieval of the `uri` and `route` values using `self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)`.

Based on the provided input and expected output, the `uri` and `route` values are incorrectly derived in the given buggy cases.

The base issue appears to be with the processing of the `view_name` and consequent lookup of the URI and route. It seems like the view name might not be correctly matched with the expected route, which is causing unexpected URIs and routes to be used in building the URL.

To fix this bug, the code logic for finding the route by the supplied view name needs to be reviewed. Correctly identifying and matching the view names to their corresponding routes, and retrieving the URI and route information would likely resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function based on the analysis:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kwargs)  # Updated line to correctly pass kwargs
    # ... existing code ...

    return out
```
