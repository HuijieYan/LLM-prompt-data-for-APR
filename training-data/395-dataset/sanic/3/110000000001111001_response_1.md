The bug in the given function `url_for` seems related to the identification of the view name by the supplied parameter and the route values. It appears that the route is being identified incorrectly, or the view name is not being mapped to the correct route.

One possible cause for the bug could be related to the incorrect identification of the view name in the `self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)` call, where `view_name` is passed as an argument. Another potential cause could be the incorrect parsing or matching of parameters against the URL pattern.

To fix this bug, it would be necessary to review the logic used to identify the route based on the view name and the corresponding parameters. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the parsing and matching logic for the parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... (prior logic remains unchanged)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kwargs)
    
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # Rest of the existing logic follows from here
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, the potential bug related to route identification has been addressed. As the earlier code segment didn't provide details about the specific error messages, it's recommended to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure that the bug has been fixed. If there are still issues, further investigation into parameter parsing and matching may be required.
