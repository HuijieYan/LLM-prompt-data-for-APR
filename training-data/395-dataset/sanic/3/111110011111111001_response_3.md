The error occurs in the `url_for` function. The bug seems to stem from the way the function is building the URL for routes with a specified host. The actual behavior does not match the expected behavior, as evidenced by the failed test case.

Upon examining the provided information, it appears that the bug occurs when trying to build URLs for routes with a specified host. 

The reason for the bug is that the function is not properly handling routes with specified hosts, which causes it to return unexpected values. Specifically, the function is not correctly handling the scenario where routes have specified hosts, leading to incorrect URL generation.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to handle routes with specified hosts correctly, ensuring that the URL is built based on the specified host when necessary.

The corrected code for the `url_for` function is as follows:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    out = uri

    # Handle routes with specified hosts
    if route.host:
        host = route.host
    elif "host" in kwargs:
        host = kwargs.pop("host")
    else:
        host = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")

    # ... existing code for building the URL ...

    return out
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `url_for` function properly handles routes with specified hosts. If the route has a specified host, it uses that host for building the URL. Otherwise, it falls back to checking the `host` key in the `kwargs`. If neither is available, it uses the server's default host specified in the config. This should address the issue and align the function's behavior with the expected outcomes.
