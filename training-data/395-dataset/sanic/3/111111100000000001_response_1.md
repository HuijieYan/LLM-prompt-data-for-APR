The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)`.

The bug is occurring because the function `self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)` is not implemented or defined. This is causing the function to fail and raise a `NameError` since `router` is not defined within the `url_for` function.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `find_route_by_view_name` method for the `router` object in the `url_for` function, which should return the URI and route for the given `view_name`.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    # find the route by the supplied view name
    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kwargs)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
