The issue here seems to be with the `url_for` method in the `Sanic` class. When dealing with blueprints with a `host` argument and trying to get a URL with `url_for`, an incorrect URL is being returned. The blueprint's host is being used as a path, rather than as a hostname.

The error location seems to be within the `url_for` method, specifically in the logic that handles the hostname and path.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling the hostname and path in the `url_for` method is not correctly differentiating between them, resulting in the incorrect URL construction.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `url_for` method to correctly handle the `host` argument when constructing the URL. This would involve differentiating between internal and external URLs, and using the `host` argument appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... existing logic ...

    external = kwargs.pop("_external", False)
    host = kwargs.pop("_host", None)

    if external:
        netloc = host if host else self.config.get("SERVER_NAME")
        scheme = kwargs.pop("_scheme", "http")
        # construct the URL with fully qualified domain name and full path
        out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, uri, "", query_string, anchor))
    else:
        out = uri  # for internal URLs, only return the path

    return out
```

In this corrected code, we have added the handling of the `host` argument for both internal and external URLs. If the URL is external, the `host` and `scheme` are used to construct the fully qualified URL. If it's internal, only the path is returned.
