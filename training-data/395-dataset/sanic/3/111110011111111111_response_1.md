The error occurs when using the `url_for` function to generate URLs for routes defined within a Sanic application, specifically when routes are defined with a host argument. The function does not handle the host argument properly, leading to incorrect URLs being generated.

The bug seems to originate from the `url_for` function's handling of routes with a host argument. When generating the URL, the function should include the host information in the resulting URL, but it is not doing so correctly. This results in URLs that use the host information as part of the path, rather than as the hostname.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to properly handle routes with a host argument. When generating the URL for such routes, it should include the host information as part of the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the resulting URL.

Below is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # existing code ...

    if route.host is not None:  # Check if the route has a host
        netloc = route.host  # Use the host information for the netloc in the URL
    else:
        netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")  # Use the server name from config as default if no host is specified

    # existing code ...
    
    # construct the URL with the updated netloc
    out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

In this fix, we check if the route has a host specified. If it does, we use that host information as part of the netloc in the URL. If no host is specified, we fall back to using the server name from the config as the default.

This should address the issue of incorrectly generated URLs for routes with a host argument. The corrected function should now properly include the host information when generating the URL, resulting in the expected behavior.
