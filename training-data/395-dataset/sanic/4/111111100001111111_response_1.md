The bug occurs in the `url_for` function of the `Request` class. The function checks for the presence of `SERVER_NAME` in the configuration, which is causing the `KeyError` when the `url_for` function is called. This behavior changed in version 19.9.0 of Sanic.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to be modified to handle the case where `SERVER_NAME` is not present in the configuration. It should use the `host` and `port` from the request properties instead of trying to access `SERVER_NAME` directly.

Here's the corrected version of the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

This updated function uses `self.server_name` and `self.server_port` to construct the `netloc` instead of relying on `SERVER_NAME` in the configuration. This change should resolve the `KeyError` issue when calling the `url_for` function.
