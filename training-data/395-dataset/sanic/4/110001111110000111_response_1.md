The error is occurring in the `test_url_for_without_server_name` test function. The error message indicates that the response object is of type `NoneType`, which is causing a `TypeError` when trying to access its `json` attribute.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `url_for` method. The error message indicates that the `SERVER_NAME` is not being found in the `app.config`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `url_for` method is attempting to access the `SERVER_NAME` property directly from the `app.config` without considering the possibility that it might not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `url_for` method to handle cases where `SERVER_NAME` might not be present in the `app.config`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the response object in the test function is not None before accessing its attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME", ""):
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

With this correction, the `url_for` method will first check if `SERVER_NAME` exists in the `app.config` before accessing it. If it doesn't exist, it will default to an empty string. This modification will prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the response object is not None before accessing its attributes in the test function. This can be achieved by adding a simple check for `response` being not None before asserting its attributes.
