The error is occurring because the `SERVER_NAME` attribute is not found in the `self.app.config` dictionary. This is leading to a `KeyError` when the `url_for` function is trying to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`.

The potential error location is within the `url_for` function where it tries to access the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from the `self.app.config` dictionary.

The bug is occurring because the `url_for` function is trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` attribute directly from the `self.app.config` dictionary, but it is not present. This is causing the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can update the `url_for` function to use the host and port directly from the `self` object, without trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from `self.app.config`.

Here is the corrected function for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected function, we are directly using the `scheme`, `host`, and `port` attributes from the `self` object to determine the `netloc` without accessing the `SERVER_NAME` from the `self.app.config` dictionary. This should fix the bug and prevent the KeyError from occurring.
