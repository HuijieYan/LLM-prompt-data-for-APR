The error message indicates a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`, which means that somewhere in the code, a method is being called on a `None` object, which does not support such operations. This suggests that the `url_for` function in the `Request` class is returning `None` instead of the expected string URL.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is in the line `return self.app.url_for(...)`, where the return value of `self.app.url_for(...)` is not being handled correctly.

The reason behind this bug is that the `url_for` function is not returning the expected URL. This could be due to problems in determining the `scheme` and `netloc`, which are then used to generate the URL.

To fix this bug, we can refactor the code to properly handle the determination of scheme and netloc based on the request. We can also ensure that the `url_for` function returns the correct absolute URL to the given view.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    scheme = self.scheme()
    host = self.host()
    port = self.port()

    netloc = f"{host}:{port}" if port else host

    return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs)
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that we are retrieving the correct `scheme`, `host`, and `port` values by calling the related functions, and then use these values to generate the `netloc`. Finally, we return the result of `self.app.url_for` with the correct parameters.
