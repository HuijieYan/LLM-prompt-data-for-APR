The test case is attempting to compare the value of `response.json["url"]` with a predefined URL. The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to a 'NoneType' object not being subscriptable. This suggests that the `response.json["url"]` is resolving to `None` instead of a dictionary.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is likely in the `return self.app.url_for(...)` or `return self.app.url_for(...)` statements. The function is not returning the expected value.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the URL generation within the `url_for` function. The function is not returning the expected absolute URL.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `url_for` function to correctly generate the absolute URL based on the provided input parameters, and ensure it returns the expected value.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    url = self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
    return url
```

With this corrected code, the `url_for` function should now correctly generate and return the absolute URL, resolving the issue with the test case and the error message.
