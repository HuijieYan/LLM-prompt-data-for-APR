The error is likely occurring because the `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is not defined. This causes a KeyError when trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` in the config attribute.

To fix the bug, we should update the `url_for` method to use the `host` and `port` from the request object directly, rather than attempting to access it from the config object.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.request.host
    port = self.request.port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, we are directly accessing the `host` and `port` from the `self.request` object, which should be available in the context of the request. This eliminates the need to access the `SERVER_NAME` from the config object, which was causing the KeyError.
