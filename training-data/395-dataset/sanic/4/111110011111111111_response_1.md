The error occurs because the `Request` class has two `url_for` functions with the same signature, which causes conflicts and leads to the incorrect function being called. This results in the wrong URL being generated and the `response.json["url"]` being `None`, leading to a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` error.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate `url_for` function and have only one implementation of the function in the `Request` class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = "http"  # Assume default scheme is http
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = f"{host}:{port}"

    return f"{scheme}://{netloc}/{view_name}"  # Generate the absolute URL
```

By removing the duplicate function and implementing the correct logic to generate the absolute URL, we can avoid the KeyError and the TypeError that occur in the original implementation.

These changes will fix the bug and ensure that the `url_for` function generates the correct absolute URL as expected.
