The error message from the test function indicates a 'NoneType' error, which suggests that the 'url_for' method is returning None instead of the expected result.

The potential error in the problematic function is likely in the conditional block where it checks if "//" is in the SERVER_NAME configuration. This check may not correctly handle the condition, leading to a None return value.

The bug is occurring because the method is trying to access the SERVER_NAME configuration directly from the app.config, which may not be defined or accessible in certain scenarios, leading to the KeyError.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use the request's 'host' attribute to determine the scheme and network location (netloc) instead of directly accessing the SERVER_NAME configuration. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the situation where the 'port' is not explicitly provided.

Here's the corrected code for the 'url_for' method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes the same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute URL to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, we use the 'host' attribute to determine the network location (netloc) and we use the 'scheme' attribute directly, avoiding direct access to the SERVER_NAME configuration. Additionally, we handle the situation where the port may not be explicitly provided.
