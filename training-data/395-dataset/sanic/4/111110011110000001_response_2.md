The error message indicates a 'NoneType' error, suggesting that the response.json["url"] is trying to access a value from a NoneType object, which is not subscriptable.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the url_for method. This is because the error message is related to the url_for function not generating the expected URL.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely that the url_for method is not correctly determining the scheme and netloc based on the request, leading to the incorrect generation of the absolute URL.

To fix the bug, the url_for method should correctly determine the scheme and netloc based on the request. Additionally, it should handle the case when the SERVER_NAME contains "//" and adjust the netloc accordingly. The correct URL should be constructed using the scheme, server_name, server_port, and the provided view_name and kwargs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        netloc = self.app.config.SERVER_NAME
    elif (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return "{scheme}://{netloc}/{view_name}".format(
        scheme=scheme, netloc=netloc, view_name=view_name
    )
```
This corrected code first checks if the SERVER_NAME contains "//" and uses it as the netloc. If not, it determines the netloc based on the scheme and port, and then constructs the absolute URL using the scheme, netloc, and the provided view_name.
