The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect usage of `self.app.url_for` to generate the absolute URL. 

The bug occurs because the code first checks if the `SERVER_NAME` parameter in the `config` attribute of the `app` object contains "//", and if it does, it directly generates the URL using `self.app.url_for` without considering the scheme and netloc. This can lead to incorrect URLs being generated.

To fix the bug, we need to consider the scheme and netloc based on the request, and then generate the URL using `self.app.url_for` with the correct scheme and netloc parameters.

Corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` based on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, we are determining the scheme and netloc based on the request and then using `self.app.url_for` to generate the absolute URL with the correct scheme and netloc parameters. This will ensure that the correct URL is generated based on the request.
