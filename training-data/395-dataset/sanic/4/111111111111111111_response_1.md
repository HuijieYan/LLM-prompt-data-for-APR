The error occurs in the `url_for` function of the `Request` class. The error is caused by the use of `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`, which is not defined and leads to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the reference to `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` and instead use the information available in the `Request` class to construct the URL.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = self.host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(self.host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, we use `self.scheme`, `self.host`, and `self.server_port` to construct the URL. This ensures that the URL is generated based on the request properties without relying on an external configuration such as `SERVER_NAME`.
