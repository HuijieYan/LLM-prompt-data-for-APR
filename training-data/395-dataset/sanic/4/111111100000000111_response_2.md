The bug is occurring in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class. The error message indicates that the `SERVER_NAME` is not found in the `app.config`. This suggests that the code is trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` from the app's configuration, but it's not present.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is trying to access the server name from the app's configuration directly, which may not exist in every case. It should rather be accessed from the request object.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` method should retrieve the server name from the `Host` header in the request, which contains the domain information. The port should also be retrieved from the request, as the `server_port` method is already present for that purpose.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected implementation, the server name is retrieved from the `host` attribute of the request object, and the port is retrieved from the `server_port` method of the request object.

This should resolve the issue of accessing `SERVER_NAME` from the app's configuration and generate the correct URL based on the request details.
