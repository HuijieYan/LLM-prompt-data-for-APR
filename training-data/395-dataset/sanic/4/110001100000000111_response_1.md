1. The error occurs when running Sanic behind a proxy and trying to generate a URL using `request.url_for()`. The error message indicates that the `SERVER_NAME` is not configured in the app's config, and this is causing a KeyError when the `url_for` function tries to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`.

2. The potential error location within the `url_for` function is the line `if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:` where it is attempting to access `SERVER_NAME` from the app's configuration. 

3. The bug occurs because the `SERVER_NAME` configuration is required to generate a full URL with the given path, but it is not configured and causes a KeyError when the `url_for` function tries to access it.

4. The bug can be fixed by checking if the `SERVER_NAME` configuration is available and using it to generate the full URL. If it is not available, fallback to the existing behavior.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    if "SERVER_NAME" in self.app.config:
        scheme = self.scheme
        host = self.server_name
        port = self.server_port

        if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
            scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
        ):
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        return self.app.url_for(
            view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
        )
    else:
        # Fallback behavior if SERVER_NAME is not configured
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)
```

This corrected code checks for the presence of `SERVER_NAME` in the app's configuration. If it is available, it uses it to generate the full URL as before. If not, it falls back to the existing behavior. This should resolve the KeyError when the `url_for` function tries to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` and provide a full URL with the given path in both scenarios.
