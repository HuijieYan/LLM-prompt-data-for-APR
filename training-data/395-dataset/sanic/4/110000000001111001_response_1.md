Potential Error Location:
The error might be occurring in the calculation of the netloc variable based on the scheme, host, and port. The condition to check for the scheme and port combination may not be working as expected.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug might be occurring because the conditions to determine the netloc based on the scheme and port combination are not correctly handling the comparisons. This could result in an incorrect netloc being generated.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition to check for the scheme and port combination. Ensure that the comparisons are correctly handling the different combinations of scheme and port values.
2. Double-check the logic for determining the netloc based on the scheme and port, and make necessary adjustments to ensure that the correct netloc is calculated.

The Corrected Code:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the logic for determining the netloc based on the scheme and port has been reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the correct netloc is calculated.
