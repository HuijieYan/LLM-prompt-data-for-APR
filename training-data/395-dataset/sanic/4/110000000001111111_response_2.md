The error is occurring in the `url_for` function. It seems that the function is trying to access `SERVER_NAME` from the configuration but it's not available, leading to a KeyError.

The bug is occurring due to the code attempting to access `SERVER_NAME` directly from the app's configuration without checking if it's available. This is likely the cause of the KeyError when `SERVER_NAME` is not present in the configuration.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if `SERVER_NAME` is available in the app's configuration and handle the case where it's not present gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    if "SERVER_NAME" in self.app.config:
        server_name = self.app.config.SERVER_NAME
        if "//" in server_name:
            return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

This corrected code first checks if `SERVER_NAME` is available in the app's configuration. If it is, the function proceeds with the earlier logic. If `SERVER_NAME` is not available, it skips the part that requires `SERVER_NAME` and proceeds with the remaining logic to generate the URL.
