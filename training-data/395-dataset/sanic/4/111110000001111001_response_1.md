The buggy function `url_for` is trying to generate an absolute URL based on the request's properties such as scheme, host, and port. However, it is failing to do so due to incorrectly handling the conditional logic for determining the `netloc` (combination of host and port).

The bug occurs in the conditional logic that checks the scheme and port. The bug lies in the condition where it checks if the scheme is 'http' or 'ws' and the port is 80, or if the scheme is 'https' or 'wss' and the port is 443. If any of these conditions are true, it sets the `netloc` to only the host, and otherwise, it combines the host and port.

To fix this bug, we should update the conditional logic to correctly determine the `netloc` based on the combination of scheme and port.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
# corrected url_for function
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, we removed the unnecessary check for the double forward slash in the server name as it is not relevant in this context. We then updated the conditional logic to correctly determine the `netloc` based on the combination of scheme and port. After that, the function returns the absolute URL based on the corrected `netloc` and other parameters.
