The error in the `url_for` function occurs due to the usage of `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` which is not defined, leading to a KeyError. This is causing the function to fail when trying to generate a full URL with the given path.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case where `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is not defined. We can use the `self.host` and `self.port` values instead to construct the netloc for the URL. If the `scheme` is 'http' and the `port` is 80, or if the `scheme` is 'https' and the `port` is 443, then the `netloc` should only include the `host`. Otherwise, it should include both `host` and `port`.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port
    scheme = self.scheme

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
            scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the function will use `self.host` and `self.port` to construct the `netloc` for the URL, and the KeyError related to `SERVER_NAME` will be resolved.
