The error seems to be occurring in the `test_url_for_without_server_name` function. The error message indicates that response.json is of type None, and therefore not subscriptable. This error could be related to the incorrect implementation of the `url_for` function where it is failing to return the expected URL.

The problem in the `url_for` function seems to be the incorrect handling of the `app.url_for` call. The function should automatically determine the `scheme` and `netloc` based on the request, but it's currently returning None instead of the expected URL.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `app.url_for` call within the `url_for` function returns the correct absolute URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return f"{scheme}://{netloc}{self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)}"
```

In the corrected code, I replaced the `return self.app.url_for(...)` line with a formatted string that constructs the absolute URL based on the determined `scheme` and `netloc`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `url_for` function returns the correct absolute URL.
