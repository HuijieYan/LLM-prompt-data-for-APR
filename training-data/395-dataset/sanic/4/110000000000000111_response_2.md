The error message "AttributeError: Config has no 'SERVER_NAME'" and the associated detailed issue description indicate that the issue lies in the `url_for` method of the `request` object in the Sanic library. The error is occurring when trying to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` within the `url_for` method.

The bug occurs because the `SERVER_NAME` configuration variable is missing or not defined in the Sanic application configuration. This can lead to a KeyError when trying to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` within the `url_for` method.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` method should check if the `SERVER_NAME` configuration variable is defined before attempting to use it. If it is not defined, default behavior or alternative behavior should be provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Check if SERVER_NAME is in app.config
    if "SERVER_NAME" in self.app.config and self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
            return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    # If SERVER_NAME is not defined
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `SERVER_NAME` is defined in the app configuration. If it is defined, it follows the existing logic. If it is not defined, it defaults to using the host and port from the request environment.

This should prevent the KeyError when `SERVER_NAME` is not defined in the app configuration and provide a workaround for cases where the server is running behind a proxy without hardcoding the hostname.
