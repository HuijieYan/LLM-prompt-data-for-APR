The buggy function `url_for` is trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from the `config` of the app, but it's not available in the current context. This causes a `KeyError` when trying to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`, which leads to a `NoneType` error when trying to use `app.test_client.port` in the test case.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `url_for` function to use the `host` attribute of the request object instead of accessing `SERVER_NAME` from the `config`. The `host` attribute provides the necessary information for building the URL.

Here's the corrected `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
        """
        Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
        `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
        to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

        :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
        :return: an absolute url to the given view
        :rtype: str
        """
        scheme = self.scheme
        host = self.host
        port = self.server_port

        if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
            scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
        ):
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        return self.app.url_for(
            view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
        )
```

By using the `host` attribute of the request instead of trying to access `SERVER_NAME` from the `config`, the bug should be fixed, and the test case should pass without errors.
