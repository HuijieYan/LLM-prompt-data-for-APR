The error message states that there is a KeyError for 'SERVER_NAME' in the `url_for` method. This suggests that the issue is with accessing the SERVER_NAME from the config.

The issue is occurring because the `url_for` method is trying to access `SERVER_NAME` from the application config, but it's not available, leading to the KeyError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle the case where `SERVER_NAME` is not present in the config. We can also make sure that the `url_for` method works correctly when the server is running behind a proxy.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    if "//" in self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME"):
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    host = self.host
    port = self.port

    if self.scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80:
        netloc = host
    elif self.scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443:
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=self.scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, we use the `get` method to access `SERVER_NAME` from the config to avoid KeyError if it's not present. We also use `self.host` and `self.port` to determine the host and port when building the URL.
