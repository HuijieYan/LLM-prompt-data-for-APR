The error message indicates that the response.json object is of type 'NoneType', which means that response.json is returning None instead of a valid dictionary. This suggests that the issue lies within the url_for function, which is responsible for generating the URL.

The buggy function tries to determine the scheme, host, and port to construct the URL. However, it assumes that the SERVER_NAME variable is present in self.app.config, which is causing the KeyError. This assumption is incorrect and is leading to the generation of an incorrect URL.

To fix the bug, the function should not rely on the SERVER_NAME variable for generating the URL. Instead, it should use the values available in the Request object and the app object to construct the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.
    
    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host
    port = self.port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
            scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    url = self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
    return url
```
In this corrected code, the function uses self.host instead of self.server_name, and self.port instead of self.server_port to construct the netloc. It also removes the conditional check for "//" in SERVER_NAME. This should generate the correct URL based on the available request information.
