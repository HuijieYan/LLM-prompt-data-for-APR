The problematic function is `url_for` inside the `Request` class. The function tries to determine the `netloc` based on the request, but there are issues with how the `netloc` is being determined.

The function is failing because it is not returning anything (the default behavior of a Python function when there is no explicit return statement is to return `None`). This causes an error when the test function tries to access `response.json["url"]`, as `response.json` is `None`.

The function should calculate the `netloc` and return the absolute URL to the given view.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    netloc = self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME")
    if netloc:
        _external = True
        scheme = self.scheme
        if self.server_port in (80, 443):
            netloc = "{}://{}".format(scheme, netloc)
        else:
            netloc = "{}://{}:{}".format(scheme, netloc, self.server_port)
    else:
        _external = False
        netloc = None

    return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=_external, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `netloc` is calculated based on the `SERVER_NAME` configuration from the app, and the `_external` flag is set accordingly.
- The `scheme` is determined from the request's scheme.
- The correct absolute URL is then returned using `self.app.url_for` with the calculated parameters.

This should fix the issue and allow the test function to pass without errors.
