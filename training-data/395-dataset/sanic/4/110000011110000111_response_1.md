The error message indicates that the 'response.json' is of type 'NoneType', meaning that the 'url' key is not present in the 'response.json' dictionary. This implies that the 'request.url_for' method is not working as expected, leading to a KeyError and returning 'None' instead of the expected URL. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the SERVER_NAME configuration. The function is trying to access the SERVER_NAME from the app config, and if it is not present, it is throwing a KeyError.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to retrieve the SERVER_NAME from the app config directly, which might not be available in certain setups. Additionally, the logic for determining the netloc based on the scheme and port seems error-prone.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for the presence of the SERVER_NAME in the app config and provide a fallback or default behavior if it's not present. Additionally, the logic for determining the netloc based on the scheme and port should be reviewed.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    if self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME"):  # Check if SERVER_NAME is present in app config
        netloc = self.app.config.SERVER_NAME
    else:
        netloc = f"127.0.0.1:{self.port}"  # Fallback to default host and port

    scheme = self.scheme

    return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the SERVER_NAME is present in the app config using the `get` method, and if it's not present, we fallback to a default host and port. This ensures that the function can generate the URL even if the SERVER_NAME is not explicitly configured. Additionally, the scheme and netloc determination logic has been simplified to address potential issues.

By following these changes, the 'url_for' method should work as expected, and the test case should pass without any errors.
