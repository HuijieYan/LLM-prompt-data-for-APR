The potential error in the function `url_for` is caused by the use of `self.app` without it being defined within the class. This suggests that the function is likely part of a web framework such as Flask or Sanic, where `self.app` should refer to the application instance, but it has not been initialized or passed as an argument to the class.

To fix the bug, `self.app` needs to be properly initialized within the class, either as a constructor argument or through another method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Request():
    """
    Properties of an HTTP request such as URL, headers, etc.
    """

    def __init__(self, app):
        self.app = app

    # ... other omitted code ...

    def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
        """
        Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
        `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
        to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

        :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
        :return: an absolute url to the given view
        :rtype: str
        """
        # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
        if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
            return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

        scheme = self.scheme()
        host = self.server_name()
        port = self.server_port()

        if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
                scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
        ):
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        return self.app.url_for(
            view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
        )
```
