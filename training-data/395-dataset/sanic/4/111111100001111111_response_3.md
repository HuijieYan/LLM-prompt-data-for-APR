The error occurs in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class. The error message indicates that the `SERVER_NAME` variable is missing in the config, leading to a KeyError when trying to access it in the `url_for` method.

The reason for this bug is that the `url_for` method is trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` variable directly from the config, but it should be obtained from the request object.

To fix the bug, the `SERVER_NAME` should be obtained from the request object instead of the app's config. This change will ensure that the `SERVER_NAME` is available and can be used to generate the URL as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    if "//" in self.server_name:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this correction, the `SERVER_NAME` has been replaced with `self.server_name`, which is obtained from the request object itself. This ensures that the `SERVER_NAME` is available and prevents the KeyError.
