The error is occurring because the `url_for` function is trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` attribute of the `app.config` but it is not present, resulting in a `KeyError`. This is causing the function to return `None`, which leads to the `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` when trying to access the `json` attribute in the test function.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` function needs to be updated to handle the case where `SERVER_NAME` is not present in the configuration. It should use the request's `scheme`, `server_name`, and `server_port` to generate the URL instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name()
    port = self.server_port()

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

With these changes, the `url_for` function will use the request's attributes to determine the `scheme` and `netloc` without relying on the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from the configuration.

This should resolve the `KeyError: 'SERVER_NAME'` issue and the subsequent `TypeError` in the test function.
