The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the netloc variable. The port is being cast to a string and combined with the host without considering the case where the port is equal to 80 or 443.

The bug occurs because the condition for checking if the port is equal to 80 or 443 is not properly handled. The netloc should only include the port if it's not the default port for the given scheme.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to properly check for the default port values and adjust the construction of the netloc variable accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port != 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port != 443
    ):
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)
    else:
        netloc = host

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the condition for checking the default port values has been adjusted to properly include or exclude the port in the netloc variable.
