The error is occurring at the line `response.json["url"]` due to a 'NoneType' object being returned by the `request.url_for("url_for")` function call. This means that the `request.url_for` function is not returning the expected value.

The bug is located in the `url_for` function within the `Request` class. The issue is that the if condition `if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is checking for the presence of '//' in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`, but it should be `self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME")` to retrieve the value of `SERVER_NAME` from the configuration. This is causing the function to take the wrong branch of the if condition and return None.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` function needs to be modified to get the `SERVER_NAME` from the app configuration using `self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME")`. Additionally, the conditional clause for checking the scheme and port can be simplified for better readability.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    server_name = self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME")

    if "//" in server_name:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = f"{host}:{port}"

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```
