The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable" indicates that a NoneType object is being accessed as if it were a subscriptable (like a list or dictionary), leading to the error.

The potential error location is within the `url_for` method provided in the buggy function. It seems that the function is not returning a value, which is causing the TypeError when the test case tries to access the "url" key in the response.json dictionary.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not return any value, and instead, it only contains placeholders (`pass` statements) within the method definitions.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` method should be modified to return the generated URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

With this corrected code, the `url_for` method will now correctly return the absolute URL to the given view, and the test case should be able to access the "url" key in the response.json dictionary without encountering a TypeError.
