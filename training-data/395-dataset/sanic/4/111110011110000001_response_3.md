The error message indicates a `TypeError` when trying to subscript a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the `response.json` is `None`, meaning that the `request.url_for()` method is returning `None` instead of the expected URL.

The potential error location within the `url_for` method is the `return self.app.url_for(...)` line or the subsequent calculations of `netloc`, `_scheme`, and `_server`.

The reason behind this bug might be that the logic for determining `netloc`, `_scheme`, and `_server` is not working as expected, causing the `self.app.url_for()` line to return `None` instead of a valid URL.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining `netloc`, `_scheme`, and `_server` should be reviewed and possibly adjusted. Additionally, the return statement that calls `self.app.url_for()` needs to be checked to ensure that it is returning a valid URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme()
    host = self.host()
    port = self.port()

    if (scheme.lower() in ["http", "ws"] and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ["https", "wss"] and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = f"{host}:{port}"

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, we fixed the issue by properly calling the `self.scheme()`, `self.host()`, and `self.port()` methods and then using the calculated values to determine `netloc`. Additionally, we removed the check for `//` in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` as it does not seem relevant for this method. These changes should ensure that the `url_for` method returns a valid URL as expected.
