The error occurs because the `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is being used in the `url_for` function without being properly initialized. This is causing a `KeyError: 'SERVER_NAME'` when the function is called.

To fix the bug, the `SERVER_NAME` attribute needs to be properly set in the `app` configuration during the application setup. This can be done in the following way:

```python
app = Sanic(__name__)
app.config.SERVER_NAME = "127.0.0.1:8000"  # Replace with the actual server name and port
```

Additionally, the logic in the `url_for` function can be modified to handle the case where `SERVER_NAME` is not set by using the `server_name` and `port` properties of the request object directly.

Here's the corrected `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected version, the function directly uses the `self.server_name` and `self.server_port` attributes to determine the `netloc`. This eliminates the need for the `SERVER_NAME` configuration and should fix the `KeyError` issue.

Moreover, the `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` check and handling has been removed as it is no longer needed.
