Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the problematic function is likely in the calculation of the `netloc` variable. The `host` and `port` variables are used to determine the value of `netloc`, and there might be an issue in this calculation.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `host` and `port` variables are not being obtained or calculated correctly, leading to the misrepresentation of the URL in the `url_for` function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `host` and `port` variables are obtained or calculated correctly.
2. Check if the `scheme` is being determined accurately.
3. Verify that the `_external`, `_scheme`, and `_server` parameters are being passed correctly to the `url_for` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host  # Fixed: using correct attribute for host
    port = self.port  # Fixed: using correct attribute for port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```
