The error occurs in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class. The error is caused by the `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` being used to determine the scheme and netloc in the URL generation process. However, the `SERVER_NAME` attribute is not available in the `config` object, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, the `SERVER_NAME` should be accessed from the `app` object directly, rather than through the `config` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param view_name: name of the view to generate URL for
    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in self.app.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `SERVER_NAME` attribute is accessed directly from the `app` object instead of the `config` object. This should resolve the `KeyError` issue when using the `url_for` method.
