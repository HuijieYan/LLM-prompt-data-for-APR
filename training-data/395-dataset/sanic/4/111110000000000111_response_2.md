The error message indicates a KeyError related to 'SERVER_NAME' when using the `request.url_for` method in Sanic 19.9.0.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `url_for` method, where the code checks for the existence of 'SERVER_NAME' in the application's configuration.

The bug occurs because the `url_for` method is expecting the 'SERVER_NAME' variable to be defined in the application's configuration. However, in the provided bug report, the user is running the server behind a proxy and does not want to hardcode the hostname in the 'SERVER_NAME'. This behavior changed between Sanic version 19.6.3 and 19.9.0, leading to unexpected KeyError in the later version.

To fix the bug, a potential approach is to modify the `url_for` method to handle cases where 'SERVER_NAME' is not defined in the application's configuration. If 'SERVER_NAME' is not available, the method should fall back to other available information to generate the URL, such as 'scheme', 'server_name', and 'server_port'.

Based on the description of the bug, here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` based on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute URL to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if 'SERVER_NAME' in self.app.config:
        if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
            return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, the presence of 'SERVER_NAME' in the application's configuration is checked before attempting to use it. If 'SERVER_NAME' is available, the method behaves as before. If it's not available, the method falls back to using other request information to generate the URL.
