Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is in the logic for determining the `netloc` variable based on the `scheme` and `port`. 

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the logic for determining the `netloc` variable is not taking into account the `scheme` and `port` correctly, which may result in incorrect URLs being generated.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `self.request` object to access the scheme, host, and port instead of accessing them directly from `self`.
2. Check for the presence of the SERVER_NAME in the app.config and handle it accordingly.
3. Ensure that the logic for determining the netloc variable based on the scheme and port is correct.

Corrected Code:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.request.scheme
    host = self.request.host
    port = self.request.port
    
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```
