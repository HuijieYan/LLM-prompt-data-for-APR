The buggy function `url_for` is attempting to generate a correct schema and netloc for the URL based on the request, but it has a conditional statement that checks if `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` contains `//` before calling `self.app.url_for`. This check is unnecessary and leads to the error. 

The bug occurs because the `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is not relevant for determining the scheme and netloc based on the request. Instead, the scheme, server name, and server port attributes of the `Request` object should be used.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement checking for `//` in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` can be removed and the URL can be constructed using the scheme, server name, and server port attributes of the `Request` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```
