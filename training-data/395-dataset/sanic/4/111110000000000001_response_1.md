Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the `url_for` function where the app's configuration `SERVER_NAME` is being checked for the presence of "//". Also, there is a logical error in setting the `netloc` variable.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The conditional check for "//" in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is incorrect and may not accurately determine if the URL is absolute or relative.
2. The logic for determining the `netloc` is also flawed, as it does not handle cases where the port is not the default for the scheme.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use Python's built-in library urllib.parse to properly parse and construct URLs.
2. Use the `self.app.host` property to get the host name and port number, if specified.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlunsplit

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host

    netloc = host
    if "SERVER_PORT" in self.app.config:  # check if server port is configured
        port = self.app.config.SERVER_PORT
        netloc += ':' + str(port)

    return urlunsplit((scheme, netloc, self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs), '', ''))
```
