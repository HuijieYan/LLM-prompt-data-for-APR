Potential error location: The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the `netloc` variable in the `url_for` method. The code is attempting to determine the correct `netloc` based on the `scheme` and `server_port` parameters, but the logic is flawed.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the method is trying to determine the `netloc` using conditional statements based on the `scheme` and `server_port` parameters. However, the conditions used in the code are not correctly identifying the `netloc` for different schemes and port numbers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by directly determining the `netloc` based on the `scheme`, `server_name`, and `server_port` parameters. Additionally, the conditions to check for port numbers associated with `http`, `https`, `ws`, and `wss` schemes need to be updated for accuracy.

Corrected code:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws"):
        netloc = host
        if port != 80:
            netloc += ":" + str(port)
    elif scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss"):
        netloc = host
        if port != 443:
            netloc += ":" + str(port)
    else:
        netloc = host + ":" + str(port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```
