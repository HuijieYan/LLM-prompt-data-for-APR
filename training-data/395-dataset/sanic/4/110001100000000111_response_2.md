The bug occurs in the `url_for` function within the provided function/method. The error occurs because the function is trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` variable from the configuration, but the `SERVER_NAME` variable is not defined in the configuration.

The bug occurs because `SERVER_NAME` is not a default configuration variable in Sanic. The function is assuming that `SERVER_NAME` is present in the configuration, but it's not. 

To fix the bug, the function should use the `host` and `port` variables directly from the request object rather than trying to access `SERVER_NAME` from the configuration. 

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host
    port = self.port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `host` and `port` are accessed directly from the request object, and the `SERVER_NAME` variable from the configuration is no longer used. This should resolve the KeyError issue.
