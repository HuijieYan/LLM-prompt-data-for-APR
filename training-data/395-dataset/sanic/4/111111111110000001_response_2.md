The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object is being accessed as if it were subscriptable, which means that the response.json["url"] is trying to access a key in a dictionary but the response.json is None.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'url_for' method in the 'Request' class. It seems that the 'url_for' method is not returning a valid URL, thus causing the response.json["url"] to be None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the 'url_for' method is not properly constructing the URL based on the request.

To fix the bug, the 'url_for' method needs to properly handle the construction of the URL based on the request, including determining the scheme, netloc, and port. Additionally, it needs to ensure that it returns a valid URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic 'url_for' method:

```python
# corrected url_for method in the Request class
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

By handling the construction of the URL based on the request and ensuring that a valid URL is returned, the bug should be fixed.
