The error message indicates a KeyError is being raised when trying to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` in the `url_for` method of the `request` object. This suggests that the `SERVER_NAME` attribute is not present in the `config` attribute of the `app`. This leads to a `None` value being returned and causing the subsequent TypeError when trying to access `response.json["url"]`.

The potential error location within the `url_for` method is the following line:
```python
if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
```
This is where the KeyError is likely occurring.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that in the newer version of Sanic (19.9.0), the `SERVER_NAME` attribute is no longer automatically present in the `config` attribute of the `app`. This change in behavior is causing the `SERVER_NAME` to be missing from the config, resulting in the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to identify an alternative way to determine the `scheme` and `netloc` based on the request without relying on the `SERVER_NAME` attribute. This could involve using the `request` object itself or other attributes from the `app`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the corrected function returns a valid absolute URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, we've removed the check for `SERVER_NAME` from the `config` attribute and directly used the attributes available in the `self` and `app` objects to determine the `scheme`, `host`, and `port` for generating the absolute URL. This should fix the KeyError and ensure that a valid absolute URL is returned.
