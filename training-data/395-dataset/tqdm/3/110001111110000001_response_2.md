The error occurs in the `__len__` function of the `tqdm` class. The error message indicates that a 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer, suggesting that the `t` object is of type 'None'.

Upon review, it is clear that the `self.iterable` attribute is not being properly handled, potentially leading to it representing a 'None' value. This might be the cause of the error in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.iterable` is None and handle that case separately. If it is not None, we need to proceed with the other checks i.e., check for the existence of the `shape` attribute and the `__len__` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

By implementing these changes, the `__len__` function will properly handle the `self.iterable` attribute and return the correct length.
