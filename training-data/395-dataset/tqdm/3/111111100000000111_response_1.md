The error is occurring in the __len__ method of the tqdm class. The error message indicates that the _io.BufferedReader object doesn't have a len(), and this is causing the TypeError when the requests library tries to treat tqdm as a boolean.

The bug is occurring because the __len__ method does not check whether the iterable supports the __len__ method before trying to calculate the length.

To fix the bug, we can modify the __len__ method to first check if the iterable supports the __len__ method. If it does, then we can return the length of the iterable. Otherwise, we can return the total length if it was passed explicitly.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape") and hasattr(self.iterable.shape, "__len__"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    else:
        return 0  # Return a default value if no length information is available
```

With this corrected code, the __len__ method first checks if the total length is explicitly provided, then checks if the iterable supports the __len__ method, and lastly checks for an alternative method to determine the length of the iterable. If none of these conditions are met, a default value of 0 is returned.
