The error occurs when the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function is called with a generator as an argument. The issue appears to be related to the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class not handling cases where the iterable does not support `len()`. 

The reason behind the bug is that when `get_bool_for_tqdm` is called with a generator, the `__len__` method of `tqdm` class tries to retrieve the length of the iterable with `len(self.iterable)`. However, generators do not support `len()`, which causes the error.

To fix this bug, the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class should be modified to handle cases where the iterable does not support `len()`. Additionally, implementing a separate `__bool__` method that returns `True` if `__len__` returns `None` or if `total` was passed for a non-measurable iterable will help prevent the error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # Corrected __len__ method
    def __len__(self):
        if self.total is not None:
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None:
            if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
                return len(self.iterable)
        
        return None
    
    # Implementing separate __bool__ method
    def __bool__(self):
        return self.total is not None or bool(self.iterable)
```

With these changes, the `__len__` method will check if `total` is not `None` and return it. If `total` is not provided and the iterable supports `len()`, it will return the length of the iterable. Otherwise, it will return `None`. The `__bool__` method will return `True` if `total` is not `None` or if the iterable is not empty.
