The error is occurring in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function in the `test_bool` test case. This function is returning a TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement in the `__len__` method. It is trying to return the length of the iterable, but it is not handling the case where `self.iterable` is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` method is not properly handling the case where `self.iterable` is None. It assumes that `self.iterable` will always have a valid value.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where `self.iterable` is None in the `__len__` method. We can use an if-else statement to first check if `self.iterable` is None, and if it is, we can return the value of `self.total`. If `self.iterable` is not None, we can proceed with the original logic.

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
