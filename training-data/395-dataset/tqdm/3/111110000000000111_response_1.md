The error occurs when the `tqdm` object is being used with the `requests.post` function. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class, which is used to determine the length of the iterable. The error occurs because `__len__` function tries to get the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports the `__len__` method.

To fix this bug, the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class needs to be modified to handle cases where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method.

Here's the corrected `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape") and hasattr(self.iterable.shape, "__getitem__"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
    else:
        return self.total
```

In the corrected code:
- It first checks if the `total` attribute is None. If so, it then checks if the iterable supports the `__len__` method. If it does, it returns the length of the iterable. If not, it checks if the iterable has a `shape` attribute and if the `shape` attribute is subscriptable. If both conditions are met, it returns the length of the `shape` attribute.
- If the `total` attribute is not None, it simply returns the value of the `total` attribute.

This should resolve the issue where the `__len__` method tries to get the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports the `__len__` method.
