The error occurs in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The error message indicates that a TypeError occurs on `return bool(t)`. This means that the `bool` conversion is failing because `t` is `None`, which suggests that the `__len__` method is not returning a valid length.

The error arises because when `tqdm` is called with an iterable that does not support `__len__`, the `__len__` method does not account for this and tries to retrieve the length of the iterable. This causes the `NoneType` error when the length cannot be obtained.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` method should be modified to account for cases where the length of the iterable is not obtainable. Additionally, implementing a separate `__bool__` method that returns `True` when `__len__` returns `None` would also be beneficial.

Here's the corrected `__len__` method based on the suggested approaches:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0
```

Additionally, a separate `__bool__` method can be added to the `tqdm` class to improve its behavior when treated as a boolean:

```python
def __bool__(self):
    if self.total is None:
        return True
    return self.total > 0
```
