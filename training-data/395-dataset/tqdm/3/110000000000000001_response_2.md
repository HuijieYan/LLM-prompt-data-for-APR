Potential Error Location: The error may be occurring in the function due to the incorrect conditional statements that check the type of the iterable.

Reason for the Bug: The conditional statements used to check the type of the iterable and retrieve its length are not correctly structured. The use of a single line for multiple conditional checks is also confusing and error-prone.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use separate if-else statements to handle different cases based on the type of the iterable.
2. Check for the validity of the iterable before attempting to retrieve its length.
3. Provide a default behavior when the iterable is not valid or does not have a length property.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
