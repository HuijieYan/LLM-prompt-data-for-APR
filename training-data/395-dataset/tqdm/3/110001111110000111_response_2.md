The error message is pointing to the line `return bool(t)` in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function within the `internal` function. The error message states that a `TypeError` occurred because a 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.

The issue is occurring because the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class is not returning the correct length. The function is attempting to get the length of `self.iterable` without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`. This causes the function to return `None`, leading to the `TypeError` when `bool(t)` is called.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `__len__` method to explicitly check if the iterable supports `__len__` before attempting to get its length. If it does, then return the length using `len(self.iterable)`. If it doesn't, then return the total if it was passed or `None` otherwise.

Here's the corrected `__len__` function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

This corrected function now explicitly checks whether the iterable supports `__len__` and returns the appropriate length or the total if it was passed.
