The issue arises from the fact that the `__len__` function doesn't properly handle cases where the iterable object doesn't have a length. This causes the TypeError when certain iterable types are passed to `tqdm`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__len__` function to properly handle cases where the iterable object doesn't have a length. If the iterable has a `shape` attribute (e.g., a NumPy array), we can return the length specified in the `shape` attribute. If the iterable has a `__len__` attribute, we can return the value of `len(self.iterable)`. Otherwise, we can return the value of `self.total` if it's available, or `None` if none of the above options apply.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
With this fix, the `__len__` function will handle cases where the iterable object doesn't have a length, preventing the TypeError from occurring.
