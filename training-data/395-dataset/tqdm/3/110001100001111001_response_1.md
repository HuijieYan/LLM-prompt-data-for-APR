Potential error location: The return statement in the function is overly complex and does not cover all possible cases for the iterable and total attributes.

Reason behind the bug: The function does not account for all possible types of iterables, such as lists, generators, or objects without a shape attribute.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the return statement to explicitly check for different iterable types and return the appropriate length.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif isinstance(self.iterable, range):
        return len(self.iterable)
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
