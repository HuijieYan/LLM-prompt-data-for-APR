The error message indicates a TypeError on the line `return bool(t)`, specifically stating that a 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement `return self.total if self.iterable is None else ...`, which seems to be returning None when `self.iterable` is not None.

The issue is occurring because the code is using a conditional expression to return the length of the iterable if it exists, but if it doesn't exist, it's trying to return `self.total`, which is not capturing the length of the iterable when it's not None.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the iterable is not None. If the iterable is None, it should return `self.total` as a fallback, but if the iterable is not None, it should return the length of the iterable. This can be achieved by first checking if the iterable exists, and if it does, returning its length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function

def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is not None:
        return self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape") else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__") else 0
    else:
        return self.total if hasattr(self, "total") else 0
```

This corrected function checks if the iterable exists and returns its length if it does. If it doesn't, it falls back to returning `self.total` if it exists. Additionally, if neither the iterable nor `self.total` exists, it will return 0.
