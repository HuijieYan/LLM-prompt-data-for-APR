Potential error location:
The potential error is in the __len__ method, where the condition to check for the length of the iterable is incorrect. The code is not handling the case where self.iterable is None.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where self.iterable is None. It only checks for the length of the iterable if it is not None, leading to unexpected behavior and errors when self.iterable is None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition to check if self.iterable is None before checking its length.
2. Provide a default length value if self.iterable is None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
    else:
        return (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
                else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
                else getattr(self, "total", None))
```
