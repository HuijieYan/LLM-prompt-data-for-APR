Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the __len__ method of the tqdm class. The error message indicates that the __len__ method tries to get the length of self.iterable without checking if the iterable supports __len__, which leads to a TypeError.

Reasons behind the bug: The __len__ method does not have proper checks to determine if the iterable supports __len__, leading to the TypeError when trying to get the length of an iterable that does not support it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement checks to see if the iterable supports __len__ before attempting to get the length.
2. Return the correct length if total was passed for a non-measurable iterable.
3. Implement a separate __bool__ method that returns True if __len__ returned None, or just return True always.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    def __len__(self):
        if self.total is not None:
            return self.total
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return None
```

In the corrected code, the __len__ method first checks if the total is not None and returns it. If total is not provided, it then checks if the iterable has a length using hasattr and returns the length if available. If it doesn't have a length, it returns None. This approach ensures that the __len__ method does not throw a TypeError when trying to get the length of an iterable that does not support it.
