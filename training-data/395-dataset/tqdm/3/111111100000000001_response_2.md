Potential Error:
The problematic part of the function is the handling of the `self.iterable` attribute. In the return statement, there is a lack of clarity and consistency in how `self.iterable` is being used to determine the length of the iterable.

Reason for Bug:
The buggy function doesn't handle the case where the `self.iterable` is not a NumPy array or a standard Python iterable. It doesn't have a mechanism to determine the length of `self.iterable` in more general cases.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can use a more comprehensive approach to determine the length of `self.iterable`. This can be done by using the `len()` function directly on `self.iterable` without the need for conditional checks.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    return getattr(self, "total", None) if self.iterable is None else len(self.iterable)
```
In the corrected code, we use `getattr(self, "total", None)` to return the `total` attribute if it exists, and if it doesn't, we simply return the length of `self.iterable` using the `len()` function. This approach provides a more generalized and robust solution for determining the length of the iterable.
