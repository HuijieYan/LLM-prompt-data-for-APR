The error message indicates that there is a `NoneType` object that cannot be interpreted as an integer in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function. This suggests that the issue may be related to the return value of the function when `tqdm` is called with certain arguments.

Looking at the buggy function, the line where the return value is calculated is a nested conditional statement. The issue may be related to the structure of the conditional chain and the handling of the return values.

The buggy function has issues with handling different types of iterable objects and determining their lengths. The nested conditional statement does not cover all possible cases and may return incorrect values, especially when dealing with iterable objects such as generators or empty lists.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle different types of iterable objects and determine their lengths accurately. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total")
```

This revised code uses a series of `if-elif` statements to check for different types of iterable objects and retrieve their lengths accordingly. It covers a wider range of possible cases and provides accurate length calculations for the given iterable inputs.
