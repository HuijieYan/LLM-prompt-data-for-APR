The error occurs in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The error message indicates that the `__len__` method is returning a `NoneType`, which cannot be interpreted as an integer.

This bug occurs because the `__len__` method assumes that the `iterable` attribute always has a `__len__` method, which is not necessarily true. The method should check if the `iterable` attribute has a `__len__` method before attempting to call it.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if the `iterable` attribute is `None` or if it has an attribute `shape`. If both conditions are false, check if the `iterable` has a `__len__` method. If it does, return the length of the `iterable`. If none of these conditions are met, return the value of `self.total`.
2. Implement a separate `__bool__` method that returns `True` if the `__len__` method returns `None`. This would ensure that the `tqdm` object can be treated as a boolean and prevent the TypeError.

The corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

Additionally, the separate `__bool__` method:

```python
def __bool__(self):
    return self.__len__() is not None
```
With these changes, the `__len__` method will return the correct length and the `__bool__` method will ensure that the `tqdm` object can be treated as a boolean.
