The error is occurring because the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object is trying to get the length of an iterable without checking if the iterable supports the `__len__` method. This causes an error when the iterable does not have a length, such as the case with a file opened using `_io.BufferedReader`.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` method should first check if the iterable has the `__len__` method, and if not, then it should return the `total` attribute if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```

With this correction, the `__len__` method first checks if `self.total` is not None and returns it if it exists. If not, it checks if the iterable has the `__len__` method, and if it does, it returns the length of the iterable. Otherwise, it returns 0.

This should handle the cases where the iterable does not have a length, and also account for the `total` attribute if it is provided.
