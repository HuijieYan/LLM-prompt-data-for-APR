The error occurs in the `__len__` method of the provided `tqdm` class. The error message indicates that the `TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer` is raised when trying to interpret `bool(None)` in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function.

The issue stems from how the `__len__` method is implemented in the `tqdm` class. When the `iterable` is a generator, it does not have a length, and the `__len__` method should return `None`, so that Python falls back to `__bool__`. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario properly.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `__len__` method. It should return `self.total` if it exists and the `iterable` is `None`. If the `iterable` is not `None`, it should check if it has a `len` attribute. If it does, it should return the length, otherwise, it should return `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    if self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return None
```

With this modification, the `tqdm` class should handle the case of generators and other non-measurable iterables correctly.
