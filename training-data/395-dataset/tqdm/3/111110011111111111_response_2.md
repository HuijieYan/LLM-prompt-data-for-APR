The error message indicates that the issue occurs when the `tqdm` object is treated as a bool. This error happens when the `__len__` method is called on the `tqdm` object, and it tries to get the length of `self.iterable` without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`.

The potential error location is in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The bug occurs because the `__len__` method tries to get the length of `self.iterable` without checking if it supports `__len__`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__len__` method to handle cases where `self.iterable` does not support `__len__`. We can use `hasattr` to check if the iterable supports `__len__`. If it does, we can return the length of the iterable. Otherwise, we should return the value of `self.total` if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):  # check if the iterable supports __len__
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

With this correction, the `__len__` method will first check if the iterable supports `__len__`. If it does, it will return the length of the iterable. If not, it will return the value of `self.total` if it exists.

This corrected code should resolve the issue where the `tqdm` object cannot be treated as a bool when used with an opened file.
