Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `__len__` method of the tqdm object. The error occurs when Python tries to treat tqdm as a boolean to determine if something is passed or not, and falls back to `__len__` which is buggy.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `__len__` method of the tqdm object does not handle cases where the iterable does not support `__len__` properly. Additionally, there is no `__bool__` method to handle boolean evaluation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the iterable supports `__len__` before attempting to get the length of the iterable.
2. Implement a separate `__bool__` method which returns True if `__len__` returned None, or just return True always.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    if self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return None

def __bool__(self):
    return True
```
