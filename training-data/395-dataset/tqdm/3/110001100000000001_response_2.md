Potential error location: The problematic part of the code is the return statement where it tries to determine the length of the iterable. The logic in the return statement is convoluted and may cause issues.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to determine the length of the iterable in a complicated way, using multiple conditions and the hasattr function. This makes the code hard to read and understand, and it may not cover all possible cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a simple if-else statement to check if the iterable has a shape attribute, and if not, check for the length using the __len__ method.
2. Remove unnecessary checks and use a more straightforward approach to determine the length of the iterable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
