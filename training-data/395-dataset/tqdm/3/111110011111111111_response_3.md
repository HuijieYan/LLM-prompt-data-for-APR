The error occurs when the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function is called with a generator as an argument. This triggers a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer` due to a faulty implementation of the `__len__` method.

The issue is with the current implementation of the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class. The method assumes that the iterable has a `len` attribute, but it does not check for this before trying to access the length.

To fix this issue, the `__len__` method should first check if the iterable has a `len` attribute and then return the length if available. If the iterable does not have a `len` attribute, it should return `self.total` if available, or `None` if not. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when the function is called with a generator.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

This implementation first checks if the iterable has a `__len__` attribute and returns the length if available. Otherwise, it returns `self.total` if available, or `None` if not. This will prevent the `TypeError` from occurring with generators and other non-measurable iterables.
