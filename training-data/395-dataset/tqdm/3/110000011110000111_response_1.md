The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to interpret a 'NoneType' object as an integer. This is happening when the `tqdm` object is being treated as a boolean in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function.

The potential error location is the `__len__` method within the `tqdm` object, as this is where the TypeError is being raised.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` method is attempting to get the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`. This results in a TypeError when the length of the iterable cannot be determined.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__len__` method to first check if the iterable supports `__len__`. If it does, then we can safely return the length of the iterable. Otherwise, we need to return the `total` attribute if it exists, or just return None.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total if hasattr(self, "total") else 0
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total if hasattr(self, "total") else None
```
