The error stems from the __len__ method of the tqdm object. The use-case provided involves wrapping an opened file with tqdm and then using it to display the upload progress when sending the file with the requests library. The error occurs when requests tries to treat tqdm as a boolean to determine if there is something passed or not. Tqdm has no __bool__, so Python falls back to __len__. And __len__ is buggy in that it tries to get len(self.iterable) without checking if the iterable supports __len__.

The potential error location is in the __len__ method:
```python
def __len__(self):
    return self.total if self.iterable is None else \
        (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
         else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
         else getattr(self, "total", None))
```

To fix the bug, we can modify the __len__ method to first check if the iterable supports __len__ before trying to get the length of the iterable. This will prevent the TypeError when requests library tries to treat tqdm as a boolean.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ method:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
