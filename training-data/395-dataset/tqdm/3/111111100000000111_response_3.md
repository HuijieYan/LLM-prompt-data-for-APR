1. The error occurs when trying to use the tqdm object with the `requests.post()` method. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `__len__` method of the tqdm object.

2. The potential error location is within the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class.

3. The bug occurs because the `__len__` method does not handle the case where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method, causing an error when trying to get the length of the iterable.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `__len__` method to handle cases where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method. This can be done by using a try-except block to catch the AttributeError and handle it appropriately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
In this corrected code, we handle the case where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method by using a try-except block. If the iterable does not support `__len__`, we return the value of `self.total` or None.
