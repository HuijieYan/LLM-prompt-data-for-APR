Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the return statement of the __len__ method.

Reason behind the bug: The return statement contains multiple conditions, but it does not handle the case where none of the conditions are met. This will lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use if-else statements to handle each condition separately, and make sure to check for the case where none of the conditions are met.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
