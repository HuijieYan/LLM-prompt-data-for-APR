The error occurred when the `tqdm` object was treated as a boolean to determine if there was something passed or not. Since `tqdm` has no `__bool__` method, Python falls back to `__len__`, which is buggy in that it tries to get the length of `self.iterable` without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` occurred at the line `return bool(t)` in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class to properly handle cases where the length cannot be determined. Additionally, we can implement a `__bool__` method that returns `True` if `__len__` returns `None`. This would address the issue of treating `tqdm` as a boolean when no explicit total is given.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` and `__bool__` methods in the `tqdm` class:

```python
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __len__(self):
        if self.total:
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None and hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return None

    def __bool__(self):
        return self.__len__() is not None
```

By implementing the above changes, the error should be resolved, and the `tqdm` object should behave as expected when treated as a boolean.
