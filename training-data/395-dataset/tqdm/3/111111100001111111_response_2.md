The error occurs due to the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. This method is checking if the `iterable` attribute supports `__len__` and only then calling `len(self.iterable)`. This causes an issue when the `iterable` does not support `__len__`, as in the case of a file.

To fix this issue, the `__len__` method needs to be updated to handle cases where the `iterable` does not support `__len__`.

Here's the corrected `__len__` method with the suggested fixes:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return 0  # You may choose to return a different value based on your requirements
    else:
        return 0  # You may choose to return a different value based on your requirements
```

With these adjustments, the `__len__` method checks if `total` is specified and returns it. If not, it checks if the `iterable` supports `__len__` and returns the length if it does. If the `iterable` does not support `__len__`, it returns 0, but you can choose to return a different value based on your requirements.

This should address the issue where the Python interpreter is falling back to the `__len__` method when treating `tqdm` as a boolean.
