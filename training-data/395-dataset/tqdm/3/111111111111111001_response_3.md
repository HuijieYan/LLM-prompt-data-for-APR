The __len__ function is returning the value of self.total when self.iterable has a length of 0, which results in a NoneType error when an attempt is made to interpret it as an integer. The function does not handle the case when the iterable has a length of 0.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic inside the __len__ function to properly handle the cases when self.iterable is None or when its length is 0. We can use an if-else statement to check the length of self.iterable and return the appropriate value.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

With this correction, the function will return the length of the iterable if it exists, or the value of self.total if the iterable is None. This addresses the issue of the function returning a NoneType when an attempt is made to interpret it as an integer, fixing the bug.
