The error occurs because the `__len__` method is returning `None` when it should be returning an integer value. This error is triggered in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function on line 1742 when `return bool(t)` is called, and `t` is None.

The bug occurs because the `__len__` method is not properly implemented. It is trying to determine the length of the `iterable`, but it handles different cases incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__len__` method to correctly handle the different cases for determining the length of the `iterable`. We will use a series of conditional statements to check for the presence of attributes like "shape" and "__len__" to determine the size of the `iterable`. If none of these attributes are found, we will default to returning the value of `total`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total
```
