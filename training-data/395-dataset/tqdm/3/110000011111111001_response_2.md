The error message is indicating that a TypeError occurred because a 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer. The relevant part of the code is the function get_bool_for_tqdm, particularly the line return bool(t). This suggests the bug is likely within the function provided at the beginning.

The reason for the bug is that the initial function __len__ is not correctly implemented. It attempts to handle different cases with conditionals for None, whether the iterable has a shape attribute, and whether it has a __len__ attribute. However, the syntax of the conditional statements may be causing unexpected behavior, leading to the TypeError observed in the error message.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the __len__ method to use nested if-else statements instead of the conditional expression for improved readability and reliability. Additionally, each if-else block should return the actual length of the iterable if applicable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

This refactored implementation uses nested if-else statements to handle the different cases more explicitly and returns the actual length of the iterable when applicable. This should address the potential bug and resolve the TypeError reported in the error message.
