The bug in the __len__ method is that it returns different types of values based on different conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

The buggy code tries to return self.total if it exists, but it can return None if self.total does not exist. Additionally, it doesn't correctly handle cases where self.iterable is empty or does not have a defined length.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to explicitly check for each condition and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0  # default to 0 if total and iterable are both None
```

This fixed code explicitly checks for the existence of self.total and self.iterable, and handles each condition appropriately. If self.total exists, it returns that value. If self.iterable has a defined length (using either shape attribute or len function), it returns that length. If none of these conditions are met, it defaults to returning 0.
