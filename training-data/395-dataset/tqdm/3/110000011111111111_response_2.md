The error is occurring in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised because a `NoneType` object cannot be interpreted as an integer. This suggests that the `tqdm` object is not being handled correctly as a boolean or is lacking a valid length attribute.

The `__len__` method is attempting to return the length of the `self.iterable` object, but it does not handle cases where the `iterable` does not have a valid length or is `None`. This leads to the `TypeError` when the `tqdm` object is interpreted as a boolean.

To fix this, the `__len__` method should be modified to handle cases where `iterable` is `None` or does not have a valid length. Additionally, a separate `__bool__` method can be implemented to return True if `__len__` returns None, ensuring that the `tqdm` object can be interpreted as a boolean.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` and `__bool__` methods:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return getattr(self, "total", 0) if self.total is not None else None
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", 0)

def __bool__(self):
    return True
```

This modified `__len__` method first checks if `self.iterable` is not `None` and then tries to obtain its length using different methods. If `self.iterable` is `None`, it returns the value of `self.total`. The `__bool__` method is implemented to always return `True`, ensuring that the `tqdm` object can be interpreted as a boolean.

With these modifications, the `tqdm` object should be properly handled when used in the given test cases.
