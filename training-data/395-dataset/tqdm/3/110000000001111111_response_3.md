The potential error in the given code is the incorrect implementation of the `__len__` method. This method is supposed to return the length of the object, but the current implementation is checking for specific attributes and not returning the actual length.

The bug occurs because the `__len__` method is trying to get the length of the iterable without properly checking if the iterable supports `__len__`. This causes issues when the iterable is not measurable, such as in the case of a file being read.

To fix the bug, we need to implement the `__len__` method in a way that properly handles different types of iterables and returns the correct length. Additionally, we should also implement a `__bool__` method as suggested in the GitHub issue description to handle cases where the length is not available.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
    
def __bool__(self):
    return True
```

With this corrected implementation, the `__len__` method properly handles different types of iterables and returns the correct length when available. Additionally, the `__bool__` method always returns `True` as suggested in the GitHub issue description.
