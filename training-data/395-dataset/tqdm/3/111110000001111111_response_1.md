The bug occurs because the __len__ function in the tqdm class does not handle the case where the iterable does not support the len() function, such as in the case of a file object. The function also does not have a separate __bool__ implementation, which causes it to fallback to __len__ when Python tries to treat tqdm as a boolean.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the __len__ function to handle cases where the iterable does not support len(). We also need to implement a separate __bool__ function to determine the boolean value of tqdm.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ function and the addition of a separate __bool__ function:

```python
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # Corrected __len__ function
    def __len__(self):
        if self.iterable is not None:
            if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
                return self.iterable.shape[0]
            elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
                return len(self.iterable)
        return getattr(self, "total", None)

    # Separate __bool__ implementation
    def __bool__(self):
        return True
```

With these changes, the __len__ function will handle cases where the iterable does not support len(), and the __bool__ function will provide the boolean value for tqdm. This should resolve the issue where tqdm cannot be treated as a bool when used with an opened file.
