The error occurs in the __len__ function of the tqdm class. The issue arises when the Python interpreter tries to treat tqdm as a boolean to determine if something has been passed or not. Since tqdm does not have a __bool__ method, Python falls back to __len__, which is implemented with a buggy logic causing the TypeError.

The potential error location is in the if-else logic of the __len__ function, specifically in the portion where it tries to obtain the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports __len__.

To fix the bug, we can modify the __len__ function to handle the cases where the iterable doesn't support __len__. Instead of trying to get the length directly, we can first check if the iterable has a shape or a __len__ attribute, and then return the appropriate length. If none of these are present, we can return the value of self.total if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
