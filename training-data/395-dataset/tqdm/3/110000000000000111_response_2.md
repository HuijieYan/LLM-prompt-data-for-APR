Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the __len__ method of the tqdm class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the __len__ method does not handle the case where the iterable does not support the __len__ method. Additionally, there is no separate __bool__ method implemented to return True if __len__ returns None.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the iterable supports the __len__ method before trying to get its length.
2. Implement a separate __bool__ method that returns True if __len__ returns None, or just return True always.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected __len__ method
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```
In the corrected code, we handle the case where self.iterable does not support the __len__ method by checking for its shape and returning its length. We also return 0 if no length can be determined.
