Potential error location:

The potential error lies in the return statement of the __len__ method. The current implementation tries to handle the length of the iterable in a non-standard way by using attributes like "shape" and "__len__" which may not be available for all types of iterables.

Reason behind the bug:

The current implementation does not handle the length of the iterable properly. It tries to access "shape" attribute (typically available for numpy arrays) and "__len__" attribute, which may not be available for all iterables.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the iterable is a numpy array and use the "shape" attribute to get its length
2. Otherwise, use the standard len() function to get the length of the iterable

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
