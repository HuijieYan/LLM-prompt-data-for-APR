The error occurs when the `bool` function is called on a `tqdm` object that was created with `disable=True`. The error message indicates that the `tqdm` object has no attribute 'total' when the `bool` function is called.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely when the `__len__` function is called on the `tqdm` object.

The bug occurs because when `disable` is set to `True`, the initialization code for `tqdm` does not set the `total` attribute, and the `__len__` function tries to access this attribute. Since `total` is not set when `disable` is `True`, it causes the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the initialization code for `tqdm` should set the `total` attribute even when `disable` is `True`. This will ensure that the `__len__` function can access the `total` attribute when the `bool` function is called on the `tqdm` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (other parameters)
    """
    self.total = total  # Set the total attribute
    if file is None:
        file = sys.stderr
    if disable is None and hasattr(file, "isatty") and not file.isatty():
        disable = True
    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        return
    # ... (other initialization code)
```

By adding `self.total = total` in the `__init__` function, the bug can be fixed. Now when the `bool` function is called on a `tqdm` object with `disable=True`, it will evaluate to `False` as expected.
