The test case aims to verify the boolean casting behavior of the `tqdm` object. It creates `tqdm` objects with different settings and asserts their boolean value.

The error message indicates an AttributeError: 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'. This suggests that the `tqdm` object lacks the `total` attribute, which is used in the `__len__` function. However, the `total` attribute is expected based on the test case, as it is used during the creation of `tqdm` objects.

The error is likely located within the constructor (`__init__`) of the `tqdm` class. It seems that the constructor is not correctly setting the `total` attribute, leading to the AttributeError in the test case.

The bug is occurring because the `total` attribute is not being set by the constructor of the `tqdm` class. This attribute is essential for the proper functioning of the `tqdm` objects, as demonstrated by the test case.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function of the `tqdm` class should be updated to correctly set the `total` attribute based on the input parameters. This can be done by ensuring that the provided `total` parameter is assigned to `self.total` within the constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `tqdm` class:

```python
# ... (previous code)

def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable  : iterable, optional
        Iterable to decorate with a progressbar.
        Leave blank to manually manage the updates.
    desc  : str, optional
        Prefix for the progressbar.
    total  : int, optional
        The number of expected iterations. If unspecified,
        len(iterable) is used if possible. As a last resort, only basic
        progress statistics are displayed (no ETA, no progressbar).
        If `gui` is True and this parameter needs subsequent updating,
        specify an initial arbitrary large positive integer,
        e.g. int(9e9).
    # ... (other parameters)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : decorated iterator.
    """

    # Set the total attribute
    self.total = total

    # ... (other parameter assignments)

# ... (remaining code)
```

By adding `self.total = total` within the `__init__` function, the bug related to the missing `total` attribute should be fixed.
