The error message indicates an AttributeError with the message "'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'". This error occurs when the `total` attribute is being accessed from the `tqdm` object, but the object does not have this attribute.

It seems that the problem lies in the initialization of the `tqdm` object. Looking at the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class, it seems that the `total` attribute is not being set correctly, which leads to the AttributeError during the test case.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the `total` attribute is set correctly during the initialization of the `tqdm` object. This may involve checking the iterable and setting the total based on the length of the iterable if it is not provided explicitly.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    if file is None:
        file = sys.stderr

    if disable is None and hasattr(file, "isatty") and not file.isatty():
        disable = True

    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        return

    if kwargs:
        self.disable = True
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        raise (TqdmDeprecationWarning("""\
`nested` is deprecated and automated. Use position instead for manual control.
""", fp_write=getattr(file, 'write', sys.stderr.write)) if "nested" in kwargs
            else TqdmKeyError("Unknown argument(s): " + str(kwargs)))

    if total is None and iterable is not None:
        try:
            total = len(iterable)
        except (TypeError, AttributeError):
            total = None

    # ... (other parameter preprocessing)

    # Store the arguments
    self.iterable = iterable
    self.desc = desc or ''
    self.total = total  # Set the 'total' attribute
    # ... (other attribute assignments)
```

By explicitly setting the `total` attribute based on the length of the `iterable`, if it is not provided, the `total` attribute will exist and prevent the AttributeError from occurring in the test case.
