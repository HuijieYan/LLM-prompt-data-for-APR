The test case tries to create a tqdm object with the `total` parameter and then checks whether the object evaluates to `True` or `False` when used as a boolean. The error occurs when the test case tries to create a tqdm object with the `total` parameter set to 0 and then evaluates it as a boolean.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `__init__` method. It seems that the `total` parameter is not being properly processed or stored as an attribute of the tqdm object, which is leading to the AttributeError when the object is evaluated.

The reason behind the bug is that the `total` parameter is not being properly handled when initializing the tqdm object. It might not be getting stored as an attribute of the object, leading to the AttributeError when the object is evaluated.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly store the `total` parameter as an attribute of the tqdm object during initialization. This would ensure that the object has the `total` attribute available when it is evaluated as a boolean.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
class Tqdm:
    def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
                 file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
                 miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
                 unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
                 bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
                 unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
        # Rest of the code remains the same after modifying the __init__ method accordingly
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.desc = desc or ''
        self.total = total
        # rest of the attributes...
```

In the corrected code, the `total` parameter is properly stored as an attribute of the tqdm object during initialization. This should fix the AttributeError when the object is evaluated as a boolean.
