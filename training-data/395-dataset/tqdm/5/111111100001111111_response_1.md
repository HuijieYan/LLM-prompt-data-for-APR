The bug occurs when a `tqdm` object is created with `disable=True` and then evaluated using `bool()`. This results in an AttributeError because the `tqdm` object does not have a `total` attribute when `disable` is set to True.

The bug is located within the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class. When `disable` is True, the method fails to handle the `tqdm` object properly and results in the AttributeError when the object is evaluated as a boolean.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to properly handle the case when `disable` is True and return the correct boolean value when the `tqdm` object is evaluated using `bool()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class:
```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as the original method but include the following changes to handle the disable case:
    """
    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        return False
```
By adding the `return False` statement within the if `disable` block, we ensure that when the `tqdm` object is created with `disable=True`, it returns `False` when evaluated using `bool()`.
