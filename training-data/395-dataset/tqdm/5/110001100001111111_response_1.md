The error occurs when trying to convert a tqdm object to boolean if it was created with disable=True. The error message indicates that the 'total' attribute is missing when disable is set to True.

The potential error location is in the __init__ method of the tqdm class. When disable is True, the code returns early without initializing the 'total' attribute, causing the AttributeError when trying to evaluate the object as a boolean.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If disable is True, initialize the 'total' attribute to None to prevent the AttributeError when checking for existence of the tqdm object.
2. Ensure that all attributes required for normal operation are initialized regardless of the value of disable.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method of the tqdm class:

```python
# corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    if file is None:
        file = sys.stderr

    if disable is None and hasattr(file, "isatty") and not file.isatty():
        disable = True

    self.iterable = iterable
    self.disable = disable
    self.pos = 0  # indicate that the progressbar is disabled
    self._instances.remove(self)
    self.n = initial
    self.total = total  # initialize total attribute to None regardless of disable
```
With this correction, the code initializes the 'total' attribute to None when disable is True, preventing the AttributeError when evaluating the tqdm object as a boolean.
