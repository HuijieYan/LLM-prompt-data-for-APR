The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object does not have an attribute 'total', which is accessed within the `__len__` method. This points to the method `__len__` in the tqdm class as the potential location for the bug.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` method is trying to access the 'total' attribute from the 'tqdm' object, but it seems that the 'tqdm' object does not have this attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'tqdm' object has a 'total' attribute by initializing it in the constructor. We can also modify the logic within the `__len__` method to handle the case where 'total' may not be present.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class tqdm(Comparable):
    # ... (other methods)

    def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
                 file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
                 # ... (other parameters)
                 gui=False, **kwargs):
        """
        Parameters
        ----------
        iterable  : iterable, optional
            Iterable to decorate with a progressbar.
            Leave blank to manually manage the updates.
        desc  : str, optional
            Prefix for the progressbar.
        total  : int, optional
            The number of expected iterations.
        # ... (other parameters)

        """
        # (the existing code remains untouched, but 'total' should be initialized here)

        # Initialize the 'total' attribute
        self.total = total

        # (the existing code remains untouched)

    def __len__(self):
        return getattr(self, "total", 0) if self.iterable is None else \
               (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
                else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
                else getattr(self, "total", 0))
```

In the corrected code, the `__init__` method now initializes the 'total' attribute, and the `__len__` method is modified to handle the case when 'total' may not be present, returning 0 in such cases.
