The error message indicates that the "tqdm" object has no attribute 'total' when the boolean operation "assert t" is performed, which is a result of the "__len__" method trying to access the 'total' attribute.

The potential error location within the problematic function is near the end of the function, where the "__len__" method is being defined. It tries to return the 'total' attribute if 'iterable' is None, but if 'iterable' is not None, it tries to access 'iterable.shape[0]' which may lead to an AttributeError if 'iterable' does not have the 'shape' attribute.

The bug occurred because the "__len__" method is trying to access the 'total' attribute of the "tqdm" object, but this attribute is not defined in the "__init__" method and needs to be added.

To fix the bug, the '__init__' method needs to define the 'total' attribute so that it can be accessed by the "__len__" method. Additionally, it's also necessary to check if the 'iterable' has the 'shape' attribute before attempting to access it in the "__len__" method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
                 file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
                 miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
                 unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
                 bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
                 unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
        """
        Parameters
        ----------
        iterable  : iterable, optional
            Iterable to decorate with a progressbar.
            Leave blank to manually manage the updates.
        desc  : str, optional
            Prefix for the progressbar.
        total  : int, optional
            The number of expected iterations. If unspecified,
            len(iterable) is used if possible. As a last resort, only basic
            progress statistics are displayed (no ETA, no progressbar).
            If `gui` is True and this parameter needs subsequent updating,
            specify an initial arbitrary large positive integer,
            e.g. int(9e9).
        # ... omitted code ...
        """
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.desc = desc or ''
        self.total = total  # Define 'total' attribute
        # ... omitted code ...

    # Ensure 'shape' attribute exists before accessing
    def __len__(self):
        if self.iterable is None:
            return self.total
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
By defining the 'total' attribute in the "__init__" method, any subsequent calls to '__len__' will be able to access the 'total' attribute, thus resolving the issue presented by the error message.
