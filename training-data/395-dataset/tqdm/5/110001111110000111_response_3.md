The error seems to be occurring when the `tqdm` object is created with `disable=True` and then converted to a boolean. This results in an AttributeError because the `total` attribute is not accessible in such cases.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class. The `total` attribute is initialized but not handled properly when `disable` is set to True. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to evaluate the `tqdm` object as a boolean.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the `tqdm` object is created with `disable=True`, it should simply return False when evaluated as a boolean, as it is disabled and not representing any progress.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition in the `__init__` method to handle the case when `disable` is set to True. In this case, the `tqdm` object should simply return False when evaluated as a boolean.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    ... (existing docstring) ...
    """

    if file is None:
        file = sys.stderr

    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        return False

    # rest of the __init__ method remains unchanged
```

In this corrected code, the `disable` condition has been added at the beginning of the `__init__` method. When `disable` is True, it sets the necessary attributes and returns False, indicating that the `tqdm` object is disabled.
