The error occurs when the `tqdm` object is created with `disable=True` and then converted to a boolean using the `bool()` function. This is causing an AttributeError because the `tqdm` object does not have the `total` attribute when `disable=True`.

The potential error location within the code is the `__len__` function, which is responsible for returning the `total` attribute if the iterable is `None`.

The reason behind the bug is that when `disable=True`, the `tqdm` object is not supposed to have the `total` attribute, as it is not meant to display a progress bar.

To fix this bug, the `__len__` function should check if `disable` is `True`, and if it is, return `0` or some default value instead of trying to access the `total` attribute. Additionally, when the `tqdm` object is created with `disable=True`, it should not perform operations related to progress tracking.

Here is the corrected `__init__` function for the `tqdm` class that handles the `total` attribute depending on the value of `disable`:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):

    # ...

    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        self.total = None  # Set total to None when disable is True
        return

    if kwargs:
        self.disable = True
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        raise (TqdmDeprecationWarning("""\
`nested` is deprecated and automated. Use position instead for manual control.
""", fp_write=getattr(file, 'write', sys.stderr.write)) if "nested" in kwargs
                else TqdmKeyError("Unknown argument(s): " + str(kwargs)))

    # Preprocess the arguments
    if total is None and iterable is not None:
        try:
            total = len(iterable)
        except (TypeError, AttributeError):
            total = None

    # ...

    if not disable:
        self.total = total  # Only set total if disable is False
```
In the corrected code, `self.total` is set to `None` when `disable` is `True`, and it is only assigned the value of `total` if `disable` is `False`. This ensures that the `total` attribute is not accessed when it should not be.
