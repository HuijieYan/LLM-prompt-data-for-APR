The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `self.iterable` attribute in the `__init__` method. The `iterable` parameter is optional but the code does not handle the case where it is not provided. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code assumes the iterable parameter will always be provided, and does not handle the case where it is not provided. This can lead to potential errors when the iterable parameter is omitted.

To fix the bug, we should handle the case where the iterable parameter is not provided by adding a check for its existence and setting the `self.iterable` attribute to `None` if it is not provided.

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    # Handle the case where iterable is not provided
    if iterable is None:
        self.iterable = None
    else:
        self.iterable = iterable
    
    # rest of the __init__ method remains unchanged
```
By including this check, we are handling the case where the `iterable` parameter is not provided, and ensuring that `self.iterable` is set to `None` in that case.
