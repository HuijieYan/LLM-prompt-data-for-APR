The error occurs when converting a tqdm object to a boolean to test for existence. If the tqdm object was created with `disable=True`, it results in an AttributeError when evaluated as boolean.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__init__` method, where the `disable` parameter is checked, and the `iterable` and `disable` attributes are set.

The reason behind this bug is that when `disable` is set to `True`, the function returns without setting the required attributes, leading to the AttributeError when trying to evaluate the tqdm object as a boolean.

The approach to fixing the bug would be to ensure that the required attributes are properly set even when `disable` is `True`. This can be done by checking for `disable` at the start of the method, and immediately returning with the necessary attribute assignments.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
                 file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
                 miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
                 unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
                 bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
                 unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        return

    # Rest of the method to initialize other attributes
    # ...
```

By adding the `if disable` check at the beginning of the `__init__` method, the bug can be fixed and the tqdm object can be evaluated as a boolean without resulting in an AttributeError.
