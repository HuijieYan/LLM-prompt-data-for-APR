The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` creates three paths, each consisting of two points and a stop code. These paths are then passed as arguments to the `Path.make_compound_path` method. The assertion error occurs because the sum of the boolean array returned by the comparison `compound_path.codes == Path.STOP` is not equal to 1 as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the loop that sets the codes for the compound path. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of indices and setting the correct code values for the compound path.

The bug occurs because the loop in the `make_compound_path` method does not handle the setting of codes for different paths correctly. It incorrectly calculates and sets the codes for the compound path, resulting in incorrect values of the `codes` array.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the calculation of indices and setting the correct code values for the compound path within the loop. This may involve keeping track of the cumulative index for each path and setting the code values accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code, we concatenate both the vertices and codes from all the paths in the `args` and create a new compound path with the concatenated vertices and codes. This ensures that the correct vertices and codes are combined to form the compound path.
