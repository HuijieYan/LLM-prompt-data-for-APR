The issue description is:

```text
... in favor of the corresponding ones in path.py.
(Strictly speaking, make_path_regular is closer to
cleaned(remove_nans=False) but in practice cleaned() works equally
well.)

Note that we may want to deprecate the STOP code, which is documented as "not required and ignored" but actually causes the rest of the path to be dropped silently; it gets appended by cleaned() and caused an earlier version of this PR to break (because the STOP would then cause the rest of the concatenated path to be dropped).
