The test function `test_make_compound_path_stops()` initializes three `Path` objects, each with a list `[zero, zero]` and the associated codes `[Path.MOVETO, Path.STOP]`. It then calls the `Path.make_compound_path(*paths)` method. Finally, it checks whether the sum of codes in the `compound_path` object that equals `Path.STOP` is equal to 1.

The error message indicates that the sum calculated was 3 instead of 1, which is incorrect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the loop that tries to concatenate the vertices and codes of the `Path` objects passed as arguments.

The bug occurs because, with each `path` object, the loop is incorrectly setting codes without considering the previous codes. Instead, it makes explicit assumptions about the structure of the `path` object.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to correctly initialize the `codes` array by considering the previous codes and the indices at which the codes should be inserted based on the lengths of the vertices.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
    # Concatenate the vertices and calculate the cumulative lengths to adjust the codes
    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])

    # Adjust the codes based on the cumulative lengths of the vertices
    code_lengths = [len(x.vertices) for x in args]
    new_codes = []
    for i, (code, length) in enumerate(zip(codes, code_lengths)):
        if code == cls.MOVETO:
            new_codes.append(code)
        else:
            new_codes.extend([cls.LINETO] * (length - 1))
    
    return cls(vertices, new_codes)
```
