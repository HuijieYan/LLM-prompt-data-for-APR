The problem with the provided function `make_compound_path` is that it is trying to define two separate methods with the same name (`vertices` and `codes`) within the `Path` class, which is not possible in Python. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is attempting to define multiple methods with the same name, which is not allowed in Python.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `make_compound_path` function to concatenate vertices and codes properly and create a new Path object with the concatenated vertices and codes.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    import numpy as np
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return cls(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    all_vertices = [x.vertices for x in args]
    all_codes = [x.codes for x in args]

    vertices = np.concatenate(all_vertices)
    codes = np.concatenate(all_codes)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code, we are concatenating all the vertices and codes from the list of Path objects passed as arguments. Then, we are creating a new Path object with the concatenated vertices and codes.
