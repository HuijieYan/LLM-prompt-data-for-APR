The error occurs because the implementation of the `make_compound_path` function does not handle the `STOP` code properly. The bug is likely in the part of the code that handles the `STOP` code.

The code should be updated to properly handle the `STOP` code. The `STOP` code is documented as "not required and ignored" but actually causes the rest of the path to be dropped silently. As a result, the implementation should ignore the `STOP` code when concatenating paths.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to ignore the `STOP` code and concatenate the paths properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes[-1] != cls.STOP else x.codes[:-1] for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

With this correction, the `STOP` code will be properly handled, and the `make_compound_path` function should work as expected.

This fix addresses the bug by properly handling the `STOP` code and concatenating the path codes.
