The error is occurring because the `make_compound_path` method is not correctly concatenating the vertices and codes of the input paths. The `codes` array is not being assigned properly in the loop that iterates over the input paths.

The bug is happening because the loop is incorrectly assigning the codes array. Additionally, the condition for handling path codes that are None is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the loop to correctly assign the codes and handle the case when path codes are None.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else [cls.MOVETO, cls.LINETO] * (len(x.vertices) - 1) for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

With this correction, the `codes` array is properly concatenated and the handling of None path codes is addressed. This should fix the bug and the associated test case.
