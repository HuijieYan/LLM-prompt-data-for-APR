Potential error: The function is attempting to access the `code_type` attribute of the class `cls`, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code.

Reason for the bug: The `code_type` attribute is not defined within the function, which causes a NameError when the function is executed.

Approach for fixing the bug: Define the `code_type` attribute within the function or as a class attribute to resolve the NameError.

Corrected code:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=np.uint8)  # Assuming code_type is a uint8
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code, the `code_type` has been replaced with `np.uint8`, assuming that `code_type` represents a data type for the `codes` array. This change resolves the potential NameError and provides a working definition for the `codes` array.
