The bug is occurring in the loop that tries to concatenate the vertices and codes from the input paths. The loop is not handling the indices correctly, and it is resulting in incorrect assignment of codes and vertices, leading to an incorrect final result.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the loop that iterates over the input paths and correctly concatenate the vertices and codes. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the input path's codes are None.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else [cls.MOVETO, cls.LINETO] * (len(x.vertices)//2) for x in args])
    
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
