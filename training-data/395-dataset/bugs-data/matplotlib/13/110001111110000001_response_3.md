The buggy function `make_compound_path` is supposed to create a compound path from a list of Path objects. The test function `test_make_compound_path_stops` tries to create a compound path from three Path objects and then checks if the code array contains the value `Path.STOP` exactly once.

The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` function is the incorrect assignment of the codes for each path. It seems that the logic for appending the codes for each path is incorrect, leading to the wrong summation of the `Path.STOP` value.

The bug occurs because the index `i` is incremented for every path, but it's also used to assign codes for each path without any reset. This results in incorrect code assignments and leads to a wrong count of `Path.STOP` in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `i` index should be reset and recalculated for each path iteration, ensuring that the correct codes are assigned to the compound path without overwriting or skipping any codes.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([np.asarray([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices) - 1)) if path.codes is None else path.codes for path in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code, the constants `cls.MOVETO` and `cls.LINETO` are used to create the codes for each path, and the codes are concatenated properly to form the compound path. The `i` index is removed, and the code assignment is simplified. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
