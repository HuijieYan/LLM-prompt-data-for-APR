The test case is trying to create a compound path and check if the sum of the compound path's codes is equal to `Path.STOP` value.

The error message indicates that the sum of the compound path's codes is not equal to `Path.STOP`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of the codes for the compound path.

The bug occurs because the logic for assigning codes to the compound path is incorrect. The wrong indexing and assignment of codes within the loop causes the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the codes for the compound path.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])  # Concatenate codes from all paths
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code, instead of manually assigning individual codes from each path, we are using `np.concatenate` to combine all the codes from the individual paths into one consolidated array of codes for the compound path. This should fix the issue.
