The bug in the `make_compound_path` method is that the `codes` array is not being populated correctly. The `codes` array needs to be updated with the codes from each individual path in the `args` tuple.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case when the `codes` attribute of a `Path` object is `None`. 

To fix the bug:
- Check if the `path.codes` attribute is `None`, and if so, populate the `codes` array with `cls.MOVETO` and `cls.LINETO` codes accordingly.
- Update the index `i` correctly as the loop iterates over the paths in `args`.
- Concatenate the codes from each path in the `args` tuple to populate the `codes` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = []
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes.extend([cls.MOVETO, cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices) - 1))
        else:
            codes.extend(path.codes)
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

With these changes, the `codes` array will be correctly populated with the codes from each individual path in the `args` tuple, and the method will return the expected compound `Path` object.
