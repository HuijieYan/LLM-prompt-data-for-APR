The test function `test_make_compound_path_stops` is trying to create a compound path from a list of paths and then check if the sum of `compound_path.codes` is equal to `Path.STOP`. However, the error message indicates that the assertion `assert np.sum(compound_path.codes == Path.STOP) == 1` is failing, showing that the sum is not equal to 1.

The bug is likely located in the `make_compound_path` method of the `Path` class, specifically in the part where the `codes` of the compound path are being calculated. The issue seems to stem from incorrect code assignments within the loop for combining the codes of individual paths.

The bug occurs because the codes for the individual paths are not being correctly concatenated to form the codes for the compound path. This results in the wrong sum of `compound_path.codes`.

To fix the bug, the loop that combines the codes of individual paths needs to be modified to correctly assign the codes to the compound path.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([np.asarray([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO]*(len(path.vertices)-1), dtype=cls.code_type) for path in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
