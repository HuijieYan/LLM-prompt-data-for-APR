The error is likely to be located within the `make_compound_path` function. The bug occurs due to incorrect concatenation of vertices and incorrect assignment of codes within the loop. This results in the incorrect size of the `codes` array and leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the vertices and codes are concatenated correctly and that the codes are assigned to the correct indices within the `codes` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([None if x.codes is None else x.codes for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

This corrected code ensures that the vertices and codes are concatenated properly, and if the `codes` array for a path is None, it is replaced with None in the concatenated `codes` array. This fixes the bug and ensures that the `make_compound_path` function works as expected.
