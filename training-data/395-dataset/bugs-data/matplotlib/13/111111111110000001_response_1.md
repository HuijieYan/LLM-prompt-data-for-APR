The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` is calling the `make_compound_path` method of the `Path` class. This method is used to create a compound path from a list of `Path` objects. It concatenates the vertices and codes from the input paths, and then returns a new `Path` object containing the concatenated vertices and codes.

The error message indicates that the `assert` statement is failing because the sum of `compound_path.codes == Path.STOP` is not equal to 1. This means that the `make_compound_path` method is not correctly setting the `STOP` code in the concatenated `codes` array.

The potential error location is within the loop that populates the `codes` array. The bug is likely to be related to the logic that sets the `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes when the input path does not have explicit codes.

The bug occurs because the code is assuming that the input paths have explicit `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes, and it's incorrectly populating the codes array. The loop is not correctly separating the `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes when the input path does not have explicit codes.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add separate logic to correctly handle the case when the input path does not have explicit codes. This may involve setting the `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes based on the vertices of the input paths.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args]) if all(x.codes is not None for x in args) else None

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code, we're concatenating the `vertices` and `codes` directly from the input paths. If the input paths do not have explicit codes, we're setting the `codes` array to `None`, indicating that it should be interpreted as a series of `MOVETO` followed by `LINETO`. This will handle the case where the input paths do not have explicit codes correctly.
