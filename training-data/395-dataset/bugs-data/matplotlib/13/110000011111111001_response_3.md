The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` is trying to create a compound path from three Path objects and then asserts that the sum of `compound_path.codes` is equal to `Path.STOP`.

The error occurs because the buggy function `make_compound_path` is not correctly aggregating the codes from the input Path objects. This is resulting in an incorrect sum of `compound_path.codes`.

The bug occurs because the indexing within the loop that assigns codes to the `codes` array is incorrect. It should be using slicing to correctly place the codes in the array.

To fix the bug, the loop that iterates over the input paths should have the correct logic to assign codes to the `codes` array based on whether `path.codes` is None or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else [cls.MOVETO, cls.STOP] for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
