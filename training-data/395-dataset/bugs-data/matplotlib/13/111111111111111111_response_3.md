The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` is checking if the sum of `compound_path.codes` where `compound_path.codes` is equal to `Path.STOP` is equal to 1. However, the error message shows that the sum is equal to 3, which indicates a failure in the test.

The potential error location is within the `make_compound_path` method, particularly in the loop where the `codes` array is being populated for each path. 

The bug occurs because the loop is not correctly appending the codes for each path to the `codes` array. It is overwriting the codes for each path instead of properly concatenating them, leading to the incorrect result when checking for the sum.

To fix the bug, the `make_compound_path` method needs to correctly concatenate the vertices and codes of each path to create a compound path with the correct vertices and codes.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

By correctly concatenating the vertices and codes arrays for each path, the `make_compound_path` method will now generate the compound path with the correct vertices and codes. This should resolve the issues observed in the test case.
