The bug occurs in the make_compound_path function. The function is concatenating the vertices and codes of the input Path objects, but it is not handling the code types properly, resulting in incorrect concatenation.

The buggy function is concatenating the codes of each Path object without taking into account the relative position of the vertices in the concatenated array. This leads to incorrect codes being assigned to the concatenated vertices.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly concatenate the vertices and codes of the input Path objects, ensuring that the codes are assigned to the corresponding vertices in the concatenated array. Additionally, the function should handle the case when the codes of a Path object are None, and adjust the codes accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the make_compound_path function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32), np.empty([0], dtype=cls.code_type))
    
    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    codes_list = [x.codes if x.codes is not None else np.full(len(x.vertices), cls.LINETO, dtype=cls.code_type) for x in args]
    
    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)
    codes = np.concatenate(codes_list)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code, we first collect the vertices and codes of all the Path objects into separate lists. If the codes of a Path object are None, we create an array of LINETO codes of the same length as the vertices. Then, we concatenate the vertices and codes from the lists to create the final vertices and codes arrays for the compound path. This ensures that the codes are assigned to the correct vertices in the concatenated array.
