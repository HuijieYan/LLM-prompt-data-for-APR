The bug is caused by the incorrect iteration over the vertices and codes of the Path objects in the make_compound_path function. The code incorrectly concatenates the vertices and incorrectly assigns the codes array.

To fix this bug, we need to iterate over the vertices and codes of the Path objects correctly and concatenate the values into the vertices and codes arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the make_compound_path function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    import numpy as np
    
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    codes_list = [x.codes for x in args if x.codes is not None else np.full(len(x.vertices), cls.LINETO, dtype=cls.code_type) for x in args]
    
    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)
    codes = np.concatenate(codes_list)
    
    return Path(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code:
1. We first create lists for vertices and codes from the Path objects, and handle the case where codes is None by creating an array filled with LINETO values.
2. Then we concatenate the vertices and codes lists to form the final vertices and codes arrays.
3. Finally, we create a new Path object using the concatenated vertices and codes arrays.

This approach ensures that the vertices and codes are correctly concatenated and assigned, fixing the bug in the original function.
