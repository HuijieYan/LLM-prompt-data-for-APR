The potential error in the given function `make_compound_path` is the incorrect handling of vertices and codes when concatenating multiple `Path` objects.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `make_compound_path` is not correctly handling the concatenation of vertices and codes from multiple `Path` objects.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly concatenate the vertices and codes from all the `Path` objects passed as arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    num_vertices = sum(len(x.vertices) for x in args)
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])

    # Update MOVETO codes if needed
    start_idx = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[start_idx] = cls.MOVETO
            start_idx += len(path.vertices)
        else:
            start_idx += len(path.codes)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected function, `num_vertices` is used to calculate the number of vertices in the concatenated array. The function also properly handles the concatenation of codes from multiple `Path` objects and updates the `MOVETO` code when needed.
