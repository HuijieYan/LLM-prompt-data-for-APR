The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` creates three Path objects with the same vertex and code containing the value `Path.STOP`. The buggy function `make_compound_path` concatenates the vertices and codes of the input Path objects. Then it iterates over each Path object to update and concatenate the codes array based on the current Path's codes and vertices.

The bug occurs when updating the codes array within the for loop. The initial condition `if path.codes is None` is misleading as the codes array is not checked for None, and hence incorrect assignments are made, causing the failure in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the case when `path.codes` is None and the correct positions for `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes should be determined.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else [cls.MOVETO, cls.STOP] for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
