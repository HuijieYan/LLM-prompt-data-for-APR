The error occurs because the `make_compound_path` function is not correctly concatenating the vertices and codes of the input paths, leading to an incorrect result when checking for the presence of `STOP` in the compound path.

The bug is likely occurring in the loop that iterates over the input paths to concatenate their vertices and codes into the compound path.

To fix the bug, we need to properly concatenate the vertices and codes of each input path in the `make_compound_path` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

With this correction, the `make_compound_path` function should correctly concatenate the vertices and codes of the input paths, and the test case should pass without errors.
