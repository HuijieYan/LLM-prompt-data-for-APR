The error occurs because the `make_compound_path` function incorrectly calculates the `codes` array. The `codes` array should represent the drawing commands for the vertices, but the current implementation does not handle the `MOVETO` and `LINETO` commands correctly.

The bug occurs when the `codes` array is being constructed. The `codes` array is filled with the command for the entire list of vertices, which is incorrect. Instead, the `codes` array should be constructed based on the individual paths in the input.

To fix the bug, we need to loop through each path in the input and add the command for each individual path to the `codes` array. Additionally, for paths with no command codes (`path.codes is None`), the function should use `cls.MOVETO` and `cls.LINETO` commands to fill the `codes` array.

Here's the corrected function for `make_compound_path`:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = []
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes.append(cls.MOVETO)
            codes.extend([cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices) - 1))
        else:
            codes.extend(path.codes)
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, np.array(codes, dtype=cls.code_type))
```

With this correction, the `codes` array will correctly represent the individual drawing commands for each path in the input, and the test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` should pass without errors.
