The bug in the `make_compound_path` method is related to the incorrect handling of the `codes` array. In the buggy function, when `path.codes` is not None, the codes array is updated starting at index `i`, but the ending index is not calculated correctly. This results in incorrect assignment of `codes` array and `i` variable.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the indexing and updating of the `codes` array.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = []
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes.extend([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices)-1))
        else:
            codes.extend(path.codes)
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

The changes made include:
- Changing the `codes` array from a numpy array to a Python list. This allows us to use the `extend` method to concatenate the codes from different paths.
- Updated the logic to handle the `codes` array concatenation and indexing correctly.
