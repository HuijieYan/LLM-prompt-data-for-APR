The test `test_make_compound_path_stops` creates a list `paths` containing 3 instances of the `Path` class, each with 2 vertices and 2 codes (MOVETO and STOP). It then calls the `make_compound_path` class method to combine these instances into a compound path and checks if the sum of `STOP` codes in the resulting `compound_path` is 1.

The error message indicates that the sum of `STOP` codes in the `compound_path` is 3, which is unexpected.

The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` method is where it handles the case for a Path with no codes (`path.codes is None`). Here, it assigns the `cls.MOVETO` code to `codes[i]` and `cls.LINETO` codes to the subsequent positions in the `codes` array, which is incorrect.

The bug is occurring because when handling a Path with no codes, the `make_compound_path` method incorrectly assigns the MOVETO and LINETO code types directly to the `codes` array without considering the correct sequence and positioning of these code types.

To fix the bug, the `make_compound_path` method should update the `i` index correctly and handle the case of no codes in the if-else loop to assign the codes correctly according to the positions of the vertices.

Below is the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    codes_list = [x.codes for x in args]

    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)
    num_codes = np.array([len(x) if x is not None else 0 for x in codes_list])
    num_vertices = np.array([len(x) for x in vertices_list])

    codes = np.empty(sum(num_vertices) + len(args) - num_codes.sum(), dtype=cls.code_type)

    indices = np.insert(np.cumsum(num_vertices) + np.arange(len(args) - 1), 0, 0)
    i = 0
    for path, v, c in zip(args, indices, num_vertices):
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + c] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
        i += c + 1  # update the starting index for codes of the next Path

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
With this corrected code, the `make_compound_path` method correctly combines the vertices and codes from the input `Path` objects, ensuring that the codes are assigned in their correct positions and sequence based on the vertices.
