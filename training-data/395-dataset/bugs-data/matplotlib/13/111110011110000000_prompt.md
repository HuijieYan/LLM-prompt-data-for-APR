# Buggy function source code
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Path():
    """
    A series of possibly disconnected, possibly closed, line and curve
    segments.
    
    The underlying storage is made up of two parallel numpy arrays:
    
    - *vertices*: an Nx2 float array of vertices
    - *codes*: an N-length uint8 array of vertex types, or None
    
    These two arrays always have the same length in the first
    dimension.  For example, to represent a cubic curve, you must
    provide three vertices as well as three codes ``CURVE3``.
    
    The code types are:
    
    - ``STOP``   :  1 vertex (ignored)
        A marker for the end of the entire path (currently not required and
        ignored)
    
    - ``MOVETO`` :  1 vertex
        Pick up the pen and move to the given vertex.
    
    - ``LINETO`` :  1 vertex
        Draw a line from the current position to the given vertex.
    
    - ``CURVE3`` :  1 control point, 1 endpoint
        Draw a quadratic Bezier curve from the current position, with the given
        control point, to the given end point.
    
    - ``CURVE4`` :  2 control points, 1 endpoint
        Draw a cubic Bezier curve from the current position, with the given
        control points, to the given end point.
    
    - ``CLOSEPOLY`` : 1 vertex (ignored)
        Draw a line segment to the start point of the current polyline.
    
    If *codes* is None, it is interpreted as a ``MOVETO`` followed by a series
    of ``LINETO``.
    
    Users of Path objects should not access the vertices and codes arrays
    directly.  Instead, they should use `iter_segments` or `cleaned` to get the
    vertex/code pairs.  This helps, in particular, to consistently handle the
    case of *codes* being None.
    
    Some behavior of Path objects can be controlled by rcParams. See the
    rcParams whose keys start with 'path.'.
    
    .. note::
    
        The vertices and codes arrays should be treated as
        immutable -- there are a number of optimizations and assumptions
        made up front in the constructor that will not change when the
        data changes.
