The error is likely occurring in the `make_compound_path` function. It seems that the `codes` array is not being properly updated based on the input paths.

The for loop in the `make_compound_path` function iterates over the input `args` and tries to concatenate the vertices and update the `codes` array. However, the logic for updating the `codes` array seems to be incorrect.

The issue is related to how the `codes` array is being updated for each input path. It appears that the code is not correctly handling the case where `path.codes` is None. 

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for updating the `codes` array based on the `path.codes` attribute. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `path.codes` is None by correctly setting the codes for the vertices.

Here's the corrected `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else np.full(len(x.vertices), cls.LINETO) for x in args])
    
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

With these changes, the `codes` array is correctly updated based on the input paths, handling both cases where `codes` are available and when they are None.
