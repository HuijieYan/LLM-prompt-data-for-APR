The error occurs in the `test_make_compound_path_stops` function, where the assertion `assert np.sum(compound_path.codes == Path.STOP) == 1` fails. The error message indicates that the sum of `compound_path.codes` does not equal 1.

The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` function is the section where `cls.MOVETO` and `cls.STOP` codes are assigned to the `codes` array for each path. It seems that the logic for handling the codes is incorrect.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic for handling the `codes` array during the concatenation of multiple Path objects is incorrect. The handling of `MOVETO` and `STOP` codes is causing the incorrect behavior.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to correctly handle the `MOVETO` and `STOP` codes for each Path object when concatenating them to form the compound path. Additionally, the logic for assigning the codes for each Path object needs to be reviewed and corrected.

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else np.full(len(x.vertices), cls.LINETO) for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code, we concatenate the `vertices` for all Path objects and then concatenate the `codes` for all Path objects. We also handle the case where `codes` is None for a Path object and replace it with the `LINETO` code for each vertex. This ensures that the compound path is constructed with the correct vertices and codes from the input Path objects.
