The issue seems to be related to the make_compound_path function in the provided code. The function is trying to concatenate the vertices and codes of multiple Path objects, but the implementation seems to be incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the concatenation of vertices and codes is not being handled correctly, and the logic for handling the code types is flawed.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to iterate through the Path objects and concatenate their vertices and codes separately. Then, properly handle the code types based on the length of each Path's codes array.

Here's the corrected code for the make_compound_path function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32), np.empty(0, dtype=cls.code_type))
    
    concatenated_vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    
    concatenated_codes = []
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            concatenated_codes.append(cls.MOVETO)
            concatenated_codes.extend([cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices) - 1))
        else:
            concatenated_codes.extend(path.codes)

    return cls(concatenated_vertices, np.array(concatenated_codes, dtype=cls.code_type))
```

This corrected code properly concatenates the vertices and codes arrays from the Path objects and handles the code types based on the length of each Path's codes array.
