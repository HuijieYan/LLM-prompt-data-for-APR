The bug in the provided code is that the `make_compound_path` function is trying to access the `vertices` and `codes` attributes as if they were methods, but they are actually properties. This is causing an AttributeError because the properties are being accessed as methods.

To fix this bug, the `vertices` and `codes` properties should be accessed directly without the method call syntax.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
    @classmethod
    def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
        """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
        # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
        if not args:
            return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
        vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
        codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
        i = 0
        for path in args:
            if path.codes is None:
                codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
                codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
            else:
                codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            i += len(path.vertices)
    
        return cls(vertices, codes)
```
