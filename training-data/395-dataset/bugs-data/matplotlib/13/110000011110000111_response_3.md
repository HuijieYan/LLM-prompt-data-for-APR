The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` creates a list of Path objects and then calls the `make_compound_path` method to create a compound path from the list. It then checks if the number of STOP codes in the compound path is equal to 1, but the assertion fails.

The error message indicates that the sum of `compound_path.codes` equaling `Path.STOP` is not equal to 1, and it shows the actual sum as 3.

The issue is likely in the calculation of the number of STOP codes in the compound path. The bug is likely related to how the `codes` array for the compound path is being constructed within the `make_compound_path` method.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling the `codes` array so that it correctly combines the codes from the input paths and calculates the number of STOP codes in the compound path.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code, we concatenate the vertices and codes from all the input paths to create the vertices and codes arrays for the compound path. This should ensure that the compound path is constructed correctly with the combined vertices and codes from the input paths.
