The bug seems to be occurring in the loop that iterates over the 'args' list and updates the 'codes' array. In the 'if' and 'else' branches of the loop, the indexing for updating the 'codes' array is incorrect. This results in incorrect values being assigned to the 'codes' array.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the index properly while assigning the values to the 'codes' array. Additionally, making sure that the iterations within the loop are done correctly is important.

Here's the corrected code for the 'make_compound_path' function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            i += 1
            codes[i:i + len(path.vertices) - 1] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
