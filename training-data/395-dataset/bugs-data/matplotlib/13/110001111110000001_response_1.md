1. The test case aims to create a compound path from three instances of the Path class, with each path consisting of two points and a STOP code. The test then checks if there is exactly one instance of STOP code in the compound path.

2. The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` function is in the loop that updates the `codes` array. Specifically, the assignment `codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO` would not correctly update the array due to the incorrect slicing.

3. The bug occurs because the loop used to update the `codes` array does not correctly handle cases where the `path` object does not have any `codes`. As a result, incorrect slicing and assignments lead to unexpected behavior in the `codes` array.

4. To fix the bug, the loop should be adjusted to correctly update the `codes` array based on the `path` objects. Additionally, the handling of paths without `codes` should be improved to avoid incorrect slicing and assignment.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
            i += len(path.vertices)
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            i += len(path.codes)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code, the loop has been modified to handle paths without `codes`, and the slicing for updating the `codes` array has been adjusted to correctly assign the codes based on the length of either `path.codes` or `path.vertices`.
