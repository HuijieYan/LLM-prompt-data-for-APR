The `make_compound_path` method is supposed to create a compound path from a list of Path objects. The bug seems to be in the manipulation of the `codes` array within the for loop.

The potential error location seems to be the way the `codes` array is manipulated in the for loop. It appears that the loop is not correctly handling paths with codes and is not incrementing the index `i` properly.

The bug is occurring because the logic inside the for loop is not correctly handling paths with codes. When a path has codes, the loop should be updating the `codes` array and the index incrementation should account for the length of the codes in the path.

To fix the bug, you can update the code inside the for loop to properly handle paths with codes and correctly increment the index `i` based on the length of the vertices and codes in each path.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
            i += len(path.vertices) + 1  # Increment i by length of vertices plus 1 for MOVETO
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            i += len(path.vertices)  # Increment i by length of vertices

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

With this correction, the method should now correctly handle paths with codes and increment the index `i` properly based on the length of vertices and codes in each path. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
