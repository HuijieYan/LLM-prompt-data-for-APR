Potential error location:
The error might be occurring in the logic where the `codes` array is being constructed based on the input `Path` objects.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug could be due to the incorrect assignment of `codes` array elements based on the input `Path` objects. Additionally, there might be issues with handling the `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `codes` array is initialized and populated correctly based on the input `Path` objects.
2. Verify the logic for handling `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes and ensure that the assignment is done accurately.
3. Check for any inconsistencies in the handling of `Path` objects that could lead to incorrect construction of the compound path.

Corrected code:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = []
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes.extend([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices) - 1))
        else:
            codes.extend(path.codes)
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
