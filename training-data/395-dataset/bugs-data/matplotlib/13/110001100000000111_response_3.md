Issue:
The make_compound_path method in the provided code contains potential issues such as incorrect array slicing and incorrect handling of the codes array.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The code tries to concatenate the vertices of multiple Path objects without considering the total length of the vertices array.
2. The handling of the codes array is incorrect, and the logic for assigning codes to the concatenated path is flawed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Calculate the total length of vertices before concatenating them to ensure proper array dimensions.
2. Revise the logic for assigning codes to the concatenated path to ensure it aligns with the concatenated vertices.

Corrected code for the make_compound_path method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    total_vertices_length = sum(len(path.vertices) for path in args)
    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])

    codes = np.empty(total_vertices_length, dtype=cls.code_type)

    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
With these changes, the make_compound_path method is fixed to properly concatenate the vertices and handle the codes array, addressing the issues present in the original code.
