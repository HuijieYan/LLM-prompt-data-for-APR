The error in the code seems to be related to the manipulation of the `codes` array within the `make_compound_path` method. The `codes` array is being modified based on the lengths of the `vertices` and `path.codes` arrays, but the logic for this manipulation seems to be incorrect.

The bug is likely causing issues in creating the `codes` array with the correct values, leading to unexpected behavior when creating the compound path.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the `codes` array is generated based on the input `Path` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)

    codes_list = [np.concatenate(([cls.MOVETO], np.full(len(path.vertices) - 1, cls.LINETO))) if path.codes is None else path.codes for path in args]
    codes = np.concatenate(codes_list)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code, we concatenate the `vertices` and `codes` arrays separately based on the input `Path` objects. For `codes`, we use `np.full` to create an array filled with the `LINETO` code for the remaining vertices if the `path.codes` is `None`.

This should fix the bug and correctly generate the compound path based on the input `Path` objects.
