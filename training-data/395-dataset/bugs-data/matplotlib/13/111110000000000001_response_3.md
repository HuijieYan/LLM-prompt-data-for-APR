The potential error in the `make_compound_path` function is that it is trying to access the `vertices` and `codes` attributes directly from the `Path` objects without calling the methods to retrieve them. This can lead to unexpected behavior as those attributes may not be directly accessible.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `make_compound_path` function to call the `vertices` and `codes` methods on the `Path` objects to retrieve the vertices and codes arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    import numpy as np
    
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    all_vertices = []
    all_codes = []
    for path in args:
        vertices = path.vertices()
        codes = path.codes()
        if codes is None:
            codes = [cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(vertices) - 1)
        all_vertices.extend(vertices)
        all_codes.extend(codes)

    return Path(np.array(all_vertices), np.array(all_codes))
```

In this corrected code, we loop through each `Path` object in the `args` list and use the `vertices` and `codes` methods to retrieve the vertices and codes arrays. Then we concatenate all the vertices and codes arrays and create a new `Path` object from the combined vertices and codes.
