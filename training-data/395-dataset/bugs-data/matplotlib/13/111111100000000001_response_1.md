The error in the `make_compound_path` method is that it is trying to access the `vertices`, `codes`, and `code_type` attributes as if they were class attributes, but they are actually instance attributes.

The bug occurred because the method is trying to access the attributes using the class name `cls` instead of accessing them through the instance of `Path`.

To fix the bug, we need to access the instance attributes of the `Path` class and remove the unnecessary class method decorators. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def make_compound_path(*args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=args[0].code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = path.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = path.LINETO
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return Path(vertices, codes)
```
In the corrected code, the `make_compound_path` function is defined without the `@classmethod` decorator. Additionally, the instance attributes like `code_type`, `MOVETO`, and `LINETO` are accessed through the instance `path` instead of the class `cls`.
