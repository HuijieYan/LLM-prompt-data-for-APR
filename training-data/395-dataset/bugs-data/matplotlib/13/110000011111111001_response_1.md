The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` creates three `Path` objects, each containing two vertices at `[0, 0]` and corresponding codes for `MOVETO` and `STOP`. It then calls the `make_compound_path` method on the `Path` class with these three `Path` objects and asserts that the sum of `compound_path` codes equal to `Path.STOP` is 1. However, the assertion fails because the sum is 3, indicating that the `make_compound_path` method is not generating the correct codes for the compound path.

The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` method is identified in the section where it processes the codes of individual paths. It calculates the indices for concatenating the codes but does not seem to handle the cases where the code types are different or the path codes are None.

The current logic in the code for generating compound path codes does not handle the scenario when the individual path codes are None. It also incorrectly assigns codes and does not account for the correct indices in the compound code array.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the path has codes and handle the scenario when they are None. It should also correctly assign the codes for each subpath and concatenate them to form the compound path codes.

Here's the corrected `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    
    # Initialize an empty array for compound codes
    compound_codes = []

    for path in args:
        # If path codes are None, fill them with LINETO
        if path.codes is None:
            codes = np.empty(len(path.vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
            codes[0] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[1:] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            codes = path.codes
        compound_codes.extend(codes)

    return cls(vertices, np.array(compound_codes, dtype=cls.code_type))
```
