The bug in the given function `make_compound_path` is that it is not properly handling the case when the `codes` attribute of any of the `Path` objects in the `args` list is None.

The bug occurs because when the `codes` attribute of a `Path` object is None, the function should consider it as a series of `MOVETO` followed by a series of `LINETO` commands. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for concatenating the `vertices` and `codes` arrays when the `codes` attribute of a `Path` object is None.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else np.concatenate([[cls.MOVETO], np.full(len(x.vertices) - 1, cls.LINETO)]) for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected implementation, we use `np.concatenate` to concatenate the `vertices` and `codes` arrays, and we handle the case when the `codes` attribute is None by creating an array of `MOVETO` and `LINETO` commands accordingly.
