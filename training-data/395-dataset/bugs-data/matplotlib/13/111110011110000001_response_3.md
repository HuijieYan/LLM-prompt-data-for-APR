The test case is testing the `make_compound_path` method of the `Path` class. It constructs three paths, each containing two points and a `STOP` code. Then, it calls `make_compound_path` on these paths and checks if the number of `STOP` codes in the resulting compound path is equal to 1.

The error message indicates that the test fails because the number of `STOP` codes in the resulting compound path is 3 rather than 1.

The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` method is the logic that handles `STOP` codes for individual paths and combines them into a single `codes` array for the compound path.

Upon closer analysis, it seems that the bug occurs when handling `STOP` codes for individual paths. The logic for creating the `codes` array assumes that each individual path's code array only consists of `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes, and does not properly handle the `STOP` code. This causes incorrect processing and concatenation of the individual paths' code arrays into the final `codes` array for the compound path.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for combining the code arrays of individual paths into the compound path's code array. The logic should correctly handle all possible code types and their respective combining scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args if x.codes is not None])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

With this corrected code, the `make_compound_path` method should now properly handle the code arrays of individual paths and combine them into a single code array for the compound path.
