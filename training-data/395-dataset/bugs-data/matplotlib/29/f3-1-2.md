The issue description is:

```text
See rationale in changelog note (basically, Axes.invert_xaxis is fine
for interactive use, but a bit of a pain for library-work).

Note that xaxis_inverted is now implemented in terms of get_inverted and
invert_xaxis in terms of set_inverted, so the new methods are properly
tested.
