Potential error location: 
The potential error in this function is in the conditional statement `if dpi is not None:` where `dpi_orig` is set to `self.figure.dpi`. However, `dpi_orig` is used later to reset the figure's dpi, but it is not defined if `dpi` is `None`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug occurs because `dpi_orig` is being assigned a value from `self.figure.dpi` without checking if `dpi` is not None. This can lead to a potential `NoneType` error when trying to reset the dpi later on.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by first checking if `dpi` is not None before assigning the value of `self.figure.dpi` to `dpi_orig`. If `dpi` is None, then `dpi_orig` can be set to `None` as well. Then, we can use the `if-else` statement to handle the reset of the figure's dpi based on the value of `dpi_orig`.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
