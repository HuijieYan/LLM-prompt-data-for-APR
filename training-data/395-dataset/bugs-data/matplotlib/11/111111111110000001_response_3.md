The error occurs within the `get_window_extent` method of the `Text` class. The bug seems to be related to the usage of dpi values. The `get_window_extent` method should not permanently change the dpi of the figure, but due to the buggy code, it seems to be doing so.

The buggy code incorrectly handles the dpi value and temporarily changes it without resetting it to its original value. This leads to the assertion error in the test case, where `fig.dpi` is expected to be equal to the original dpi but is not.

To fix this bug, the function should save the original dpi value, update it during the calculation if necessary, and then restore the original dpi value before returning.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` method:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box. If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`. In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
    """
    if not self.get_visible():
        return Bbox.unit()

    original_dpi = self.figure.dpi

    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi

    if self.get_text() == '':
        tx, ty = self._get_xy_display()
        return Bbox.from_bounds(tx, ty, 0, 0)

    if renderer is not None:
        self._renderer = renderer

    if self._renderer is None:
        self._renderer = self.figure._cachedRenderer

    if self._renderer is None:
        raise RuntimeError('Cannot get window extent w/o renderer')

    bbox, info, descent = self._get_layout(self._renderer)
    x, y = self.get_unitless_position()
    x, y = self.get_transform().transform((x, y))
    bbox = bbox.translated(x, y)

    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = original_dpi

    return bbox
```

In the corrected code, `original_dpi` is saved before potentially changing the dpi. After calculations are done, if the dpi value was changed, it is restored to its original value before returning the result.
