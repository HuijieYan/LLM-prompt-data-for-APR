The error message is indicating that the figure's dpi is being permanently changed, which is not the intended behavior. 

Upon review of the `get_window_extent` method, it seems that the bug may be related to the conditional block that temporarily changes the figure's dpi. 

The reason for the bug is that the method temporarily changes the figure's dpi to the provided dpi value, but there is no code to reset the dpi to its original value after the bounding box computation is done.

To fix the bug, we should store the original dpi value, change the dpi for bounding box computation, and then reset the dpi to its original value before returning the bbox.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` method:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    if not self.get_visible():
        return Bbox.unit()

    if dpi is not None:
        dpi_orig = self.figure.dpi
        self.figure.dpi = dpi

    if self.get_text() == '':
        tx, ty = self._get_xy_display()
        bbox = Bbox.from_bounds(tx, ty, 0, 0)
    else:
        if renderer is not None:
            self._renderer = renderer
        if self._renderer is None:
            self._renderer = self.figure._cachedRenderer
        if self._renderer is None:
            raise RuntimeError('Cannot get window extent w/o renderer')

        bbox, info, descent = self._get_layout(self._renderer)
        x, y = self.get_unitless_position()
        x, y = self.get_transform().transform((x, y))
        bbox = bbox.translated(x, y)

    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi_orig

    return bbox
``` 

In this corrected code, we have saved the original dpi as `dpi_orig`, changed the dpi for bbox computation, and reset the dpi to its original value if a new dpi was specified. This should address the bug identified by the error message.
