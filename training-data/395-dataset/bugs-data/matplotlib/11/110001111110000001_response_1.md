The test case tests the `get_window_extent` function of the `Text` class in Matplotlib. The `get_window_extent` function calculates the bounding box of the text, which should not permanently change the dpi according to the test.

The error occurs because the dpi setting of the figure is being permanently changed when the `get_window_extent` function is called with a non-default dpi value.

The bug is likely originating from the conditional block where the `dpi` is set and then restored. Due to an error in the logic, the original dpi value of the figure is not being correctly restored, causing it to permanently change.

To fix this bug, the code inside the `get_window_extent` function should be modified to correctly handle the restoration of the original dpi value. This can be achieved by storing the original dpi, adjusting it as required, and then resetting it back to its original value.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` function:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    if not self.get_visible():
        return Bbox.unit()

    orig_dpi = self.figure.dpi  # Store the original dpi value

    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi  # Set the new dpi if provided

    if self.get_text() == '':
        tx, ty = self._get_xy_display()
        bbox = Bbox.from_bounds(tx, ty, 0, 0)
    else:
        if renderer is not None:
            self._renderer = renderer
        if self._renderer is None:
            self._renderer = self.figure._cachedRenderer
        if self._renderer is None:
            raise RuntimeError('Cannot get window extent w/o renderer')

        bbox, info, descent = self._get_layout(self._renderer)
        x, y = self.get_unitless_position()
        x, y = self.get_transform().transform((x, y))
        bbox = bbox.translated(x, y)

    # Reset the original dpi value after calculation
    self.figure.dpi = orig_dpi

    return bbox
``` 

This corrected code ensures that the original dpi is correctly restored after the bounding box calculation in the `get_window_extent` function.
