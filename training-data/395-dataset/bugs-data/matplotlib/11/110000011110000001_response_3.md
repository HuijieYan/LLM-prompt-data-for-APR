The error occurs in the `test_non_default_dpi` function, specifically in the line `assert fig.dpi == dpi`. The assertion fails because the dpi value of the figure has been permanently changed by the `get_window_extent` method, which is not the expected behavior according to the comment in the buggy function. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `dpi` parameter. The function changes the dpi of the figure when the `dpi` parameter is not None and resets the dpi to its original value later in the function. However, in the test case, the assertion fails because the dpi value is permanently changed instead of being reset to its original value.

The bug occurs because the buggy function does not reset the figure's dpi to its original value when the execution of the `get_window_extent` method is complete.

To fix this bug, the `self.figure.dpi` should be saved in a variable before it is changed and then reset to its original value after its usage in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` method:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    # Save the original dpi value
    dpi_orig = self.figure.dpi
    """
    The rest of the function
    """
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi_orig  # Reset the figure's dpi to its original value
    return bbox
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct `bbox` while no longer permanently changing the dpi value of the figure.
