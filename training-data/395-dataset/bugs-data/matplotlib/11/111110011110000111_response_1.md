The error message is indicating that the `assert fig.dpi == dpi` is failing, with `fig.dpi` being 800.0 and `dpi` being 80.0.

The potential error location in the `get_window_extent` method is when the DPI is temporarily changed and then reverted. The temporary change in DPI is causing the `fig.dpi` to change permanently and not reverting back to its original value.

The bug occurs because the method temporarily changes the DPI when it is passed as an argument to `get_window_extent`, but it does not revert the DPI back to its original value after the function call. This results in a permanent change in the DPI of the figure.

To fix this bug, we need to store the original DPI of the figure, change the DPI temporarily if a new value is provided, and then revert the DPI back to its original value before returning the result.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` method:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
    """
    original_dpi = self.figure.dpi  # Store the original DPI
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi  # Change DPI temporarily if a new value is provided

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = original_dpi  # Revert the DPI back to its original value

    return bbox
```
