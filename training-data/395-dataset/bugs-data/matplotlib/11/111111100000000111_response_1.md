The potential error in the provided code is within the `get_window_extent` function. It seems that the function is trying to handle the `dpi` parameter but is not doing so correctly, leading to potential issues with the DPI value.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the `dpi` parameter. The code attempts to temporarily change the figure's DPI but does not restore the original DPI value if it was changed, potentially causing unintended side effects.

To fix the bug, the code should properly handle the DPI change and restoration, ensuring that the original DPI value is restored after the bounding box computation.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` function:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    if not self.get_visible():
        return Bbox.unit()
    
    original_dpi = self.figure.dpi

    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi

    if self.get_text() == '':
        tx, ty = self._get_xy_display()
        return Bbox.from_bounds(tx, ty, 0, 0)

    if renderer is not None:
        self._renderer = renderer
    if self._renderer is None:
        self._renderer = self.figure._cachedRenderer
    if self._renderer is None:
        raise RuntimeError('Cannot get window extent w/o renderer')

    bbox, info, descent = self._get_layout(self._renderer)
    x, y = self.get_unitless_position()
    x, y = self.get_transform().transform((x, y))
    bbox = bbox.translated(x, y)

    self.figure.dpi = original_dpi  # Restore the original DPI value
    return bbox
``` 

In the corrected code, the original DPI value is stored before potentially changing it and then restored after the bounding box computation, ensuring that the DPI value is handled correctly.
