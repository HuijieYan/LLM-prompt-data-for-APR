The potential error in the `get_window_extent` function is the manipulation of the `self.figure.dpi` value. The function is attempting to temporarily change the dpi value of the figure, but it doesn't reset it to the original value if `dpi` is not None.

To fix this bug, we should save the original `self.figure.dpi` value, and then reset it to its original value after using it if `dpi` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` function:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
    """
    original_dpi = self.figure.dpi  # save the original dpi value
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi  # temporarily change the dpi value

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = original_dpi  # reset the dpi value to its original value
    return bbox
```
