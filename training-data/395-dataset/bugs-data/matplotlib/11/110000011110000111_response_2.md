The test function tests the behavior of the `get_window_extent` method of the `Text` class for different DPI settings. It creates a text object, retrieves its bounding box at the default DPI, and then retrieves the bounding box at a custom DPI. Finally, it checks that the two bounding boxes are related by a scaling factor equal to the custom DPI.

The error occurs because the `get_window_extent` method does not correctly handle the DPI. The original function changes the figure's DPI when `dpi` is not None but fails to revert it to the original DPI after the calculations. This results in an incorrect comparison of the figure's DPI against the original DPI stored in the `dpi` variable.

To fix the bug, the function should store the original DPI of the figure, and revert to this DPI after performing the calculations. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    if not self.get_visible():
        return Bbox.unit()
    dpi_orig = self.figure.dpi  # Store the original DPI
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi
    if self.get_text() == '':
        tx, ty = self._get_xy_display()
        return Bbox.from_bounds(tx, ty, 0, 0)

    if renderer is not None:
        self._renderer = renderer
    if self._renderer is None:
        self._renderer = self.figure._cachedRenderer
    if self._renderer is None:
        raise RuntimeError('Cannot get window extent w/o renderer')

    bbox, info, descent = self._get_layout(self._renderer)
    x, y = self.get_unitless_position()
    x, y = self.get_transform().transform((x, y))
    bbox = bbox.translated(x, y)
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi_orig  # Revert to the original DPI
    return bbox
```
By storing the original DPI, the function ensures that it correctly reverts to the original DPI after performing the calculations, preventing the incorrect assertion in the test function.
