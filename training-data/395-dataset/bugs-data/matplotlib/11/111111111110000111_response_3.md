The error occurs when the test function tries to compare the figure's dpi value after calling the `get_window_extent` method with a non-default dpi value. The test expects that after calling `get_window_extent(dpi=dpi * 10)`, the figure's dpi value should remain unchanged, but it fails due to the buggy behavior of the `get_window_extent` method.

The buggy behavior in the `get_window_extent` method is that it sets the figure's dpi to a new value inside the function but does not reset it to the original value if `dpi` is provided. This causes the figure's dpi to change permanently when `get_window_extent` is called with a non-default dpi value.

To fix this, the `get_window_extent` method should store the original dpi value, set the figure's dpi to the new value if provided, perform the necessary calculations, and then reset the figure's dpi to its original value before returning the result.

Here's the corrected `get_window_extent` method:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    original_dpi = self.figure.dpi  # Store the original dpi value
    if dpi is not None:  # If dpi is provided, set figure's dpi to the new value
        self.figure.dpi = dpi
    # Perform calculations to get the bbox
    bbox = ...
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = original_dpi  # Reset figure's dpi to its original value
    return bbox
```
