The bug occurs in the `set_tick_params` method. This method sets appearance parameters for ticks, tick labels, and gridlines. However, in the 'L' mode for `ImageGrid`, the offset text on axes still appears for all axes, even though the tick labels themselves are not present. The "L" mode should disable the offset text where appropriate.

The bug occurs because the `set_tick_params` method does not account for the 'L' mode in `ImageGrid` and therefore does not disable the offset text where appropriate.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `set_tick_params` method to handle the 'L' mode in `ImageGrid` and disable the offset text where appropriate. This can be achieved by adding a conditional statement to check if the label_mode is 'L', and if so, disable the offset text.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_tick_params` method:

```python
def set_tick_params(self, which='major', reset=False, label_mode=None, **kw):
    """
    Set appearance parameters for ticks, ticklabels, and gridlines.

    For documentation of keyword arguments, see
    :meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick_params`.
    """
    cbook._check_in_list(['major', 'minor', 'both'], which=which)
    kwtrans = self._translate_tick_kw(kw)

    if label_mode == "L":
        kwtrans['labelleft'] = False
        kwtrans['labelbottom'] = False
        kwtrans['labeltop'] = False
        kwtrans['labelright'] = False

    # rest of the method...

    self.stale = True
```

By adding a conditional statement to handle the 'L' mode in the `ImageGrid`, we can now ensure that the offset text on axes is appropriately disabled when the tick labels are not present. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected outcome for the `ImageGrid` with the 'L' label mode.
