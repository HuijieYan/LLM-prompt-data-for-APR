The error message indicates that the `assert` statement `assert not ax.yaxis.get_offset_text().get_visible()` is failing, which means that the `get_visible` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` according to the expectation. This indicates a problem with the `get_visible` method of the `Text` object.

Looking into the buggy function, it seems that the issue might lie in how the `label2On` parameter is being handled. It appears that the `label2On` parameter controls the visibility of the offset text. However, when `label2On` is set to `False`, the offset text should also be set to invisible.

The issue could be due to the handling of the `label2On` parameter when setting tick parameters. It seems that the functionality related to setting the visibility of the offset text based on the `label2On` parameter is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `label2On` is set to `False`, the offset text should be set as not visible.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_tick_params(self, which='major', reset=False, **kw):
    # ... existing function code ...
    else:
        if which in ['major', 'both']:
            self._major_tick_kw.update(kwtrans)
            for tick in self.majorTicks:
                tick._apply_params(**kwtrans)
            if 'label2On' in kwtrans and not kwtrans['label2On']:
                self.offsetText.set_visible(False)
        if which in ['minor', 'both']:
            self._minor_tick_kw.update(kwtrans)
            for tick in self.minorTicks:
                tick._apply_params(**kwtrans)
            if 'label2On' in kwtrans and not kwtrans['label2On']:
                self.offsetText.set_visible(False)
```

By incorporating an additional condition to check if `label2On` is set to `False` and accordingly setting the offset text visibility to `False`, the issue should be resolved in the corrected function.
