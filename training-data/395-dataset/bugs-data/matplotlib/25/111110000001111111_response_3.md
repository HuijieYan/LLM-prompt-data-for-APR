The issue arises from the fact that the `positions` array is not being sorted when it is passed as a list, but it is sorted when passed as a numpy array. This behavior is inconsistent and may lead to unexpected results for users.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that sorts the `positions` array if it is not passed as a numpy array. This behavior is not explicitly stated in the documentation, and it should either be consistently applied to both list and numpy array inputs, or the sorting should be removed altogether for consistency.

To fix this issue, one approach is to remove the sorting of the `positions` array in the `EventCollection` class, and leave the responsibility of sorting to the user before calling the `eventplot` function. This change would make the behavior consistent for both list and numpy array inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `EventCollection` class:

```python
# class declaration with the corrected function
class EventCollection(LineCollection):
    """
    A collection of discrete events.
    
    The events are given by a 1-dimensional array, usually the position of
    something along an axis, such as time or length.  They do not have an
    amplitude and are displayed as vertical or horizontal parallel bars.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __init__ function for the EventCollection class
    def __init__(self,
                 positions,     # Cannot be None.
                 orientation=None,
                 lineoffset=0,
                 linelength=1,
                 linewidth=None,
                 color=None,
                 linestyle='solid',
                 antialiased=None,
                 **kwargs
                 ):
        """
        Parameters
        ----------
        positions : 1D array-like object
            Each value is an event.
    
        orientation : {None, 'horizontal', 'vertical'}, optional
            The orientation of the **collection** (the event bars are along
            the orthogonal direction). Defaults to 'horizontal' if not
            specified or None.
    
        lineoffset : scalar, optional, default: 0
            The offset of the center of the markers from the origin, in the
            direction orthogonal to *orientation*.
    
        linelength : scalar, optional, default: 1
            The total height of the marker (i.e. the marker stretches from
            ``lineoffset - linelength/2`` to ``lineoffset + linelength/2``).
    
        linewidth : scalar or None, optional, default: None
            If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.
    
        color : color, sequence of colors or None, optional, default: None
            If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.
    
        linestyle : str or tuple, optional, default: 'solid'
            Valid strings are ['solid', 'dashed', 'dashdot', 'dotted',
            '-', '--', '-.', ':']. Dash tuples should be of the form::
    
                (offset, onoffseq),
    
            where *onoffseq* is an even length tuple of on and off ink
            in points.
    
        antialiased : {None, 1, 2}, optional
            If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.
    
        **kwargs : optional
            Other keyword arguments are line collection properties.  See
            :class:`~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` for a list of
            the valid properties.

```

This corrected code removes the sorting of the `positions` array and provides consistency for both list and numpy array inputs. Users can now ensure that the `positions` array is sorted if required before calling the `eventplot` function.
