The test case `test_EventCollection_nosort` creates an array `arr` with values `[3, 2, 1, 10]` and then calls the `EventCollection` constructor with `arr` as the argument. It then checks if the original array `arr` is still the same, which is expected to be true. However, the test fails with an `AssertionError` indicating that the original array `arr` has been modified. 

The bug is likely to be in the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class, where the `positions` array is being sorted. This sorting modifies the original array, leading to the failure of the test.

The bug occurs because the `positions` array is being sorted in place without creating a copy of the input array. This affects the original array `arr`.

To fix this bug, it is important to modify the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class to sort a copy of the `positions` array instead of sorting it in place.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Rest of the code remains the same
    """

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    sorted_positions = np.sort(positions)  # Sorting a copy of the positions array
    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By sorting a copy of the `positions` array, the original input array will not be modified, and the test case `test_EventCollection_nosort` is expected to pass after this modification.
