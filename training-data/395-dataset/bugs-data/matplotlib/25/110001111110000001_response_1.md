The error in the provided test function is occurring because the `EventCollection` is modifying the input `positions` array in place, which results in mismatched elements in the test.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that sorts the `positions` array. This is where the input array `positions` is being modified in place, causing the test to fail.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `positions` array is being sorted in place, which modifies the original array and causes the `assert_array_equal` test to fail.

To fix the bug, we should avoid modifying the original `positions` array and instead create a sorted copy of it for further processing. This will ensure that the original input is not modified.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    ... (other comments)

    """
    # create a sorted copy of the positions array to avoid modifying the original input
    sorted_positions = np.sort(positions)

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2., lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    if len(sorted_positions) == 0:
        segments = []
    elif hasattr(sorted_positions, 'ndim') and sorted_positions.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than one dimension.')
    elif (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
          orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
        segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in sorted_positions]
        self._is_horizontal = True
    elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
        segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in sorted_positions]
        self._is_horizontal = False
    else:
        cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                             orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```
In the corrected code, we create a sorted copy of the `positions` array before further processing to ensure that the original input is not modified. This fix addresses the issue of modifying the input in place and should resolve the error in the test function.
