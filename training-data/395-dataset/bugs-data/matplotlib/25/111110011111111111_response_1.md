The error occurs because the input array `arr` should not be modified by the `EventCollection` class, but it is modified in-place by sorting it. This indicates that the bug is located in the sorting logic inside the `EventCollection` class.

The reason behind this bug is that when the `positions` parameter is of type `ndarray`, the sorting logic is applied to it directly, modifying the original array. However, when `positions` is of type `list`, the sorting logic is not applied, hence leaving the original list untouched.

To fix this bug, the `positions` parameter should be sorted only when it is of type `numpy.ndarray`, and no sorting should be performed if it is of type `list`. This can be achieved by using the `isinstance()` function to check the type of `positions` before applying sorting.

Here's the corrected code for the `EventCollection` class:

```python
class EventCollection(LineCollection):
    # ... (omitted code)

    def __init__(self, positions, orientation=None, lineoffset=0, linelength=1, linewidth=None, color=None, linestyle='solid', antialiased=None, **kwargs):
        # ... (omitted code) ...

        if isinstance(positions, np.ndarray):
            positions = np.sort(positions)
            
        # ... (omitted code) ...
```

By making this change, the `positions` array will only be sorted if it is an instance of `numpy.ndarray`, and the bug causing the incorrect sorting in the test case will be fixed.
