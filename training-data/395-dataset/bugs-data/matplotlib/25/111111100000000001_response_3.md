Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `__init__` function of the `EventCollection` class. There is a conditional statement that checks if `positions` is None or has a length of 0, but the condition is written incorrectly.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to check if `positions` is None or empty is not written correctly. Additionally, there is a comparison with `orientation` using `lower()` method, but the value of `orientation` might be `None` which would result in an AttributeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition to properly check if `positions` is None or empty.
2. Check if `orientation` is None before attempting to convert it to lowercase.

Corrected Code:

```python

             positions,     # Cannot be None.
