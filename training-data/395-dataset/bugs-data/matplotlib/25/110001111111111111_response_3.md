The issue arises from the incorrect sorting of the input positions when it is an array, while it remains unsorted when passed as a list. This inconsistency leads to a failure in the test case as it expects unsorted positions.

The bug is caused by the `positions.sort()` line inside the `__init__` method. The initial array `positions` is being sorted in-place, affecting the original input.

To fix the bug, the sorting operation should be performed on a copy of the input positions rather than modifying the original input. This will ensure that the original input array is preserved.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class:

```python
# Corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Rest of the method remains the same
    """
    # Create a sorted copy of the positions array
    sorted_positions = np.sort(positions)

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2., lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    
    # Rest of the method remains the same
```

By creating a sorted copy of the input positions using `np.sort()`, the original input is preserved, and the issue of inconsistency with array and list inputs is addressed.
