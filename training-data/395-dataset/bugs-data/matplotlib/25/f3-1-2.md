Bug report
Bug summary

When using eventplot, the data is sorted in-place if it's passed as a numpy array. If the data is passed as a list, this doesn't happen.

Code for reproduction

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# This sorts the data
sample_data = np.array([3, 2, 1, 10])
plt.eventplot(sample_data)
print(sample_data)

# This does not sort the data
sample_data = [3, 2, 1, 10]
plt.eventplot(sample_data)
print(sample_data)
Actual outcome

[ 1  2  3 10]
[3, 2, 1, 10]

Expected outcome
For consistency, it would be good if the outcome was always sorted, or always untouched. My preference would be that the data remains unsorted.
