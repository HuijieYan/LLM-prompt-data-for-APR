The bug in the provided function is that when the input positions are passed as a numpy array, they are automatically sorted, but if they are passed as a list, they are not sorted.

The issue occurs because in the buggy code, when the positions are sorted, it is done only for numpy arrays and not for lists.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `__init__` function to sort the positions irrespective of the input type (numpy array or list). This will ensure that the positions are always sorted before processing.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function which ensures that the positions are always sorted before further processing:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : 1D array-like object
        Each value is an event.

    orientation : {None, 'horizontal', 'vertical'}, optional
        The orientation of the **collection** (the event bars are along
        the orthogonal direction). Defaults to 'horizontal' if not
        specified or None.

    lineoffset : scalar, optional, default: 0
        The offset of the center of the markers from the origin, in the
        direction orthogonal to *orientation*.

    linelength : scalar, optional, default: 1
        The total height of the marker (i.e. the marker stretches from
        ``lineoffset - linelength/2`` to ``lineoffset + linelength/2``).

    linewidth : scalar or None, optional, default: None
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    color : color, sequence of colors or None, optional, default: None
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    linestyle : str or tuple, optional, default: 'solid'
        Valid strings are ['solid', 'dashed', 'dashdot', 'dotted',
        '-', '--', '-.', ':']. Dash tuples should be of the form::

            (offset, onoffseq),

        where *onoffseq* is an even length tuple of on and off ink
        in points.

    antialiased : {None, 1, 2}, optional
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    **kwargs : optional
        Other keyword arguments are line collection properties.  See
        :class:`~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` for a list of
        the valid properties.

    Examples
    --------

    .. plot:: gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/eventcollection_demo.py
    """

    # Ensure positions are always sorted
    positions = sorted(positions)

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)

    if positions is None or len(positions) == 0:
        segments = []
    # rest of the code remains the same
```

By sorting the positions at the beginning of the `__init__` function, we ensure that the bug is fixed and the positions are always sorted before being further processed. This resolves the inconsistency in behavior between numpy arrays and lists.
