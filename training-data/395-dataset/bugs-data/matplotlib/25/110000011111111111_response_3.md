The problem occurs because the `positions` array is being sorted in-place, leading to unexpected behavior when the original array is compared with the modified one. This sorting behavior differs when the input is a list compared to a numpy array, leading to inconsistencies.

To fix this issue, the sorting of the `positions` array should be done in a way that does not modify the original input array. This can be achieved by creating a sorted copy of the `positions` array before performing any operations on it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    (same as in the original function)
    """

    positions_copy = np.array(positions)  # Create a sorted copy of positions
    positions_copy.sort()  # Sort the copy of positions

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    if positions_copy.size == 0:
        segments = []
    elif hasattr(positions_copy, 'ndim') and positions_copy.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than '
                         'one dimension.')
    elif (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
          orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
        segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in positions_copy]
        self._is_horizontal = True
    elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
        segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in positions_copy]
        self._is_horizontal = False
    else:
        cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                             orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```

By creating a sorted copy of the `positions` array and then sorting that copy, the original input array is left unchanged. This ensures consistency in behavior for both numpy arrays and lists as input, addressing the reported issue.
