The test function `test_EventCollection_nosort()` creates an EventCollection from an array and then checks if the input array has been modified in place. The array `arr` initially has the values `[3, 2, 1, 10]`, and the expected outcome is that the array should remain unchanged. However, the actual outcome shows that the array has been modified and sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 10]`.

The bug is occurring in the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class, where the `positions` parameter is being sorted in place if it is an array. When `positions` is a list, it is not being sorted, which causes the inconsistency in behavior observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, check the type of the `positions` parameter. If it is an array, create a copy of it before sorting to prevent modifying the original input in place. If it is a list, there is no need to sort it.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method for the `EventCollection` class:

```python
# Corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    ...
    """

    # Make a copy of positions if it is an array to avoid sorting it in place
    if isinstance(positions, np.ndarray):
        positions = positions.copy()

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    
    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    ...
```

This fix ensures that the `positions` parameter is not modified in place when it is an array, leading to consistent behavior regardless of whether `positions` is passed as a list or an array.
