The potential error in the provided function is that it is intended to be a class constructor (__init__) but it's missing the class declaration. It seems like this is a part of a larger class, and the __init__ method is only a part of it.

The bug occurred because the provided code is incomplete and does not contain the entire class definition.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to identify the class to which this __init__ method belongs and add the class declaration.
2. Ensure that all the necessary imports are included as well.

Here's the corrected code assuming this __init__ function belongs to a class named EventCollection:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.collections as mcoll

class EventCollection(mcoll.LineCollection):
    def __init__(self,
                 positions,     # Cannot be None.
                 orientation=None,
                 lineoffset=0,
                 linelength=1,
                 linewidth=None,
                 color=None,
                 linestyle='solid',
                 antialiased=None,
                 **kwargs
                 ):
        """
        Parameters
        ----------

        """

                   lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
        if positions is None or len(positions) == 0:
            segments = []
        elif hasattr(positions, 'ndim') and positions.ndim > 1:
            raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than '
                             'one dimension.')

                        coord1 in positions]
