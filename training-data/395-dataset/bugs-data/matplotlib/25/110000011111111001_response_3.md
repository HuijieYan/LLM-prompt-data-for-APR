The error originates from the discrepancy between the expected and actual output of the `test_EventCollection_nosort` test function. The test function checks whether the `EventCollection` function modifies the input array in place. The function is expected not to modify the input array, but it is currently failing to meet this expectation.

The potential error location within the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class is the sorting of the `positions` array within the method. This sorting is causing the input array to be modified in place, which conflicts with the test's expected behavior.

The bug occurs because the `positions` array is being sorted in place within the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class. This violates the requirement of the test case, which expects the `EventCollection` function not to modify the input array in place.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to create a copy of the `positions` array and sort the copy instead of the original array. This would prevent the input array from being modified in place.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class:

```python
class EventCollection:
    def __init__(self,
                 positions,     # Cannot be None.
                 orientation=None,
                 lineoffset=0,
                 linelength=1,
                 linewidth=None,
                 color=None,
                 linestyle='solid',
                 antialiased=None,
                 **kwargs
                 ):

        # Make a copy of the positions array to avoid modifying the input in place
        positions_sorted = np.array(positions)
        positions_sorted.sort()

        segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
                   lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
        if positions_sorted is None or len(positions_sorted) == 0:
            segments = []
        elif hasattr(positions_sorted, 'ndim') and positions_sorted.ndim > 1:
            raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than '
                             'one dimension.')
        elif (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
              orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
            segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for
                        coord1 in positions_sorted]
            self._is_horizontal = True
        elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
            segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for
                        coord1 in positions_sorted]
            self._is_horizontal = False
        else:
            cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                                 orientation=orientation)

        LineCollection.__init__(self,
                                segments,
                                linewidths=linewidth,
                                colors=color,
                                antialiaseds=antialiased,
                                linestyles=linestyle,
                                **kwargs)

        self._linelength = linelength
        self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```
With this correction, the `positions` array is sorted in a copy, and the original input array remains unaltered.
