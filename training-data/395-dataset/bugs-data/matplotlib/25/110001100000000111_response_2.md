The issue reported on GitHub is regarding the behavior of the `eventplot` function when passing a numpy array versus a list of positions. When using a numpy array, the data is sorted in-place, but when using a list, it is not sorted.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements that check for the orientation of the event plot and sort the positions accordingly. The issue seems to be that the positions are sorted in-place, leading to discrepancies in behavior when using numpy arrays versus lists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function sorts the positions array in-place, leading to unintended side effects when the user passes a numpy array.

To fix the bug, the function should create a copy of the positions array and then sort the copy, rather than sorting the original array in-place. This will ensure that the behavior is consistent regardless of whether a numpy array or a list is passed as the positions.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    # ... omitted code ...

    sorted_positions = sorted(positions)  # Create a sorted copy of positions

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    if sorted_positions is None or len(sorted_positions) == 0:
        segments = []
    elif hasattr(sorted_positions, 'ndim') and sorted_positions.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than '
                         'one dimension.')
    elif (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
          orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
        segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in sorted_positions]
        self._is_horizontal = True
    elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
        segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in sorted_positions]
        self._is_horizontal = False
    else:
        cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                             orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```
