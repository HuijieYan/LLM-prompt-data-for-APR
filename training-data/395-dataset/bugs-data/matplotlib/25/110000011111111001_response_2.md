The given test case "test_EventCollection_nosort" aims to verify that the "EventCollection" function does not modify the input array in place. This is confirmed by creating an array, passing it to the "EventCollection" function, and then using the "assert_array_equal" function to compare the modified array with the original one.

The error message indicates that the arrays are not equal. The function modifies the input array in place, which contradicts the intended behavior and causes the test to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the part where the "positions" array is sorted using "positions.sort()".

The bug occurs because the "positions" array is sorted in place within the function. This modification affects the original array passed to the function, leading to the failure of the test case.

To fix this bug, the "positions" array should be sorted without modifying the original array. This can be achieved by creating a copy of the "positions" array, sorting the copy, and using the sorted copy for further processing. Additionally, the segments should be created based on the original unsorted "positions" array to align with the intended behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Same documentation as before.
    """

    positions_sorted = np.sort(positions)
    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    if positions_sorted is None or len(positions_sorted) == 0:
        segments = []
    elif hasattr(positions_sorted, 'ndim') and positions_sorted.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than '
                         'one dimension.')

          orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):

                             orientation=orientation)
