The error message "ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)" indicates that there is an issue with array shapes while trying to broadcast them. This is likely due to the handling of arrays in the makeMappingArray function, particularly in the calculation of xind and lut.

The problematic part of the code is likely in the gamma transformation and the subsequent array operations. The gamma transformation seems to lead to incorrect shapes in xind, which causes issues when trying to broadcast arrays later on.

To fix this bug, the gamma transformation and subsequent array operations should be reviewed. It may be necessary to reshape or modify the arrays to ensure they have the correct shapes at each step of the process.

Here's the corrected makeMappingArray function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # begin generation of lookup table
    xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)

```

This corrected function modifies the operations on arrays to ensure that the shapes are consistently maintained throughout the process, which should prevent array broadcasting errors.
