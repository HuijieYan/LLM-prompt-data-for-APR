The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the xind variable, which is determined using np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma. This issue may cause incorrect mappings and errors in the lookup table generation.

To fix this bug, xind should be calculated directly from the N parameter without involving the gamma variable. This will ensure that the correct mappings are calculated based on the provided N value.

Here's the corrected code for the makeMappingArray function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    """Create an *N* -element 1-d lookup table

    *data* represented by a list of x,y0,y1 mapping correspondences.
    Each element in this list represents how a value between 0 and 1
    (inclusive) represented by x is mapped to a corresponding value
    between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The two values of y are to allow
    for discontinuous mapping functions (say as might be found in a
    sawtooth) where y0 represents the value of y for values of x
    <= to that given, and y1 is the value to be used for x > than
    that given). The list must start with x=0, end with x=1, and
    all values of x must be in increasing order. Values between
    the given mapping points are determined by simple linear interpolation.

    Alternatively, data can be a function mapping values between 0 - 1
    to 0 - 1.

    The function returns an array "result" where ``result[x*(N-1)]``
    gives the closest value for values of x between 0 and 1.
    """

    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N)
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    ind = np.round(x * (N - 1)).astype(int)

    distance = (x[1:] - x[:-1]) / (N - 1)
    lut = np.zeros(N)
    for i in range(len(ind) - 1):
        lut[ind[i]:ind[i + 1]] = np.linspace(y0[i], y1[i], ind[i + 1] - ind[i])
    lut[-1] = y0[-1]

    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
In this corrected code, the xind is calculated using the np.linspace(0, 1, N) method directly without involving the gamma variable. Additionally, the interpolation of intermediate values in the lut array is achieved using a loop that iterates over the calculated indices. This approach ensures that the lookup table is correctly generated based on the provided data and parameters.
