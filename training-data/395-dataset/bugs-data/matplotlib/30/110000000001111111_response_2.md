The problem occurs in the function `makeMappingArray` which is used to create a lookup table. The function was originally designed to handle the input parameter `N` when it is greater than 1. However, when `N` is equal to 1, it causes an error due to the handling of the `xind` variable and the subsequent calculations using `xind`. 

The error occurs because when `N` is equal to 1, the length of `xind` becomes 1 as well. Therefore, the calculations involving `xind` may result in unexpected behaviors or errors, leading to incorrect output and confusing error messages.

To fix this issue, we can introduce a conditional statement to handle the special case when `N` is equal to 1. In this case, the function can directly return the lookup table `lut` without performing the calculations involving `xind`.

Here's the corrected function with the added conditional statement to handle the case when `N` is equal to 1:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    if N == 1:  # Handle the special case when N is equal to 1
        lut = np.array([data[0][2]])
        return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
``` 

With this fix, the function now correctly handles the special case when `N` is equal to 1. It directly returns the lookup table without performing unnecessary calculations that could lead to errors.
