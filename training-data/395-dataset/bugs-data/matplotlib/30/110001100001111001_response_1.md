The bug seems to be caused by the calculation of the variable `ind` and corresponding `distance` depending on the `N` value. When `N` is less than the number of elements in `x`, it results in an empty `ind` and `distance` arrays, as observed in Buggy case 2 and Expected case 3. This happens because the approach of using `ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]` is no longer valid when `N` is less than the number of elements in `x`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way `ind` and `distance` are calculated based on the value of `N`. One way to do this is to calculate `ind` and `distance` based on the ratio of the indices and values in the `x` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # Calculate ind and distance based on N
    if N > 1:
        ind = (N-1) * (x - x[0]) / (x[-1] - x[0])
        ind = ind.astype(int)
        distance = (x[1:] - x[:-1]) * (N-1) / (x[-1] - x[0])
    else:
        # Handle N=1 case separately
        ind = np.array([], dtype=int)
        distance = np.array([], dtype=float)

    # begin generation of lookup table
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])

    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
