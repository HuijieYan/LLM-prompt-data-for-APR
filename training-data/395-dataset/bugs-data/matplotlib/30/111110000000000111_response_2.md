Potential error location: The error message in the GitHub issue suggests that the problem occurs within the method `colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list()`. The error message indicates that there is a problem with broadcasting the input array from shape (2) into shape (1).

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the method `colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list()` is expecting a single value for `N`, which indicates the number of elements in the colormap. However, when `N` is set to 1, it causes an error because the code is not handling this special case properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `makeMappingArray` function to handle the case where `N` is 1. This special case should be explicitly checked and handled to prevent the error from occurring. Additionally, any assumptions about the `N` value should be revisited to ensure that the function behaves correctly for all possible values of `N`.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # handling special case when N is 1
    if N == 1:
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, 2) ** gamma
        lut = np.interp(xind, x, y0, y1)
        return lut

    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

In this corrected code, a special case for handling `N` equal to 1 is added, which uses `np.interp` to handle the linear interpolation when `N` is 1. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
