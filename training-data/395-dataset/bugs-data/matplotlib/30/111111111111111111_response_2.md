The error message indicates that the function `makeMappingArray` is not returning the expected output for the given test cases. Additionally, the error message is related to the comparison of the expected output with the actual output of the function.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function is its return statements. The function must return a 1-dimensional array that represents the closest values for each element between 0 and 1, as indicated by the comments in the function.

The bug occurs because the function is not returning the expected array for the given input parameters. This could be due to a miscalculation or incorrect handling of the input data and parameters within the function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic for generating the `lut` (lookup table) array in the `makeMappingArray` function. This involves verifying the calculations and conditions for building the array, as well as ensuring that it correctly represents the mapping between input values and the corresponding output values.

Another approach is to add extra debugging statements or logging to trace the values of variables and arrays at different stages within the function, particularly before the return statement. This can help identify any discrepancies or errors in the calculated values compared to the expected values.

Below is the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut
    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `lut` array is generated according to the specified mapping and conditions, and it returns the expected 1-dimensional array for the given input parameters.
