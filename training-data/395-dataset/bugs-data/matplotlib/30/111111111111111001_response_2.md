The test case is using the `assert_array_almost_equal` function to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `makeMappingArray` function. The test case is failing with the error indicating that the arrays are not almost equal to 6 decimals. Additionally, it mentions a shape mismatch between the arrays.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function is the calculation of the xind and lut arrays when `callable(data)` is True. There might be an issue in the array generation logic or the way the function is applied to the xind array.

The bug occurs because when N is equal to 1, the `xind` array becomes a single value and the result in the `lut` array is also a single value. This causes a shape mismatch when compared to the expected result.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the edge case when N is equal to 1 separately. In this case, the result should still be an array with a single element and the `xind` array should also be a single value.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if N == 1:
        # Handle edge case when N is 1
        xind = np.array([0])
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(0), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut
    else:
        if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
            raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
        if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
            raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

        # begin generation of lookup table
        x = x * (N - 1)
        xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

        distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
        lut = np.concatenate([
            [y1[0]],
            distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
            [y0[-1]],
        ])
        # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
        return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
In this corrected code, the edge case for N equal to 1 is handled separately, ensuring the resulting array has the correct shape and values.
