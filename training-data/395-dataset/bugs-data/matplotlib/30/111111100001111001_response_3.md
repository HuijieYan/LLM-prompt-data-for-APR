Error: The function is returning unexpected values for the 'ind' and 'distance' variables. These variables are related to the calculation of the lookup table 'lut', which ultimately results in an incorrect output for certain input cases.

Reason: The bug is likely due to the calculation of 'ind' and 'distance' not being handled correctly, leading to unexpected results and memory error due to division by zero.

Approach:
1. The 'ind' variable is calculated using the numpy 'searchsorted' function, which might not work as expected.
2. Instead of using searchsorted, use a custom logic to calculate 'ind' and 'distance' to ensure that the correct indices and distance values are obtained.
3. Ensure that the division operation doesn't lead to division by zero and handle such scenarios.

Updated code:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # begin generation of lookup table
    ind = np.arange(N) * (x.size - 1) // (N - 1)
    distance = (np.arange(N) / (N - 1)) - (ind / (x.size - 1))
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])

    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
