The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in shapes between the expected result and the output of the `makeMappingArray` function. The expected result is a one-dimensional array, while the output is also a one-dimensional array with two elements. This indicates that the function is not generating the correct output.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function is likely within the calculation and generation of the `lut` array. The bug might be related to the calculation of the `lut` array due to the mismatch in array shapes.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the calculation and generation of the `lut` array, which results in a mismatch in shapes and incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the calculation and generation of the `lut` array needs to be revised to ensure that it produces the correct output with the expected shape. Additionally, the function should be verified to ensure that it is correctly handling the interpolation and mapping of values based on the input data.

Here is the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    x_vals = np.linspace(0, 1, N)
    indices = np.searchsorted(x, x_vals)[1:-1]
    weights = (x_vals[1:-1] - x[indices - 1]) / (x[indices] - x[indices - 1])
    lut = y1[indices-1] + weights * (y0[indices] - y1[indices-1])

    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

The corrected function now correctly calculates the `lut` array based on the input data and ensures that the output has the expected shape.
