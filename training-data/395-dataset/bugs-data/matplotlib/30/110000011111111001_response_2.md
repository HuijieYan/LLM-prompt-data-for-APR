The error occurs because the function `makeMappingArray` does not return the correct output for the input parameters provided in the test cases. The issue appears to be related to the interpolation and mapping logic within the function.

The potential error location is in the calculation of the lookup table `lut` and the variable `ind`.

The bug occurs because the implementation does not properly handle the edge case where `N` is less than the number of available mapping points. This causes issues with the calculation of the lookup table `lut` and the interpolation indices `ind`. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `N` is equal to 1.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the edge cases of `N` being less than the number of mapping points and `N` being equal to 1. It should also ensure that the calculation of the lookup table and interpolation indices is performed correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    
    if N == 1:
        return np.array([y0[-1]])

    if N <= len(x): 
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N)
        yind = np.linspace(0, 1, len(x))
        lut = np.interp(xind, yind, y0)
        return lut

    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

This corrected code handles the edge cases where `N` is less than the number of mapping points and also addresses the case where `N` is equal to 1. These cases are handled by directly returning a single element from `y0` and using linear interpolation with the available mapping points respectively.
