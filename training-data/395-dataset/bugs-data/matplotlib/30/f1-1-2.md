# buggy function docstring

```text
Create an *N* -element 1-d lookup table

*data* represented by a list of x,y0,y1 mapping correspondences.
Each element in this list represents how a value between 0 and 1
(inclusive) represented by x is mapped to a corresponding value
between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The two values of y are to allow
for discontinuous mapping functions (say as might be found in a
sawtooth) where y0 represents the value of y for values of x
<= to that given, and y1 is the value to be used for x > than
that given). The list must start with x=0, end with x=1, and
all values of x must be in increasing order. Values between
the given mapping points are determined by simple linear interpolation.

Alternatively, data can be a function mapping values between 0 - 1
to 0 - 1.

The function returns an array "result" where ``result[x*(N-1)]``
gives the closest value for values of x between 0 and 1.
