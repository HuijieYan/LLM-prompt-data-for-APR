Based on the error message provided in the GitHub issue, the error occurs in the `_init` method of the `LinearSegmentedColormap` class in the `colors.py` file. The specific error message is "ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)", indicating that there is an issue with broadcasting input arrays.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function is likely in the portion of the code that deals with handling the `N` parameter when it is equal to 1. This might be related to how the function handles broadcasting arrays when `N` is equal to 1.

The bug occurs because when `N` is 1, the function is not handling the input arrays properly for the specific edge case of `N` being 1. This leads to an error related to broadcasting input arrays.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the edge case of `N` being equal to 1 separately, ensuring that input arrays are broadcasted correctly, and the error related to broadcasting input arrays should be resolved.

The corrected function with the potential fix is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    if N == 1:  # Handle edge case of N = 1 separately
        return np.array([y0[0]])
    else:
        x = x * (N - 1)
        xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

        distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
        lut = np.concatenate([
            [y1[0]],
            distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
            [y0[-1]],
        ])
        return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

In this corrected code, the edge case of N being equal to 1 is handled separately, and a single-element array is returned in this case. This should prevent the error related to broadcasting input arrays when N is 1.
