The error occurs because the function `makeMappingArray` does not produce the expected output for the test cases provided.

The potential error location within the function is when calculating the array `xind` and then using it to compute `ind` and `distance`.

The bug occurs due to incorrect index calculation and potential issues in computing the `ind` and `distance` arrays. These calculations are essential for interpolating the mapping function. Additionally, the function might not handle the case where `N` is less than the length of the given mapping data correctly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the index calculations for `xind`, `ind`, and `distance` are correct. Furthermore, the function should handle the case where `N` is less than the length of the given mapping data by adjusting the calculations accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # begin generation of lookup table
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, len(x)) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x * (N - 1), xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])

    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

This corrected code adjusts the index calculation for `xind`, `ind`, and `distance` to ensure the correct interpolation when generating the lookup table. Additionally, it now properly handles cases where `N` is less than the length of the given mapping data.
