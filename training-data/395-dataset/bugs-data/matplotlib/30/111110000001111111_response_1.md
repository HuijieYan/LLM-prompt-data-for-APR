The bug occurs in the function `makeMappingArray` at the line `x = x * (N - 1)` while trying to broadcast arrays of different shapes. This is because when N is set to 1, the resulting array x is of shape (1,). This causes issues with broadcasting during the calculations with arrays of different shapes.

To fix this issue, we can modify the calculation to use a scalar value when N is equal to 1. This will ensure that the dimensions of the arrays align properly during the broadcast operation.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    
    if N == 1:
        # Use scalar value when N is 1
        xind = np.array([0.0])
    else:
        xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma

    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

This modification ensures that the function can handle the edge case where N is set to 1 without causing any broadcasting errors.
