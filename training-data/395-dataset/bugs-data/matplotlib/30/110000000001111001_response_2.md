The bug in the `makeMappingArray` function is likely to be related to the calculation of the `xind` and `lut` arrays. The variable `N` determines the size of the `xind` and `lut` arrays, which is used to generate the lookup table. 

The error occurs because in some cases, the input variable `N` is too small, and as a result, `xind` and `lut` arrays have insufficient space to accommodate the mapped values. This leads to incorrect values or empty arrays for `ind` and `distance`, causing the incorrect output.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the input parameter `N` is large enough to cover the mapping range properly. Additionally, we should also consider handling edge cases where `N` is too small.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # begin generation of lookup table
    xind = (np.arange(N) / (N - 1)) ** gamma
    lut = np.interp(xind, x, y0, y1)
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

In the corrected code, the lookup table is generated using `np.interp` function, which performs linear interpolation to map the values correctly. It also ensures that the lookup table is confined to values between 0 and 1 by using `np.clip` function. This approach addresses the issue of small `N` values and provides accurate interpolation for the mapping data.
