The error message indicates a mismatch in array shapes when the `assert_array_almost_equal` function is called. This suggests that the `makeMappingArray` function is returning an array with the wrong shape when `N` is 1.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function is likely in the calculation of the lookup table (`lut`) when `N` is 1, as this is where the shape of the array would be determined.

The bug occurs because when `N` is 1, the calculation of the lookup table does not handle the edge case correctly, resulting in an incorrect shape for the array. The `makeMappingArray` function should be modified to handle the edge case of `N` being 1 and return the proper array shape.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the lookup table should be adjusted to handle the case when `N` is 1. In this case, the function should directly return the result array based on the input data, as the interpolation process is not required when `N` is 1.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if N == 1:
        # when N is 1, return the result array directly based on the input data
        return np.array(data[0][2])
    
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    
    # begin generation of lookup table
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

With this modification, the `makeMappingArray` function should properly handle the case when `N` is 1 and return the correct result array shape.
