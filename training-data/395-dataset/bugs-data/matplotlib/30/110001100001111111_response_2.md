The bug is occurring when the input parameter N is set to 1. The error message "ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)" indicates that there is an issue with broadcasting arrays, likely related to the indexing and manipulation of arrays based on the value of N.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that when N is 1, the function attempts to perform array operations that are incompatible with a single value for N. This results in the ValueError when attempting to broadcast the array into shape (1).

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the special case of N=1. In the case of N=1, the function should return an array with a single value as lut, and the other array operations within the function should be handled appropriately for this case.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.array(data(xind), dtype=float)
        return np.clip(lut, 0, 1)

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # handle the special case of N=1
    if N == 1:
        return np.array([y0[0]])

    # perform array operations for N > 1
    x = x * (N - 1) # update x for N > 1
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

With the above correction, the function should handle the special case of N=1 appropriately without causing any ValueError related to array broadcasting.
