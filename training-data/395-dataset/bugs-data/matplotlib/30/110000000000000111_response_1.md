The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `linearSegmentedColormap.from_list` function, where the function is trying to create a linear segmented colormap with only one color. 

The bug occurred because the `LinearSegmentedColormap` is not designed to handle N=1 (as per the user's issue report), and it throws a confusing error message because it cannot broadcast the input array from shape (2) into shape (1).

To fix the bug, the error message handling in the `LinearSegmentedColormap` class could be improved to provide a more informative error message when N=1 is used, or the code could be updated to handle the case of N=1 by allowing for a single color to be specified without raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    """Create an *N* -element 1-d lookup table

    *data* represented by a list of x,y0,y1 mapping correspondences.
    Each element in this list represents how a value between 0 and 1
    (inclusive) represented by x is mapped to a corresponding value
    between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The two values of y are to allow
    for discontinuous mapping functions (say as might be found in a
    sawtooth) where y0 represents the value of y for values of x
    <= to that given, and y1 is the value to be used for x > than
    that given). The list must start with x=0, end with x=1, and
    all values of x must be in increasing order. Values between
    the given mapping points are determined by simple linear interpolation.

    Alternatively, data can be a function mapping values between 0 - 1
    to 0 - 1.

    The function returns an array "result" where ``result[x*(N-1)]``
    gives the closest value for values of x between 0 and 1.

        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma

        return lut

    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
