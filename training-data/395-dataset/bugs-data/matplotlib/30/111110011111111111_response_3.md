The error message "ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)" suggests that there is an issue with array broadcasting within the makeMappingArray function. This error occurs when the input parameter N is set to 1.

The problem is likely in the calculation of the variable x in the function. When N is 1, the array x should have a single element with a value of 0, as there is only one element in the output array. However, the current implementation of the function does not handle this case correctly, leading to the error message.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic for the x variable calculation when N is 1. We should ensure that x has a single element with a value of 0. Additionally, we should handle the case of N being 1 separately to avoid any array broadcasting issues.

Here's the corrected code for the makeMappingArray function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut
    
    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")
    
    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]
    
    if N == 1:
        # Handle the special case when N is 1
        lut = np.array([y1[0]])
        return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # begin generation of lookup table
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

With this correction, the makeMappingArray function will handle the special case when N is 1, allowing the test function to pass without the array broadcasting issue.
