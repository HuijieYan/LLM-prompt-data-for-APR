The bug occurs in the `makeMappingArray` function, particularly in the section where the `ValueError` "could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)" is raised.

The potential error location within the function is likely the attempt to create a LinearSegmentedColormap with N=1, which seems to result in an error due to an invalid input array shape.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when creating a LinearSegmentedColormap with `N=1`, the function attempts to broadcast an input array of shape (2) into shape (1), which is invalid.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the case when `N=1` differently in a way that avoids attempting to broadcast an input array of shape (2) into shape (1). One approach could be to explicitly handle the case of `N=1` and possibly return a default colormap rather than attempting to create a LinearSegmentedColormap.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    
    if N == 1:
        # Handle the case for N=1 by returning a default colormap
        return np.array([[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]])

    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    # begin generation of lookup table
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
