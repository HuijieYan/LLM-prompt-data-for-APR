    Each element in this list represents how a value between 0 and 1
    (inclusive) represented by x is mapped to a corresponding value
    between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The two values of y are to allow
    for discontinuous mapping functions (say as might be found in a
    sawtooth) where y0 represents the value of y for values of x
    <= to that given, and y1 is the value to be used for x > than
    that given). The list must start with x=0, end with x=1, and
    all values of x must be in increasing order. Values between
    the given mapping points are determined by simple linear interpolation.

    Alternatively, data can be a function mapping values between 0 - 1
    to 0 - 1.

    The function returns an array "result" where ``result[x*(N-1)]``
    gives the closest value for values of x between 0 and 1.

Bug summary

LinearSegmentedColormap with N=1 gives confusing error message.

Code for reproduction

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import colors

plt.figure()
fig = plt.gcf()
ax = plt.gca()

x = np.arange(0,3,1)
y = np.arange(0,3,1)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = Y

cs = [(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)]
N = 1 # No error if this is changed to 2
cmapg = colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('a',cs,N)
ax.pcolormesh(X, Y, Z, cmap=cmapg)

fig.show()
Actual outcome

In Matplotlib 3.1rc1, error is

  File "/Users/abc/anaconda3/envs/python3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib-3.1.0rc1-py3.6-macosx-10.7-x86_64.egg/matplotlib/colors.py", line 663, in _init
    self.N, self._segmentdata['red'], self._gamma)

ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)
Expected outcome

I ran into this error because I was plotting a matrix with values of NaN or 1 and only needed to specify a single color (there is probably a better way to do this). This worked in Matplotlib 2.2.2 as desired but caused a confusing error message in Matplotlib 3.1rc1.

I expected this to either work as-is or for pcolormap throw an error indicating that the passed colormap is invalid.
