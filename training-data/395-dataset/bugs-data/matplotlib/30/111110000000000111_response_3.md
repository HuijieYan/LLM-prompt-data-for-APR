The provided buggy function is not directly related to the GitHub issue provided. The issue on GitHub is related to the LinearSegmentedColormap from the Matplotlib library, while the provided code is for a different purpose. Therefore, it is not applicable to analyze the test case and its relationship with the error message.

The potential error location within the problematic function is with the generation of the lookup table in the makeMappingArray function. The issue might be related to the use of the variable N, which is the input for the function, and its relationship with the generation of the lookup table.

The bug occurred because the generation of the lookup table using N=1 caused an error in the function, leading to a confusing error message.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the edge case where N=1 separately to avoid the error. This can be done by including a condition to return a specific result when N=1 is passed as an argument to the makeMappingArray function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if N == 1:
        return np.array(data(0), dtype=float)

    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

In the corrected code, the edge case for N=1 is handled separately, and when N=1 is passed as an argument, the function returns a specific result without going through the usual lookup table generation process.
