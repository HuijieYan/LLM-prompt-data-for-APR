The error occurs because the function `makeMappingArray` does not return the expected output for the given input parameters. The `assert_array_almost_equal` function is used to compare the expected result with the result from the `makeMappingArray` function, and the test fails because they do not match.

The potential error location is in the calculation and generation of the `lut` variable. In the given buggy code, the calculation of the lookup table (`lut`) is not taking into account the length of `N` properly. This results in mismatched array shapes, causing the test to fail.

The bug occurs because when the value of `N` is less than the length of data, the calculation of the indexed positions (`ind`) and the distances between the values are incorrect.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the calculation of the `ind` and `distance` arrays takes `N` into account. This can be done by modifying the calculation of these variables based on the value of `N`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    xind = np.arange(N) / (N - 1)
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

This corrected code includes the modification in the calculation of `xind`, `ind`, and `distance` based on the value of `N`, which fixes the bug.
