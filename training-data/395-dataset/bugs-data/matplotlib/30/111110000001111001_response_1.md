The bug in the function `makeMappingArray` is likely to be caused by the calculation of the `ind` array and the subsequent computation of the `distance` array. These arrays are used to perform linear interpolation for mapping values between 0 and 1.

The bug is occurring because the variable `N` is not being used consistently in the calculation of indices. This issue causes problems with array shapes and division by zero when `N` is less than or equal to 2.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified in the section where `ind` and `distance` are calculated. Additionally, it's important to consider the edge case when `N` is less than or equal to 2.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")

    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma

    if N == 1:
        ind = np.array([], dtype=int)
        distance = np.array([], dtype=float)
    else:
        ind = (N - 1) * x[np.searchsorted(x / (N - 1), np.linspace(0, 1, N)) - 1]
        distance = (xind - ind) / (N - 1)
    
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by computing `ind` and `distance` based on the value of `N` and includes an edge case for when `N` is equal to 1. It also removes the redundant variable assignment for `x` and `xind`.
