The issue mentioned is related to setting marker style to 'none' in the scatter plot using `ax.scatter()` and `markers.MarkerStyle()`. The user expects the markers to be hollow, but it seems that the fillstyle parameter is not being processed correctly.

Upon review of the provided buggy function, it seems that the issue may be related to how the edge color and fill color are handled when defining marker properties. The implementation in the `scatter` function may not be correctly processing the fillstyle parameter when creating custom marker styles.

To fix the bug, the `scatter` function needs to be modified to correctly process the fillstyle parameter when creating custom marker styles. This could involve updating the code to ensure that when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers are rendered as hollow.

Here's the corrected function for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
    """
    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=x, ydata=y, kwargs=kwargs)
    x = self.convert_xunits(x)
    y = self.convert_yunits(y)

    # ... (additional code remains unchanged)

    if c is not None:
        if marker is not None and not isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
            # Process markers with the 'none' fillstyle to be hollow
            if 'fillstyle' in kwargs and kwargs['fillstyle'] == 'none':
                edgecolors = 'face'  # Set edgecolor same as facecolor to render markers hollow

    # ... (remaining code and return statement remain unchanged)
    return collection
```

In this corrected function, a condition has been added to check if the 'fillstyle' parameter is set to 'none', in which case the `edgecolors` parameter is updated to 'face'. This change ensures that the markers are rendered as hollow when the 'fillstyle' is set to 'none'.

By making this adjustment in the `scatter` function, the markers should now render as hollow when using a custom marker style with the 'none' fillstyle setting.

This change should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
