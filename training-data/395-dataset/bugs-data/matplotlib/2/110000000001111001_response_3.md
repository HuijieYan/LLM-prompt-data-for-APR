The error is likely caused by the function scatter attempting to use string values in the input list 'c' as colors, which causes an error when being converted into an array of floats. This is likely due to incorrect data types being used in the code.

To fix this issue, we can ensure that the 'c' input is properly converted to an array of floats before being used in the function.

Here's the corrected function code:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    """
    
    # Existing code for input processing
    # ...
    
    if c is not None:
        c = np.array(c, dtype=float)  # Convert 'c' to an array of floats
    else:
        c = None

    x = self.convert_xunits(x)
    y = self.convert_yunits(y)
    # Remaining code of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, before using the input 'c', we explicitly convert it to an array of floats using `np.array(c, dtype=float)`. This ensures that 'c' is transformed into a valid array of floats for further processing in the function.
