The error might be occurring in the `scatter` function, specifically in the part where the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. The reason for this could be that the code is not correctly handling the `fillstyle` parameter, resulting in the markers not being hollow as expected.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `fillstyle` parameter is properly handled when creating the `MarkerStyle`. It seems that the `fillstyle='none'` is not being processed correctly in the `PathCollection` creation, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

The corrected code for the `scatter` function is as follows:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)
    """
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:
    
    self._process_unit_info(xdata=x, ydata=y, kwargs=kwargs)
    x = self.convert_xunits(x)
    y = self.convert_yunits(y)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    marker_obj = marker
    if isinstance(marker, str):
        marker_obj = markers.MarkerStyle(marker, fillstyle='none')  # Ensure fillstyle is set to 'none'

    path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
        marker_obj.get_transform())

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
            (path,), scales,  # other parameters remain unchanged
            edgecolors=edgecolors,
            linewidths=linewidths,
            offsets=offsets,
            transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
            alpha=alpha
            )
    collection.set_transform(mtransforms.IdentityTransform())
    collection.update(kwargs)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    return collection
```

In this corrected code, the `fillstyle='none'` is explicitly set when creating the `MarkerStyle` object, and this marker style object is used to create the `PathCollection` for the scatter plot. This should ensure that the markers are hollow as expected when the `scatter` function is called with a custom `MarkerStyle` specifying `fillstyle='none'.
