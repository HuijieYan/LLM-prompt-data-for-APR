The test case `test_scatter_unfilled` is checking whether the face colors of the scatter plot are empty. The assertion is failing with the error message: `assert (3, 4) == (0, 4)`. This means that the number of face colors is not matching the expected value.

Looking at the buggy function, the problematic area seems to be the handling of `edgecolors` and `facecolors` for the scatter plot. Specifically, the color handling for unfilled markers might be causing the issue.

The bug is likely occurring because the `edgecolors` are correctly being set to the input values `[0.1, 0.3, 0.5]`, but the `facecolors` are not being properly handled for unfilled markers.

To fix the bug, the handling of `facecolors` for unfilled markers needs to be addressed. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the number of face colors matches the number of data points.

Here's the corrected version of the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
                vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
                verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):

    # existing method code...

    # ... (existing code)

    if marker not in ['.', ',', 'x', '+', 'v', '^', '<', '>', 's', 'd', 'D', 'p', '*', 'h', 'H']:
        c, colors, _ = self._parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
                                                      get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)
    else:
        edgecolors = c  # Assign c to edgecolors for filled markers

    # existing method code...

    # ... (existing code)
```

By handling the `facecolors` based on whether the marker is an unfilled type, we can address the issue. This change ensures that the number of face colors aligns with the number of data points and the edge and face colors are handled correctly based on the marker type.
