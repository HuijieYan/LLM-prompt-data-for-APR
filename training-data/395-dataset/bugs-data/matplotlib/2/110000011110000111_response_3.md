The error message in the test case indicates that the assertion `coll.get_facecolors().shape == (0, 4)` fails, as the actual shape returned is (3, 4) instead of the expected (0, 4). This suggests that the facecolors are being set when they should not be, leading to the failure of the test case.

Looking at the provided function `scatter`, it seems that the issue arises in the processing of the marker style when `fillstyle='none'`. The created `MarkerStyle` object is intended to have hollow markers, but the function does not properly handle the case when the markers should be hollow.

The reason behind the bug is that when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `edgecolors` should be used to specify the color of the marker edges, while the `facecolors` should not be set because it should have no fill. However, the implementation of the `scatter` function does not properly handle the case when using a `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none`.

To fix the bug, the `scatter` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This involves setting the `facecolors` to `None` and using the `edgecolors` to specify the color of the marker edges.

The corrected code for the `scatter` function is as follows:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):

    # Existing code...

    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)

    if marker_obj.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        facecolors = 'none'  # No fill
        edgecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', None)  # Use facecolor as edgecolor
    else:
        facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', None)
        edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', None)

    # Remaining code...
```

In this corrected `scatter` function, when the `MarkerStyle` has `fillstyle` set to 'none', it properly sets the `facecolors` to 'none' (indicating no fill) and uses the `facecolor` as `edgecolors` to specify the color of the marker edges. This should address the issue and align with the expected behavior when using a `MarkerStyle` with `fillstyle='none`.
