The issue reported on GitHub states that the markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'. The user's code is attempting to create a scatter plot with hollow markers, but it's not working as expected.

The potential error in the provided function seems to be in the section where the marker style is processed. In the `scatter` method, when a custom `MarkerStyle` is provided, it should handle the markers as hollow if `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This behavior is not currently implemented correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the marking handling for hollow markers is not correctly implemented in the existing `scatter` method, which is causing the markers not to render as hollow.

To fix the bug, the `scatter` method needs to be modified to properly handle the custom `MarkerStyle` and ensure that markers with `fillstyle='none'` are rendered as hollow.

Here is the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):

    # ... (other existing code)

    # load default marker from rcParams
    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
        if 'fillstyle' in kwargs:
            fillstyle = kwargs['fillstyle']
            if fillstyle == 'none':
                marker_obj._fillstyle = 'none'
    else:
        marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)
        if 'fillstyle' in kwargs:
            fillstyle = kwargs['fillstyle']
            if fillstyle == 'none':
                marker_obj._fillstyle = 'none'

    # ... (rest of the existing code)
```

In the corrected code, we check if `fillstyle` is specified in the `kwargs` and if it's set to 'none'. If so, we update the `_fillstyle` attribute of the `marker_obj` to 'none', which will render the markers as hollow. 

This modification ensures that when a custom `MarkerStyle` is provided with `fillstyle='none'`, the scatter plot will correctly render the markers as hollow.
