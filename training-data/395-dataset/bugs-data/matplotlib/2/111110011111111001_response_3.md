The bug is likely located in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, which is not defined in the provided source code. Additionally, there are issues with the facecolors and expected values in the test function.

The error message indicates that the `coll.get_facecolors().shape` is `(3, 4)` instead of the expected `(0, 4)`. This suggests that the scatter plot is creating filled markers instead of the expected unfilled markers.

The expected behavior is to have unfilled markers with edge colors and linewidths. However, the bug causes the markers to be filled.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the markers are unfilled by setting the appropriate style. Additionally, the edge colors should be explicitly set to the values provided in the input parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    c, colors = self._parse_scatter_color_args(
        c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
        get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)

    # Set facecolors and edgecolors
    if marker is not None and marker.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        facecolors = None  # No facecolors when the marker is unfilled
    else:
        facecolors = colors
    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
        (path,), scales,
        facecolors=facecolors,
        edgecolors=edgecolors,  # Set edgecolors explicitly
        linewidths=linewidths,
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha
    )
    collection.set_transform(mtransforms.IdentityTransform())
    collection.update(kwargs)

    if colors is None:
        collection.set_array(c)
        collection.set_cmap(cmap)
        collection.set_norm(norm)
        collection._scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)

    # ... (remaining code)
    return collection
```

With these changes, the scatter function should correctly handle unfilled markers with the specified edge colors and linewidths, resolving the bug.
