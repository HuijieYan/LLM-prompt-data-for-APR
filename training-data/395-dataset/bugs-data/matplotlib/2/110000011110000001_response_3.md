The error message is indicating that the shape of the `facecolors` obtained from the `PathCollection` returned by `plt.scatter` is not as expected. The expected shape is (0, 4) but the actual shape is (3, 4).

The potential error location within the `scatter` method is likely related to the handling of the `facecolors`. The bug seems to be in the way the `facecolors` are being handled when `marker` is specified as having no fill (`fillstyle='none'`).

The bug appears to be due to the fact that when `marker=mmarkers.MarkerStyle('o', fillstyle='none')` is specified, the `facecolors` should be empty, but they are not being set to an empty array.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
- When `marker=mmarkers.MarkerStyle('o', fillstyle='none')` is specified, the `facecolors` should be set to an empty array to indicate that there are no facecolors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if marker is not None and marker.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        facecolors = np.empty((0, 4))
    else:
        facecolors = colors

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
        (path,), scales,
        facecolors=facecolors,
        edgecolors=edgecolors,
        linewidths=linewidths,
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha
    )
    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
    
    return collection
```
