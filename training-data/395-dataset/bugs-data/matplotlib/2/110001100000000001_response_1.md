The potential error in the given code is that the function `_parse_scatter_color_args` is being called with an additional argument `get_next_color_func` which is expected to be passed internally in the function and not provided by the caller.

The reason behind the bug is that the function `scatter` is providing the additional argument `get_next_color_func` when calling the function `_parse_scatter_color_args`, which is not expected by the `_parse_scatter_color_args`.

To fix this bug, the additional argument `get_next_color_func` should not be provided when calling the function `_parse_scatter_color_args`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_2/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_next_color():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass



# this is the corrected and fixed function
