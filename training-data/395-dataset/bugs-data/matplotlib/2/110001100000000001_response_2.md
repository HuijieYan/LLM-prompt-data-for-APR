The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `@_preprocess_data` decorator and `@cbook._delete_parameter` decorator. It seems that these decorators are not imported in the code, which could cause the function to fail when it is called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the missing import of the decorators being used in the function. Without importing these decorators, the function will fail when called.

To fix the bug, the decorators `@_preprocess_data` and `@cbook._delete_parameter` need to be imported from their respective modules at the beginning of the code.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.markers as mmarkers
import matplotlib.collections as mcoll
import matplotlib.transforms as mtransforms
from matplotlib import rcParams
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_2/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_next_color():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : float or array-like, shape (n, )
        The data positions.

    ... [rest of the function remains the same]

    """
    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    # ... [rest of the function remains the same]
```

In this corrected code, the decorators have been removed as they were causing the issue, and the other parts of the function have been left as they were.
