The test case `test_scatter_unfilled` is trying to create a scatter plot with unfilled markers and then check the properties of the scatter plot collection `coll`. It specifically checks for the facecolors, edgecolors, and linewidths of the markers in the scatter plot.

The error message indicates that the assert statement `assert coll.get_facecolors().shape == (0, 4)` failed because the actual shape is (3, 4) instead of the expected (0, 4). This means that the markers are filled when they should be unfilled, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the logic that handles the marker fillstyle. It seems that the provided fillstyle is not being correctly applied to the markers, resulting in them being filled instead of unfilled as intended.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling marker fillstyle and filling of markers needs to be corrected. This may involve ensuring that the marker style and fillstyle are correctly passed to the `scatter` function and properly applied when creating the markers for the scatter plot.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker, fillstyle=kwargs.pop('fillstyle', 'full'))

    path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
        marker_obj.get_path().get_transform())
    
    # ... (remaining code)
```

In this corrected code, the `fillstyle` from the `kwargs` is explicitly passed to the `MarkerStyle`. Additionally, the logic for applying the fillstyle to the markers is adjusted to ensure that the markers are correctly created as unfilled when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
