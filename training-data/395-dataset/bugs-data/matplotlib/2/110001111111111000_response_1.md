    # Remove the @cbook._delete_parameter decorator as it is not necessary

The main issue in the provided function is that the `_parse_scatter_color_args` and `get_next_color` functions are nested within the `scatter` function, causing issues in the test case and making it challenging to maintain and understand the logic. I've fixed this by removing the decorator `@cbook._delete_parameter` and moving the nested functions outside of the `scatter` function. This should resolve the issue and make the code more organized and readable.
