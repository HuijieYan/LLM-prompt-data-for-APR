The error occurs in the test case `test_scatter_unfilled` when asserting the shape of the facecolors of the scatter plot collection. The assertion fails because the `coll.get_facecolors().shape` is `(3, 4)` instead of the expected `(0, 4)`.

The issue seems to be in the `scatter` method's handling of the marker's fillstyle. The `fillstyle='none'` is not being processed correctly, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

To fix the bug, the `scatter` method should be modified to handle the fillstyle parameter correctly and ensure that the markers are indeed hollow when specified.

Here is the corrected `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
                vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
                verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
                **kwargs):
        # ... (existing code)

        # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:
        # ... (existing code)

        if marker is None:
            marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

        if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
            marker_obj = marker
        else:
            marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker, fillstyle='none')  # Set fillstyle here

        path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
            marker_obj.get_transform())
        
        # ... (existing code)

        return collection
```

In this corrected code, the `fillstyle` parameter is set directly when creating the `marker_obj`, ensuring that the markers will be hollow when the `scatter` method is called with `fillstyle='none'`. With this change, the markers should appear as hollow as intended.
