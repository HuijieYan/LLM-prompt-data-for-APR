The issue is likely in the `scatter` method. The test case `test_scatter_unfilled` is attempting to verify that the markers are hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'`. However, the assertion fails because the `get_facecolors().shape` is not equal to `(0, 4)` as expected.

The bug occurs because the `scatter` method does not properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` parameter when creating the marker style. This results in the markers not being hollow as intended.

To fix the bug, the `scatter` method should be corrected to properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` parameter by ensuring that it creates markers with a hollow style when specified.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (remaining comments and parameter descriptions remain the same)

    """
    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    # (existing code remains the same)

    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']
    
    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)
        marker_obj._fillstyle = 'none'  # Set the fillstyle to 'none' for hollow markers

    # (existing code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, when the `marker` parameter is not explicitly specified as a `MarkerStyle` object, the `fillstyle` attribute of the `marker_obj` is set to `'none'` to ensure that the markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is specified as `'none'`.
