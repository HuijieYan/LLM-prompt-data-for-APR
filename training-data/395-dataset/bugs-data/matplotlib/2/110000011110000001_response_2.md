The test case `test_scatter_unfilled` is checking the behavior of the scatter plot when using unfilled markers. The specific assertion that is failing is checking the shape of the facecolors, which is expected to be (0, 4), indicating that there should be no facecolors.

The potential error location within the `scatter` function is likely in the section that handles unfilled markers. Specifically, the code that sets the edgecolors and linewidths for unfilled markers may not be working as intended.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of unfilled markers, resulting in the incorrect shape of the facecolors and potentially other properties.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the code that is responsible for handling unfilled markers and ensure that the edgecolors and linewidths are properly set and that the facecolors have the correct shape (in this case, (0, 4)) when the markers are unfilled.

Here's the corrected version of the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        edgecolors = coll.get_edgecolors().tolist()

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return collection
```

In the corrected function, when the marker is not filled, the edgecolors are set to the edge colors of the collection, and the rest of the function remains unchanged. This should address the issue with unfilled markers and fix the failing assertion in the test case.
