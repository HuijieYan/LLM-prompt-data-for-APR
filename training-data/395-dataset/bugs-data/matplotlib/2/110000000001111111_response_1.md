The bug occurs in the `scatter` method of the `AxesSubplot` class in Matplotlib. The issue mentioned in the GitHub post might be related to this bug, as it seems that the user wants to create hollow markers by setting `fillstyle='none'` in `markers.MarkerStyle` but is not getting the expected behavior.

The potential error location is within the `scatter` method, specifically in the section where marker properties are being handled and transformed.

The bug occurs because the `fillstyle` parameter is not being processed correctly within the `scatter` method. The `MarkerStyle` object is not being properly configured to have a `fillstyle` of 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `MarkerStyle` object needs to be properly configured with `fillstyle='none'` and ensure that this configuration is used when plotting the scatter plot.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.markers import MarkerStyle
from matplotlib import markers
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.axes._subplots import AxesSubplot

def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            fillstyle=None, **kwargs):
    # Remaining code stays the same
    
    # Load default marker from rcParams
    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

    if isinstance(marker, MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        marker_obj = MarkerStyle(marker)

    if fillstyle is not None:
        marker_obj.set_fillstyle(fillstyle)  # Set fillstyle if provided

    path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
        marker_obj.get_transform())
    # Remaining code stays the same
```

In this corrected code, the `fillstyle` parameter is properly processed, and the `MarkerStyle` object is configured to have the given `fillstyle`. This should ensure that the scatter plot markers are hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This fix addresses both the issue in the bug and the user's concern mentioned in the GitHub issue.
