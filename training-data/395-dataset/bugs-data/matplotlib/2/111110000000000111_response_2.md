The function scatter() in the provided code has a bug related to the fillstyle of the markers. The user is trying to set markers hollow by using markers.MarkerStyle and setting fillstyle='none', but it doesn't work as expected.

The issue description mentions that the user is trying to set markers hollow by creating a custom markers.MarkerStyle and setting the fillstyle to 'none'. However, it seems that the fillstyle is not being processed correctly, leading to the markers not being hollow as expected.

Upon analysis, the bug in the scatter() function code seems to be related to the handling of fillstyle when creating the marker. It appears that the fillstyle parameter is not being taken into account when constructing the PathCollection for scatter plot markers.

To fix this bug, the code for constructing the marker path should be modified to correctly handle the fillstyle parameter and create the markers as hollow when fillstyle='none' is specified. This can be achieved by checking for the fillstyle parameter and setting the appropriate edgecolors based on the fillstyle value.

Below is the corrected code for the scatter() function with the fix for the fillstyle issue:

```python
# Corrected scatter function with fillstyle handling
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None, vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None,
            linewidths=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    """
    # ... (omitted code)

    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:
    # ... (omitted code)

    # load default marker from rcParams
    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)

    path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(marker_obj.get_transform())
    
    # Fix for handling fillstyle to create hollow markers
    if marker_obj.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        edgecolors = 'k'  # Set edge color to black for hollow markers
        linewidths = 1.5   # Adjust linewidth for better visibility

    offsets = np.ma.column_stack([x, y])

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
        (path,), scales,
        edgecolors=edgecolors,
        linewidths=linewidths,
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha
    )

    # ... (omitted code)

    self.add_collection(collection)
    self._request_autoscale_view()

    return collection
```

In the corrected code, I added a block to check for the fillstyle of the marker and set the edgecolor to black and adjust the linewidth if fillstyle='none' is specified, which creates hollow markers as intended by the user.

This fix should resolve the issue with markers not being hollow when using markers.MarkerStyle and setting fillstyle='none'.
