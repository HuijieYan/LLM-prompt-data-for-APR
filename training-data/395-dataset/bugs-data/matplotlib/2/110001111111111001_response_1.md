The error occurs because the assertion `coll.get_facecolors().shape == (0, 4)` is failing, indicating that the actual shape of `coll.get_facecolors()` is `(3, 4)` instead of the expected `(0, 4)`. This suggests that the marker face color is being set when it should not be for the specific test case.

Upon examining the code, it appears that the bug might be related to how the marker face colors are handled when using an unfilled marker (e.g., `mmarkers.MarkerStyle('o', fillstyle='none')`). The code lacks a check to skip setting the face color for unfilled markers, resulting in the unexpected assertion failure.

To fix this issue, a condition should be added to check if the marker is unfilled, and if so, the facecolors should not be set. This can be achieved by making modifications to the logic where the facecolors are determined.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    # split the scatter calls based on object type
    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle) and not marker.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        c, colors, edgecolors = \
            self._parse_scatter_color_args(
                c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
                get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)
    else:
        c, edgecolors = \
            self._parse_scatter_color_args(
                c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
                get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)
        colors = None

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

In this corrected code, a condition is added to check if the marker style is an instance of `mmarkers.MarkerStyle` and also ensures that the `fillstyle` is not set to `'none'`. If the condition is met, the face colors are determined based on the input `c`; otherwise, they are set to `None`.

By incorporating this logic, the bug related to setting the face color for unfilled markers should be resolved, and the test case should pass as expected.
