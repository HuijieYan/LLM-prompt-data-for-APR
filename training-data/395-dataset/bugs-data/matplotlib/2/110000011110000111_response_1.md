The error occurs when the test function `test_scatter_unfilled` checks for the `facecolors` of the scatter plot collection. It expects the shape of `facecolors` to be (0, 4), but it obtains (3, 4) instead. This indicates that the markers are not hollow as expected.

The potential error location in the `scatter` method is where the `facecolors` and `edgecolors` are being handled during the creation of the scatter plot collection.

The bug occurs because the `fillstyle='none'` attribute is not being properly processed, resulting in filled markers instead of hollow ones.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling `fillstyle='none'` needs to be updated in the `scatter` method, ensuring that when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the `facecolors` are not created, resulting in hollow markers.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... [rest of the docstring remains unchanged] ...
    """
    # [existing code...]

    # Determine if the marker is filled or hollow
    fillstyle = kwargs.get('fillstyle', None)

    if fillstyle == 'none':
        facecolors = 'None'
    else:
        c, colors, edgecolors = \
            self._parse_scatter_color_args(
                c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
                get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    # [existing code...]
```
In this corrected function, we've added a logic to check for the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', we set the `facecolors` to 'None', ensuring that hollow markers are created. Otherwise, the `facecolors` are processed as before.

After making these changes, the `scatter` method should now properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and create hollow markers when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread as well as resolve the failing test case.
