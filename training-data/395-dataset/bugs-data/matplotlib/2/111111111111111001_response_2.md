The issue occurs in the `scatter` function, specifically in the handling of the `fillstyle='none'` case. This results in the incorrect determination of facecolors, leading to an assertion error in the test case.

The problem stems from the conditional logic in the `scatter` function where the marker style `fillstyle='none'` is not handled correctly, leading to incorrect facecolors and size determination.

To address the issue, the conditional logic for the `fillstyle='none'` case needs to be modified to ensure that facecolors are not determined when the marker style is unfilled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `scatter` function:

```python
# Corrected scatter function
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (other parameters and docstring)

    """
    
    # ... (omitted code for the initial processing)

    if marker is not None and isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle) and not marker.get_fillstyle():
        edgecolors = matplotlib.rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']  # reset edge colors
        facecolors = 'none'  # set facecolors to none for unfilled markers
    else:
        c, colors, edgecolors = self._parse_scatter_color_args(
            c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
            get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)

    # ... (omitted code for the rest of the function)
```
In the corrected scatter function, a conditional check is added to handle the case where `fillstyle='none'`. If the marker style is not None, is a MarkerStyle object, and has an unfilled style, the edgecolors are reset to the default scatter edgecolors, and facecolors are set to 'none' for the unfilled markers.

By introducing this conditional check, the `scatter` function can now accurately handle the case of unfilled markers, ensuring that the facecolors are not incorrectly determined and the assertion error is avoided.
