The issue described in the GitHub bug report seems to be related to the fillstyle of markers not working as expected when using the `scatter` method with a custom `MarkerStyle` object.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it appears that the bug is located in the `scatter` method of the matplotlib library. The issue seems to be related to the processing of the `edgecolors` and the `fillstyle` of the markers.

The reason for this bug could be that the code does not handle the `fillstyle` parameter properly when a custom `MarkerStyle` object is passed to the `scatter` method. It seems that the `scatter` method does not correctly interpret the fillstyle when a custom `MarkerStyle` is provided.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the `scatter` method so that it correctly handles the `fillstyle` when a custom `MarkerStyle` is passed. Additionally, the method should ensure that the `edgecolors` parameter is set appropriately to make the markers hollow.

Here is the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    # existing code...

    # existing code...

    # After the processing of the customizable marker, set the edgecolors to 'none' to make the markers hollow
    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle) and marker.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        edgecolors = 'none'

    # existing code...

    # existing code...
```

With this modification, the `scatter` method will first check if the marker is a custom `MarkerStyle` and its fillstyle is set to 'none'. If so, the `edgecolors` will be set to 'none', making the markers hollow as intended.

By making this change, the issue described in the bug report should be resolved, and the markers should appear as hollow when using a custom `MarkerStyle` with the `scatter` method.
