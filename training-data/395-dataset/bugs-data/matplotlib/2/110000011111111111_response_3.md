The issue seems to be related to the fillstyle parameter not being processed correctly when using markers.MarkerStyle for scatter plots. This results in the markers not appearing as hollow as expected.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the problem lies in the scatter function where the fillstyle parameter is not being properly handled, leading to the markers not being hollow.

The reason behind this bug could be that the fillstyle parameter is not being considered in the marker object when creating the PathCollection for the scatter plot.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to add the functionality to handle the fillstyle parameter when creating the marker object. This can be done by modifying the scatter function to properly process the fillstyle and set the edgecolor accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the scatter function:

```python
# Corrected scatter function
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (other parameters and descriptions)

    if marker is not None:
        if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
            marker_obj = marker
        else:
            marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)

        if 'fillstyle' in kwargs:
            fillstyle = kwargs.pop('fillstyle')  # Get the fillstyle from kwargs
            marker_obj.set_fillstyle(fillstyle)
        
        path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
            marker_obj.get_transform())

        if not marker_obj.is_filled():
            edgecolors = 'face'
            if linewidths is None:
                linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
            elif np.iterable(linewidths):
                linewidths = [
                    lw if lw is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']
                    for lw in linewidths]
                
    # ... (remaining code)
```

In this corrected version of the function, the fillstyle parameter is extracted from the kwargs and then used to set the fillstyle for the marker object. This should ensure that the markers appear hollow as expected when using markers.MarkerStyle with the scatter function.

By making these changes, the issue related to the markers not appearing hollow should be resolved. This updated implementation will ensure that the fillstyle parameter is properly handled when creating the marker object for the scatter plot.
