The potential error within the problematic function is the use of the variable `get_next_color_func`, which is supposed to be passed as an argument to the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method. However, in the code provided, it is attempting to be accessed from `self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color`, which should not be accessed in this context.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is attempting to access a method from a different part of the code instead of passing it as an argument.

To fix the bug, we should modify the signature of the `scatter` method to accept the `get_next_color_func` as an argument, and then use it properly when calling `_parse_scatter_color_args`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (other parameter descriptions remain the same)

    """
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    c, colors, edgecolors = \
        self._parse_scatter_color_args(
            c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size, get_next_color_func)

    # ... (other code remains the same)

```

By passing `get_next_color_func` as an argument to the `scatter` method and using it properly when calling `_parse_scatter_color_args`, we can fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
