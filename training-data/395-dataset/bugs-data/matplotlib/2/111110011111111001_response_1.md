The test case `test_scatter_unfilled` is checking the `scatter` function with an unfilled marker style and customized `c` (color) and `linewidths` parameters. The test asserts that the face colors of the collection returned by the `scatter` function should have a shape of `(0, 4)` because the marker style is unfilled.

The error occurs because the `scatter` function is not correctly handling the marker style and is not setting the face colors to an empty array as expected.

The bug in the `scatter` function seems to be related to the handling of the marker style and the determination of face and edge colors based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be applied to the `scatter` function:

1. When the marker style is unfilled, set the face colors to an empty array or modify the logic to skip setting face colors altogether.
2. Ensure that the marker style is correctly handled to determine whether the marker is filled or unfilled.

With these changes, the `scatter` function should work correctly for unfilled marker styles.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
# this is the corrected scatter function
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    Parameters

    """

    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=x, ydata=y, kwargs=kwargs)
    x = self.convert_xunits(x)
    y = self.convert_yunits(y)

    # ... (existing logic remains the same)

    c, colors, edgecolors = \

    # New logic to handle unfilled marker style
    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle) and not marker.is_filled():
        colors = None  # No face colors for unfilled marker
        edgecolors = 'face'  # Edge color will be the same as face color
        linewidths = np.ones_like(x) if linewidths is None else linewidths
