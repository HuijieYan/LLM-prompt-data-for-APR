The issue arises from the `scatter` function, where the use of the `mmarkers.MarkerStyle('o', fillstyle='none')` to create hollow markers is not being processed correctly. The expected behavior is to have hollow markers, but the actual behavior is not achieving this.

Upon further analysis, it is evident that the problem lies in the processing of the `fillstyle` parameter within the `scatter` function, where the handling of `fillstyle='none'` is not resulting in hollow markers as intended. This is likely due to an oversight in the implementation of marker style processing within the `scatter` function.

To fix the issue, the processing of the marker style, specifically the `fillstyle` parameter, needs to be adjusted to properly handle the case where `fillstyle='none'` is specified. This adjustment should result in the desired behavior of having hollow markers when using the specified marker style.

The corrected code for the `scatter` function, addressing the issue with the marker style processing, is as follows:

```python
# relative function's signature in the file
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (omitted code)

    marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)
    if marker_obj.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        edgecolors = 'face'
        if linewidths is None:
            linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
        elif np.iterable(linewidths):
            linewidths = [
                lw if lw is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']
                for lw in linewidths]

    # ... (remaining code)

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
        (path,), scales,
        facecolors=colors,
        edgecolors=edgecolors,
        linewidths=linewidths,
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha
    )
    collection.set_transform(mtransforms.IdentityTransform())
    collection.update(kwargs)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return collection
```

In this corrected implementation, the processing of the marker style is explicitly checked to determine if `fillstyle='none'` is specified. If so, the `edgecolors` are set to 'face' (indicating hollow markers) and the handling of `linewidths` is adjusted accordingly.

By applying this fix, the behavior of the `scatter` function is expected to align with the desired outcome, where hollow markers are correctly displayed when using the specified marker style.
