The error is occurring in the `test_scatter_unfilled` test case. The assertion `assert coll.get_facecolors().shape == (0, 4)` is failing because the actual shape is (3, 4) instead of (0, 4). This suggests that the markers are not being rendered as hollow as expected when using `markers.MarkerStyle('o', fillstyle='none')`.

The potential error location is within the `scatter` method where the marker edge color and face colors are being handled.

The issue is arising because the fillstyle parameter of the `markers.MarkerStyle` object is not being properly processed within the `scatter` method. The fillstyle parameter 'none' is not being recognized or properly applied to render the markers as hollow.

To fix this bug, the local variable `marker_obj` needs to be updated to include the fillstyle from the input `marker` parameter. Additionally, the edgecolors need to be handled differently according to the fillstyle: if the fillstyle is 'none', then the edgecolors should be set to the colors provided in the `c` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    """
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)  # Create marker object
    marker_obj._transform = marker_obj.get_transform()  # Ensure transform is applied
    if hasattr(marker, 'fillstyle') and marker.fillstyle == 'none':
        edgecolors = c  # Set edge color to the color provided in the 'c' parameter
    else:
        edgecolors = 'face'

    # ... (remaining part of the function)
```

With these updates, the `scatter` method should properly handle the `fillstyle` parameter of the `markers.MarkerStyle` object and render the markers as hollow when `fillstyle='none'`. This should resolve the issue and allow the test case `test_scatter_unfilled` to pass.
