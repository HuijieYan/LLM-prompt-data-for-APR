The error occurs because the function does not handle the case where the marker is hollow, i.e., when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. As a result, the `facecolors` attribute does not have the expected shape of (0, 4) indicated in the test. This is likely because the function does not properly process the `fillstyle` parameter for creating hollow markers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the case where the marker is hollow. This involves adjusting the logic related to the marker style and fillstyle in the function to ensure that hollow markers are created correctly. Specifically, when the `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the function should ensure that the `facecolors` attribute has the expected shape of (0, 4).

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):

    # Existing function implementation goes here...

    marker_style = None

    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_style = marker
    else:
        marker_style = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)

    # Check if the marker style is hollow
    if marker_style.get_fillstyle() == 'none':
        # Set facecolors to an empty array when the marker is hollow
        facecolors = np.empty((0, 4))
    else:
        # Handle the regular case of non-hollow markers
        # Process facecolors based on the provided parameters
        facecolors = self._parse_scatter_color_args(
            c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
            get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)[1]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the logic has been added to check if the provided marker style is hollow. If it is, the `facecolors` attribute is set to an empty array to represent the absence of color for the hollow markers. Otherwise, the function proceeds with processing the `facecolors` based on the regular case of non-hollow markers.

This approach ensures that the function properly handles the case of creating hollow markers, fulfilling the expectations of the test case.
