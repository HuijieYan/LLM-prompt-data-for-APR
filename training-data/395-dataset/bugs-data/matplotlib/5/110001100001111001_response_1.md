The buggy function appears to be incorrectly assigning the input parameter `linewidths` as a single value, but it is actually a list of values in the fourth case. This inconsistency is causing issues with the code execution.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `scatter` function to handle the `linewidths` parameter as a list of values. This modification should resolve the issue.

Here is the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
# Buggy function corrected code
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # Check if linewidths is a list or a single value
    if isinstance(linewidths, list):
        if len(linewidths) != x.size:
            raise ValueError("linewidths must be a scalar, or the same size as x and y")
        else:
            linewidths = np.ma.ravel(linewidths)
    else:
        linewidths = np.full(x.size, linewidths)

    # ... (rest of the code) ...
```

In this corrected code, we check if `linewidths` is a list or a single value. If it is a list, we ensure that its length matches the size of `x` and `y`. If it is a single value, we convert it to an array of the same length as `x` and `y`.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the scatter function works correctly in all cases.
