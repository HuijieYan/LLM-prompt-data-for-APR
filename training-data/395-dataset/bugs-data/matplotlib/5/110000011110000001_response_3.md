The error occurs in the test function `test_scatter_linewidths` where it is trying to assert that the `PathCollection` object's `get_linewidths` method returns the expected value. However, it seems that the `get_linewidths` method is returning a method reference instead of the actual linewidth value, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location is the implementation of the `scatter` method provided in the source code. It seems that there is an issue with how the `PathCollection` object is being handled and returned within the `scatter` method, leading to incorrect behavior during the test case.

The issue is likely occurring due to an incorrect implementation of the `scatter` method, possibly with how the `PathCollection` object is created and its properties are set within the method implementation.

To fix the bug, the `PathCollection` object should be correctly created and its properties should be set based on the input parameters. Additionally, the `get_linewidths` method should return the actual linewidth value instead of a method reference.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # Rest of the method implementation remains the same
    # ...
    # Existing code up to this point
    # ...

    # Original implementation of creating the PathCollection object
    # ...

    # Corrected implementation to set linewidths directly on the PathCollection
    # Set linewidths directly on the PathCollection object
    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
            (path,), scales,
            facecolors=colors,
            edgecolors=edgecolors,
            linewidths=linewidths,  # Set linewidths directly from input parameter
            offsets=offsets,
            transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
            alpha=alpha
            )

    # Rest of the method implementation remains the same
    # ...

    return collection
```

This corrected implementation ensures that the `PathCollection` object is properly created and its properties, including linewidths, are set based on the input parameters. This should address the issue encountered in the test function.
