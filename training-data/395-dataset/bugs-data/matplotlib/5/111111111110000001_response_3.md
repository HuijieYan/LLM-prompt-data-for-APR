The test_scatter_linewidths function is testing the scatter function within the Axes class. It creates a scatter plot and then checks the linewidths of the markers using the get_linewidths method.

The error message indicates that the assert statement is failing because the actual value of the marker linewidths is not equal to the expected value.

The potential error location within the scatter function is when setting the linewidths of the marker. It seems that there is an issue with how the linewidths are being handled or assigned to the markers.

The bug is likely occurring because the logic for setting and handling the linewidths of the markers in the scatter function is incorrect. This may be due to a mistake in the implementation of how the edge width is being assigned to the markers.

To fix the bug, the correction should involve reviewing and adjusting the logic related to setting the linewidths of the markers in the scatter function. The correction should ensure that the linewidths are correctly applied to the markers based on the input parameters and that the get_linewidths method returns the expected values.

Here's the corrected scatter function:
