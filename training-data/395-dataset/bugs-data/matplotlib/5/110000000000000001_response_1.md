The potential error location within the problematic function is the decorator usage. The decorator @_preprocess_data is being used to preprocess the data, but it seems to be causing issues in the function definition.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to the incorrect usage of the decorator or some compatibility issues with the decorator and the function signature.

Possible approach to fixing the bug would be to remove the decorator @_preprocess_data and also remove the decorator @cbook._delete_parameter as it seems to be causing issues as well.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : float or array-like, shape (n, )
        The data positions.

    s : float or array-like, shape (n, ), optional
        The marker size in points**2.
        Default is ``rcParams['lines.markersize'] ** 2``.

    c : array-like or list of colors or color, optional
        The marker colors. Possible values:

        [...] # Rest of the parameters remain unchanged

    """
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
