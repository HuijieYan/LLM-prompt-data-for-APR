The issue described in the GitHub problem seems to be related to the `scatter` function in Matplotlib not working as expected for the `linewidths` parameter.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `linewidths` parameter in the `scatter` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the implementation of the `scatter` method in Matplotlib version 3.1.0 may have changed, leading to issues with how the `linewidths` parameter is handled.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Reviewing the code for the `scatter` method in the Matplotlib version 3.1.0 codebase to identify any changes in the implementation related to the `linewidths` parameter.
- Checking the Matplotlib release notes for version 3.1.0 to see if there are any documented changes or bug fixes related to the `scatter` method and the `linewidths` parameter.
- Patching the code to resolve the bug based on the findings from the review and analysis.

Below is the corrected code for the `scatter` method in the problematic function with additional code comments to indicate the changes made:

```python
# this is the corrected scatter function
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (rest of the documentation comments)

    """
    # ... (rest of the method implementation)

    if not isinstance(linewidths, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("linewidths must be a scalar")
    
    linewidths = np.ma.ravel(linewidths)
    if len(linewidths) not in (1, x.size):
        raise ValueError("linewidths must be a scalar, or the same size as x and y")

    # ... (rest of the method implementation)
```

In the corrected code above, additional checks have been added to ensure that the `linewidths` parameter is properly handled. The input for `linewidths` is checked to verify it is a scalar or has the same size as `x` and `y`, and a `ValueError` is raised if the conditions are not met. This will address the bug related to the `linewidths` parameter not working as expected in the `scatter` method.
