The error seems to occur due to the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function not being called correctly inside the `scatter` method. The `get_next_color_func` parameter is not being passed with the correct value.

The issue is occurring because the `get_next_color_func` parameter is being called with `self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color`, which does not match the expected parameter `get_next_color_func` of the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function.

To fix the bug, we need to change the line where `get_next_color_func` is being assigned. Instead of passing `self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color`, we should pass the `get_next_color` function from the same class as the scatter method.

Here's the updated and corrected code for the `scatter` method.

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ...
    c, colors, edgecolors = \
        self._parse_scatter_color_args(
            c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
            get_next_color_func=self.get_next_color)  # Updated line

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    return collection
```

With this correction, the `scatter` method should work correctly with the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function and the error should be fixed.
