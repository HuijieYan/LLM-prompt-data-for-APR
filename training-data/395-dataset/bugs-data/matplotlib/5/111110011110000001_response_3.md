The error occurs in the test function `test_scatter_linewidths` where an assertion is made to check if the marker linewidth is equal to `i + 1`. The error message indicates that the test fails because it compares an array with a scalar value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely the `scatter` method. It seems that the `scatter` method does not return the expected result, and this is causing the test to fail.

Based on the error message and the code, it seems that the `scatter` method is not returning the correct linewidths for the markers, leading to the assertion error in the test function. This could be due to a bug in the calculation or assignment of the linewidths in the scatter method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `scatter` method correctly calculates and returns the linewidths for the markers based on the input parameters.

Here's the corrected `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):

    # ... omitted code ...

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
        (path,), scales,
        facecolors=colors,
        edgecolors=edgecolors,
        linewidths=linewidths,  # Include the linewidths parameter here
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha
    )
    # ... omitted code ...

    return collection
```
