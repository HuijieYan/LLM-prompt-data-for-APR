The test case is trying to assert that the linewidths of the scatter plot match the expected values for a given marker size. However, the error message indicates that the `pc.get_linewidths()` method is returning a bound method instead of the expected array of linewidths.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `scatter` method where the `pc` scatter collection is being returned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug might be that the `get_linewidths` method is not being called correctly or is returning something unexpected.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `scatter` method to properly return the linewidths for the scatter plot.

Here's the corrected `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
                    vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
                    verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
                    **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : float or array-like, shape (n, )
        The data positions.

    s : float or array-like, shape (n, ), optional
        The marker size in points**2.
        Default is ``rcParams['lines.markersize'] ** 2``.

    c : array-like or list of colors or color, optional
        The marker colors.

    ...

    Returns
    -------
    `~matplotlib.collections.PathCollection`

    ...

    """
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    collection.update(kwargs)

    if colors is None:
        collection.set_array(c)
        collection.set_cmap(cmap)
        collection.set_norm(norm)
        collection._scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)

    return collection, linewidths  # Return linewidths along with the collection
```

With this correction, the `scatter` method now returns the `collection` and `linewidths`. This modification allows the test cases to access the linewidths correctly.

This change ensures that calling `get_linewidths()` on the PathCollection object will return the expected array of linewidths.
