The issue is caused by the incorrect handling of the 'linewidths' parameter in the scatter function. The 'assert' statement in the test function is expecting the 'linewidths' to be equal to i + 1, but the 'get_linewidths' method returns a collection of linewidth values instead of a single value.

Therefore, the bug is located in the 'scatter' function, where the 'linewidths' are not handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'scatter' function to correctly handle the 'linewidths' parameter and ensure that it returns a single value for 'linewidths' in the case when a single value is provided.

Here is the corrected 'scatter' function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    linewidths = np.broadcast_to(linewidths, len(x))
    if len(linewidths) == 1:
        linewidths = float(linewidths)  # convert to a single scalar value

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the corrected code, we are using 'np.broadcast_to' to ensure that 'linewidths' has the same length as 'x' and 'y'. Then, we check if the length of 'linewidths' is 1, in which case we convert it to a single scalar value. This ensures that 'linewidths' is always a single value when a single value is provided.

By making these changes, we ensure that the 'scatter' function correctly handles the 'linewidths' parameter and returns a single value when appropriate, fixing the bug.
