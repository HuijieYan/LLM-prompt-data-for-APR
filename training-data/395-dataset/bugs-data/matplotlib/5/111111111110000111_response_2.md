The error occurs in the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with `pc.get_linewidths()`. The `get_linewidths` method is expected to return an array of linewidths, but it appears to be returning a method object.

The issue is caused by mistakenly calling `pc.get_linewidths` as a method, while it should be treated as an attribute to retrieve the linewidths of the scatter points.

To fix this, we need to update the `scatter` method to correctly handle the linewidths and return the expected results when `pc.get_linewidths()` is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
# Fixed scatter method
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (other parameter descriptions remain unchanged) ...

    """
    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    # (existing code...)

    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

    # ... (existing code...)

    offsets = np.ma.column_stack([x, y])

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
        (path,), scales,
        facecolors=colors,
        edgecolors=edgecolors,
        linewidths=linewidths,  # Corrected line to pass linewidths directly to PathCollection
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha
    )
    collection.set_transform(mtransforms.IdentityTransform())
    collection.update(kwargs)

    # ... (existing code...)

    return collection
```

In the corrected code, the `linewidths` parameter is correctly passed to the `PathCollection` object, allowing the `pc.get_linewidths()` method to retrieve the linewidths as expected. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect assertion in the test case and correctly display the scatter plot with varying marker thickness.
