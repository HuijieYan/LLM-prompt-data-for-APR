The issue reported is that the "linewidths" parameter doesn't work in the scatter function for Matplotlib version 3.1.0, but it works in an older version (1.3.1).

Upon analyzing the provided function `scatter`, it seems that the bug might be related to the implementation of the `edgecolors` and `linewidths` parameters within the function.

The likely reason for the bug in version 3.1.0 could be a change in the implementation of the `scatter` function with respect to the handling of `linewidths` and `edgecolors` parameters.

To fix the bug, the first step is to modify the implementation of the `scatter` function by ensuring that the `linewidths` and `edgecolors` parameters are properly handled in the code. This might involve adjusting how the `linewidths` and `edgecolors` are passed to the underlying plotting library.

Here's a possible corrected implementation of the function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous implementation remains unchanged) ...

    # Renamed the internal _parse_scatter_color_args to avoid conflict
    c, colors, edgecolors_parsed = \
        self._parse_scatter_color_args(
            c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
            get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)

    edgecolors = edgecolors_parsed  # Assign the parsed edgecolors
    # ... (remaining unchanged code) ...
```

By explicitly assigning the parsed `edgecolors` to the variable `edgecolors` within the `scatter` function, this approach aims to address the potential bug related to the `linewidths` and `edgecolors` parameters.

Additionally, changes to the implementation of `get_next_color` and `_parse_scatter_color_args` functions might also be necessary, but those are not apparent from the provided code snippet.

It's important to note that without full visibility into the underlying framework and other relevant sections of the codebase, this fix might need further adjustments based on the actual cause of the bug and the structure of the surrounding code.
