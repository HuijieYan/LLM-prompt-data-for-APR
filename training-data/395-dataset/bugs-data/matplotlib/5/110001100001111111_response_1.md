The issue seems to be related to the `linewidths` parameter not working as expected in the `scatter` function in Matplotlib version 3.1.0. It appears that the `linewidths` value is being overridden and is not having any effect on the markers' thickness.

To fix this issue, the `linewidths` parameter should be correctly handled inside the `scatter` function so that it takes effect on the markers' thickness as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    edgecolors, colors = self._parse_scatter_color_args(
        c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size, self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color
    )

    linewidths = np.broadcast_to(linewidths, x.size)  # Ensure linewidths has the same size as x and y

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the corrected code, the `linewidths` parameter is properly applied as an array to ensure that it has the same size as the input `x` and `y` arrays. This way, the `linewidths` value will correctly affect the thickness of the markers in the scatter plot, resolving the issue.

By making this change, the `scatter` function will now properly handle the `linewidths` parameter, allowing users to adjust the thickness of the markers when using scatter in Matplotlib version 3.1.0 and newer versions.
