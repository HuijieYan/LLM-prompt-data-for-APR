Bug summary

The interaction of setting axis limits and autoscaling changed in 3.2 with little guidance, introducing unexpected behavior that doesn't always make sense.

Code for reproduction

Here is a plot that looks very different on 3.1.2 and 3.2.1

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
f, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.arange(100)
y = np.random.uniform(-.1, .1, 100)
ax.scatter(x, y)
assert ax._autoscaleYon
ax.set_ylim((-.5, .5), auto=None)

Matplotlib version

Operating system: macOS
Matplotlib version: 3.2.1
Matplotlib backend (print(matplotlib.get_backend())): pylab inline
Python version: 3.7
```
