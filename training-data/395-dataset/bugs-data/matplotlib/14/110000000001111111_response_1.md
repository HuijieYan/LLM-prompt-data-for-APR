Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the order of the arguments in the function call to `update`. It seems like the `fontproperties` argument is being processed before the `size` argument, which is causing the `size` to be ignored.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function `update` is popping the `bbox` argument from `kwargs` before calling `super().update(kwargs)`. This means that any arguments that are dependent on the `bbox` (such as `size` and `fontproperties`) are being processed after the `bbox` is popped, resulting in the `size` being ignored when it's placed before `fontproperties` in the input arguments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Reorder the processing of the arguments within the `update` function so that the `bbox` is processed last, after the other font-related properties have been set.
2. Update the order of the input arguments when calling the `update` function to ensure that the `size` argument is processed after the `fontproperties` argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    
    # Extract font related properties first
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)

    # Update with remaining kwargs
    super().update(kwargs)

    # Set font related properties if available
    if fontproperties:
        self.set_fontproperties(fontproperties)
    if size:
        self.set_fontsize(size)

    # Set the bbox
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
``` 

This code processes the `fontproperties` and `size` arguments before updating with the remaining kwargs and then setting the `bbox` property at the end. This should ensure that the `size` is not ignored when placed before `fontproperties` in the input arguments.
