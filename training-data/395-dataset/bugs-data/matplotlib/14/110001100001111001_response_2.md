The buggy function `update` is designed to update the properties of a `Text` object in matplotlib. The function is supposed to handle various kwargs parameters, including the `bbox` parameter, which is used to set the bounding box for the text.

The bug in the function is that it incorrectly updates the `bbox` by calling the `self.set_bbox` method within the `update` function. This is problematic because the `bbox` requires a rectprops argument, not a string.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `update` function to properly handle the `bbox` parameter by checking its type and then calling the `set_bbox` method correctly with the rectprops argument.

Here's the corrected `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        if isinstance(bbox, dict):  # Assuming bbox is a dictionary with rectprops
            self.set_bbox(bbox)
        else:
            raise ValueError("bbox must be a dictionary with rectprops")
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the `bbox` parameter, ensuring that the `set_bbox` method is called with the correct rectprops argument.
