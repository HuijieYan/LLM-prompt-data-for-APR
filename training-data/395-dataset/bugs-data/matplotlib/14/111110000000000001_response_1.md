Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the update function where the bbox is being popped from the kwargs dictionary.

Reasons for the bug: When the bbox value is popped from the kwargs dictionary, if it is None, it is being assigned to the sentinel value, which can cause issues when checking for the bbox value later on.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of assigning the sentinel value as None, it would be better to assign it to a unique object that cannot be a valid bbox value.

Corrected code:

```python
    def update(self, kwargs):
        # docstring inherited
        # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
        sentinel = object()  # Use a unique object as the sentinel.
        bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
        super().update(kwargs)
        if bbox is not sentinel and bbox is not None:
            self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
