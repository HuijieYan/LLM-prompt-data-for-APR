The potential error in the given function is that the `update` method is defined twice in the `Text` class. The second definition is overwriting the first one, which is why it only contains the code to pop the "bbox" key from `kwargs` and then call `super().update(kwargs)`.

To fix this bug, the second definition of the `update` method needs to be removed, and the code in the first definition needs to be corrected to handle the "bbox" argument properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this corrected code, the `update` method properly handles the "bbox" argument and calls `super().update(kwargs)` to handle the remaining arguments.
