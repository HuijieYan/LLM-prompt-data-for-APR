The potential error location in the problematic function is the way it's handling the 'bbox' argument. The function is trying to pop the 'bbox' argument from the kwargs dictionary, and then it's calling the set_bbox() function. However, it's not guaranteed that the 'bbox' argument will always be present in the kwargs, and if it's not present, then calling self.set_bbox() will result in an error.

To fix this issue, we can check if the 'bbox' argument is present in the kwargs before trying to pop it and call the set_bbox() function.

Here's the corrected code for the update function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

This code first checks if the 'bbox' argument is present in the kwargs before trying to pop it. This will prevent any KeyError that might occur if the 'bbox' argument is not present.
