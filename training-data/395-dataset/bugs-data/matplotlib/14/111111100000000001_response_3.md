Potential error location:
The potential error is in the `update` method where the `super().update(kwargs)` is called before checking if the `bbox` is equal to the `sentinel` value.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `super().update(kwargs)` is called before an important conditional check for `bbox`, which can cause unexpected behavior if `bbox` is not equal to the `sentinel` value.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `bbox` is equal to the `sentinel` value before calling `super().update(kwargs)`. If `bbox` is not equal to the `sentinel` value, then we should update the bbox using the `set_bbox` method.

Corrected code:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
    super().update(kwargs)
```
