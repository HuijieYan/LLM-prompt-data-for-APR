The error message indicates that the test is failing because the size of the text is not being set correctly in the `plt.ylabel` call. This suggests that the `update` method is not correctly handling the `size` argument when it comes before `fontproperties`.

The potential error location is within the `update` method, where the `size` property needs to be properly handled.

The bug is occurring because the `update` method is not properly handling the `size` and `fontproperties` arguments. When the `size` and `fontproperties` arguments are passed together, the `size` argument is being ignored. This is leading to incorrect text sizing in the test case.

To fix this bug, the `update` method needs to correctly handle the `size` and `fontproperties` arguments. One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `update` method to properly handle both the `size` and `fontproperties` arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
# corrected update method
def update(self, kwargs):
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
    if fontproperties:
        self.set_fontproperties(fontproperties)
    if size:
        self.set_fontsize(size)
```

In this corrected version, we are explicitly handling the `fontproperties` and `size` arguments and calling the appropriate methods to set the font properties and size of the text. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect sizing of the text when `size` is placed before `fontproperties`.
