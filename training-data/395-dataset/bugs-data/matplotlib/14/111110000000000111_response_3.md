The bug seems to be related to the `size` argument being ignored if it is placed before `fontproperties`. This bug is likely occurring in the `update` function of the `Text` class, which is responsible for updating the text properties.

The reason for this bug could be that when the `update` function is called, it first pops the `bbox` argument from `kwargs` and then updates the properties using `super().update(kwargs)`. If `size` is placed before `fontproperties`, it might not be getting updated correctly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `update` function to handle the `size` argument before updating the properties using `super().update(kwargs)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)

    # Handle size before updating other properties
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)
    if size:
        self.set_size(size)

    super().update(kwargs)

    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
``` 

With this fix, the `size` argument should now be properly handled before updating other properties, and the issue of it being ignored when placed before `fontproperties` should be resolved.
