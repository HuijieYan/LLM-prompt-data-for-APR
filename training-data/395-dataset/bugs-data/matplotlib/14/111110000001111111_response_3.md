The issue here is that the `update` method in the `Text` class is not correctly updating the `bbox` attribute when it is provided in the `kwargs` dictionary. The `update` method is incorrectly handling the `bbox` attribute, and it is not being set properly. This results in the `bbox` not being updated as expected, leading to the incorrect rendering of the text.

To fix this issue, the `update` method should correctly handle the `bbox` attribute and set it as expected based on the provided value in the `kwargs` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method in the `Text` class:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this correction, the `bbox` attribute will be correctly updated when provided in the `kwargs` dictionary, ensuring that the text is rendered as expected.

This fix should address the issue where the "size" attribute is ignored if placed before "fontproperties" in the `kwargs` dictionary.
