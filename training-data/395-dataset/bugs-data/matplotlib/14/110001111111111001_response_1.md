Potential error location:

The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `update` method in the `Text` class. Specifically, when the `update` method is called with the `kwargs` parameter, it should update the font properties based on the passed arguments. However, it seems that the font properties are not being updated correctly, which results in the `get_size` method returning an unexpected size value.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug could be due to incorrect handling of font properties in the `update` method. It seems that the font properties are not being updated according to the provided kwargs, leading to incorrect font sizes being returned when accessing the `get_size` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check the implementation of the `update` method to ensure that it correctly handles the font-related kwargs and updates the font properties accordingly.
2. Verify that the `set_fontproperties` method is being called with the correct font properties from the `update` method.
3. Ensure that the font-related kwargs are being processed and applied to the text object within the `update` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Assuming the update method is part of the Text class

class Text:
    # ... other methods ...

    def update(self, kwargs):
        # docstring inherited
        # Update font properties
        sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
        bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
        fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
        if fontproperties:
            self.set_fontproperties(fontproperties)
        super().update(kwargs)
        if bbox is not sentinel:
            self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

In this corrected implementation, font properties are explicitly handled within the `update` method. If `fontproperties` are provided in the `kwargs`, they are extracted and passed to the `set_fontproperties` method to update the font properties. This should ensure that the font properties are updated correctly when the `update` method is called.
