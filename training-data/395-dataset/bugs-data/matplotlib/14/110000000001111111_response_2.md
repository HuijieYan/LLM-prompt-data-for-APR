The issue is with the order in which the arguments are passed to the `update` method. In some cases, the `bbox` argument is being ignored if it is placed before the `fontproperties`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `update` method to handle the `bbox` argument correctly, regardless of its position in the `kwargs` dictionary.

Here's the corrected `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

This fix ensures that the `bbox` argument is correctly processed and applied to the text element, regardless of its position in the `kwargs` dictionary.
