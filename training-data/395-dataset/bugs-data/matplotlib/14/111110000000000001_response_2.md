The potential error in the code is with the `update` function in the `Text` class. The function is not updating the bbox property correctly.

The bug in the code is that the `bbox` keyword argument is popped from the `kwargs` dictionary without checking if it exists. If the `bbox` keyword is not present in the `kwargs` dictionary, then `kwargs.pop("bbox")` will raise a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the code should check if the `bbox` keyword is present before popping it from the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
# this is the corrected update function
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel) if "bbox" in kwargs else sentinel
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
