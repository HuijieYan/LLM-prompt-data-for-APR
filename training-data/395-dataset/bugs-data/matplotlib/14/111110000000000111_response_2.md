The bug occurs in the `update` function of the `Text` class. When the `size` argument is placed before `fontproperties`, it is being ignored. This is likely due to the order of operations within the `update` function, where it first updates all the kwargs and then sets the bbox. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `size` argument is not ignored when placed before `fontproperties`. One approach is to modify the order of operations within the `update` function, so that it first sets the bbox and then updates the kwargs.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
    super().update(kwargs)
```

With this correction, the `size` argument should no longer be ignored when placed before `fontproperties`. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
