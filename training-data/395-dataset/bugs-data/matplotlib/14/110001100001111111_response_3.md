The issue seems to be with the handling of the "size" and "fontproperties" arguments in the function. It appears that when "size" is placed before "fontproperties", the "size" argument is ignored.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to ensure that both "size" and "fontproperties" arguments are handled correctly, regardless of their order in the input.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_14/lib/matplotlib/text.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def set_bbox(self, rectprops):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected implementation of the buggy function
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)
    
    super().update(kwargs)
    
    if fontproperties is not None:
        self.set_fontproperties(fontproperties)
    if size is not None:
        self.set_fontsize(size)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

This updated implementation ensures that both "size" and "fontproperties" are handled correctly, regardless of their order in the input.
