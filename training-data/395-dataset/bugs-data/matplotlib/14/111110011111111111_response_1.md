The bug in the `update` method of the `Text` class is causing the `size` argument to be ignored when it is placed before `fontproperties`. This issue is evident from the failed test case `test_fontproperties_kwarg_precedence`, which expects the size to be 40.0 for `text2`, but it actually returns 12.0.

The issue is occurring because the `size` argument is being ignored when `fontproperties` are already set. This is due to the pop operation on the `size` argument in the `update` method, which causes it to be removed from the `kwargs` dictionary, effectively ignoring its value.

To fix this bug, the `size` argument should be handled properly in the `update` method, ensuring that it is applied even if `fontproperties` are already set.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    
    fontsize = kwargs.get("fontsize")  # Get fontsize from kwargs
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    
    if fontsize is not None:  # If fontsize is provided in kwargs, apply it
        self.set_fontsize(fontsize)
    
    super().update(kwargs)
    
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this change, the `size` argument will be properly handled in the `update` method, ensuring that it is not ignored when `fontproperties` are already set. This should resolve the issue with the ignored `size` argument when placed before `fontproperties`.
