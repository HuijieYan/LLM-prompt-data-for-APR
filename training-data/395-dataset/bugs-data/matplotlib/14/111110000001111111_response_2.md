The bug occurs in the `update` function of the `Text` class. The function is not correctly updating the `bbox` attribute when it is provided in the `kwargs` dictionary.

The bug is likely caused by the order in which the `size` and `fontproperties` are processed in the function. When `size` is processed before `fontproperties`, it seems to be ignored.

To fix the bug, the `update` function should first update the `size` and then the `fontproperties`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    
    # Update size
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)
    if size is not None:
        # Update size logic here

    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

By updating the `size` before the `fontproperties`, we ensure that the `size` parameter is not ignored, and the bug should be resolved.
