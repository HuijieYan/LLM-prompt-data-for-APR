Potential error location: The potential error in the function lies in the line `super().update(kwargs)` where the `kwargs` dictionary is passed to the parent class's `update` method without unpacking it.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `kwargs` dictionary is not unpacked before calling the parent class's `update` method. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the parent class's `update` method expects individual keyword arguments instead of a dictionary.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to unpack the `kwargs` dictionary before passing it to the `super().update` method.

Corrected code:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(**kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
