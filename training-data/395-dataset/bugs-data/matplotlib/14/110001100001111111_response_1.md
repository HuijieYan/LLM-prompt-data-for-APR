The issue occurs because the `update` function is not correctly handling the `fontsize` and `fontweight` properties. The `update` function should first update the font properties before updating the bbox, as the bbox depends on the font properties.

To fix the issue, the code for the `update` function should be updated to ensure that the font properties are updated before the bbox. Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if "fontsize" in kwargs or "fontweight" in kwargs:
        self.set_fontproperties(kwargs)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this modification, the font properties will be set before updating the other properties and the bbox will be correctly updated based on the font properties.

Please note that the `set_fontproperties` method should be responsible for setting the font properties based on the input `kwargs`.

By making this change, the issue where the `size` property is ignored when placed before `fontproperties` should be resolved, and the expected outcome will be achieved.
