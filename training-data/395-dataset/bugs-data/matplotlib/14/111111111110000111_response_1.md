The error message from the test function indicates that the `size` attribute is not set properly when it is placed before the `fontproperties` attribute. This suggests that the `size` attribute is being overridden or ignored when `fontproperties` is specified.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `update` method of the `Text` class, specifically the part that handles the `size` attribute. It seems that when `fontproperties` are specified before `size`, the `size` attribute may not be properly updated.

The bug occurs because the `update` method does not handle the `size` attribute properly when it is specified after the `fontproperties` attribute. As a result, the `size` attribute is being overridden or ignored, leading to incorrect font size settings for the text.

To fix this bug, the `update` method should be modified to properly handle the `size` attribute when it is specified after `fontproperties`. The code should check for the presence of `size` in the `kwargs` and properly update the font size based on that.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    size = kwargs.pop("size", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if size is not sentinel:
        self.set_fontsize(size)
```

In the modified `update` method, the `size` attribute is properly handled using `kwargs.pop("size", sentinel)` to extract the `size` attribute from the `kwargs` dictionary. Then, if `size` is present, it calls `self.set_fontsize(size)` to update the font size accordingly. This code modification should address the issue where the `size` attribute is ignored or overridden when specified after `fontproperties`.
