Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is that the 'super().update(kwargs)' method may not work as intended.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug exists because the 'bbox' parameter is being popped from 'kwargs' before calling the super class's update method. This could result in unexpected behavior since the 'kwargs' dictionary is modified before calling the super method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we can update the method to first call the super class's update method and then handle the 'bbox' parameter separately.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    super().update(kwargs)
    bbox = kwargs.get("bbox", None)
    if bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
