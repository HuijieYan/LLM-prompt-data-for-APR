The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to use the `super()` function without specifying the base class. This can lead to errors because it's not clear which class the `super()` function should refer to.

To fix this bug, the correct base class should be specified for the `super()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)  # Assuming the base class for super() is known
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
