The buggy function here is `set_xlim`, which is used to set the x-axis view limits in a matplotlib plot. 

Looking at the code and the given runtime cases, it seems that there might be a problem with the handling of the `left` and `right` values. Additionally, there are some inconsistencies in checking and processing the `xmin` and `xmax` values. 

The issue seems to be occurring towards the end of the function where the `self._viewLim.intervalx` is assigned. 

It seems the function is not correctly assigning the `left` and `right` values to the `self._viewLim.intervalx`. It is possible that the calculation and assignment of these values are causing the function to return unexpected outputs.

A possible approach to fix this would be to refactor the last portion of the function that calculates and assigns the `left` and `right` values. The handling of `xmin` and `xmax` also needs to be in line with the logic of the rest of the function.

The corrected function is presented below:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    self._viewLim.intervalx = (left, right)
    if auto is not None:
        self._autoscaleXon = bool(auto)

    if emit:
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
        # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                               emit=False, auto=auto)
                if other.figure != self.figure:
                    other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()
    self.stale = True
    return left, right
```

In this corrected version, the `self._viewLim.intervalx` is directly assigned the `(left, right)` values without further calculations to ensure that the correct limits are set. The handling of `xmin` and `xmax` has also been updated to address their inclusion in setting the `left` and `right` values.
