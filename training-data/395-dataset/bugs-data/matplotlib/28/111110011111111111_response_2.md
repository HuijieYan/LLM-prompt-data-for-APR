Based on the error message, the issue seems to be related to the variable `old_left` being referenced before assignment. This implies that the variable `old_left` is being used without being assigned a value.

The buggy function `set_xlim` attempts to use the variable `old_left` without assigning it any value in some scenarios. This is the reason for the UnboundLocalError.

To fix this bug, we can assign a default value to `old_left` and `old_right` if they are not initialized earlier in the function.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    # ... omitted code ...

    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
    if left is None:
        left = old_left
    if right is None:
        right = old_right

    if self.get_xscale() == 'log' and (left <= 0 or right <= 0):
        cbook._warn_external(
            'Attempted to set non-positive limits on a log-scaled axis.\n'
            'Invalid limits will be ignored.')
        return

    if left == right:
        cbook._warn_external(
            f"Attempting to set identical left == right == {left} results "
            f"in singular transformations; automatically expanding.")

    # ... remaining code ...
```

In the corrected function, I have added a default assignment for `old_left` and `old_right` right after `self.get_xlim()` is called. This ensures that they have values before they are used in the subsequent code.

This correction should resolve the UnboundLocalError and ensure that the function functions as expected in the given test case.
