The potential error in the given function is the line `if right is None and np.iterable(left):`. The bug occurs because the logical condition is not checking if `left` is None first before checking if it's iterable. This can lead to unexpected behavior when setting the x-axis limits.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where `right` is None and `left` is an iterable. This can lead to incorrect setting of the x-axis limits.

To fix the bug, the logical condition should be modified to check if `left` is not None and if it's iterable. If both conditions are met, then `left` and `right` values should be unpacked from `left`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    if right is None:
        if left is not None and np.iterable(left):
            left, right = left
    ...
    # rest of the function remains the same
```
