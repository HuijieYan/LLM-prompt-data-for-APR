The error occurs due to the `UnboundLocalError`. This error is raised because the variable `old_left` is referenced before being assigned in the `set_xlim` function. This happens if the `left` value is None, and it tries to reference `old_left` before it's assigned a value.

To fix this issue, we can restructure the logic to assign `old_left` and `old_right` values outside the conditional block where they are used.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.
    ...
    """
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    # Move the assignment of old_left and old_right outside the conditional block
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()

    if left is None or right is None:
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right

    ...
```

By restructuring the logic and moving the assignment of `old_left` and `old_right` outside the conditional block, we ensure that they are assigned before being referenced, resolving the `UnboundLocalError` issue.
