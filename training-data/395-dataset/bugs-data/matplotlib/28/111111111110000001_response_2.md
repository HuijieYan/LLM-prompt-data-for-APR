The error message provided indicates that a variable 'old_left' is being referenced before assignment. This suggests that within the 'set_xlim' function, the variable 'old_left' is being used without being defined, which is causing the function to throw an 'UnboundLocalError'.

This error occurs because 'old_left' and 'old_right' are only defined and assigned to if 'left' or 'right' (respectively) are set to 'None' earlier in the function. If 'left' and 'right' are not 'None', then 'old_left' and 'old_right' will not be defined.

To fix this issue, the references to 'old_left' and 'old_right' need to be conditioned within the 'if' blocks where 'left' and 'right' are initially checked for 'None' value. If 'left' is not 'None', 'old_left' should only be referenced after 'left' has been assigned. The same applies to 'right', 'old_right', and their assignments.

The corrected code for the 'set_xlim' function is as follows:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
        """
        Set the x-axis view limits.
    
        .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        left : scalar, optional
            The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
            limit unchanged.
    
            The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
            (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
            the *left* keyword argument).
    
        right : scalar, optional
            The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
            limit unchanged.
    
        emit : bool, optional
            Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).
    
        auto : bool or None, optional
            Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
            False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.
    
        xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
            They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
            and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
            *xmax* and *right*.
    
        Returns
        -------
        left, right : (float, float)
            The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.

        set_xbound, get_xbound
        invert_xaxis, xaxis_inverted
    
        Notes
        -----
        The *left* value may be greater than the *right* value, in which
        case the x-axis values will decrease from left to right.
    
        Examples
        --------
        >>> set_xlim(left, right)
        >>> set_xlim((left, right))
        >>> left, right = set_xlim(left, right)
    
        One limit may be left unchanged.
    
        >>> set_xlim(right=right_lim)
    
        Limits may be passed in reverse order to flip the direction of
        the x-axis. For example, suppose *x* represents the number of
        years before present. The x-axis limits might be set like the
        following so 5000 years ago is on the left of the plot and the
        present is on the right.
    
        >>> set_xlim(5000, 0)
