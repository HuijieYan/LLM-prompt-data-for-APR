The buggy function is `set_xlim` inside the `_AxesBase` class. The function takes several optional arguments, such as `left`, `right`, `emit`, `auto`, and named arguments `xmin` and `xmax`.

It seems that the function tries to handle different combinations of input arguments but does so incorrectly, causing unexpected behavior.

In both buggy cases, the function tries to manipulate the values of `left` and `right` based on the input conditions involving `None` and iterable `left`. This may cause incorrect values to be used in the subsequent calculations, resulting in unexpected outputs.

The correction could involve simplifying the handling of input arguments and ensuring that the logic for manipulating the `left` and `right` variables is sound.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    ... (remaining function documentation)

    """
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        right = xmax
    if left is None:
        left = self._viewLim.intervalx[0]
    if right is None:
        right = self._viewLim.intervalx[1]

    self._viewLim.intervalx = (left, right)
    
    if auto is not None:
        self._autoscaleXon = bool(auto)

    if emit:
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                               emit=False, auto=auto)
                if other.figure != self.figure:
                    other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()
    self.stale = True
    return left, right
```

In the corrected code, the handling of `left` and `right` has been simplified, and default values are determined explicitly before any manipulation. This should prevent the unexpected behavior that was occurring in the original function.
