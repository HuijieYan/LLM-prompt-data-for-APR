The error message is indicating that the variable `old_left` is referenced before assignment, leading to an `UnboundLocalError` in the function `set_xlim`.

The bug occurs in the part of the function where it checks if `left` or `right` is None. In the scenario where one of them is None, it tries to assign the current limits using `self.get_xlim()`. However, in the current implementation, the variables `old_left` and `old_right` are not defined if `left` or `right` are None.

To fix this bug, one approach is to define `old_left` and `old_right` with None as their initial values and update them only if needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    # ... other code ...

    old_left, old_right = None, None  # Initialize with None
    if left is None or right is None:
        # Axes init calls set_xlim(0, 1) before get_xlim() can be called,
        # so only grab the limits if we really need them.
        old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right
    if self.get_xscale() == 'log':
        if left <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive left xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            left = old_left
        if right <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive right xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            right = old_right
    # ... other code ...
    return left, right
```

In the corrected code, `old_left` and `old_right` are initialized with None, and their values are updated only if necessary when `left` or `right` are None. This ensures that they are always defined when being used within the function.
