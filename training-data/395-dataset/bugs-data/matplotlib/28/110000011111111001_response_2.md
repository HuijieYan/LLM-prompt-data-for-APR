The error seems to be occurring because the variable `old_left` is referenced before assignment, which indicates that the condition `if left is None` is not being met.

The bug is due to the fact that the code is trying to use the `old_left` variable before it's assigned a value in the if statement. This happens because the condition `if left is None` is not met, so the `old_left` variable is never assigned a value before it is used.

To fix this bug, we can initialize the `old_left` and `old_right` variables with the current left and right limits received from `self.get_xlim()` respectively.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    ... ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.
    
        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).
    
    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.
    
    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).
    
    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.
    
    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.
    
    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.
