The error message indicates that the variable `old_left` is referenced before assignment, leading to an `UnboundLocalError`. This suggests that the variable `old_left` is being used without being initialized.

The bug is likely occurring in the conditional block:
```python
if left is None or right is None:
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
    if left is None:
        left = old_left
    if right is None:
        right = old_right
```
The issue is that the `old_left` and `old_right` variables are only defined within the nested scope of the conditional block. If the condition is not met, and `old_left` and `old_right` are not assigned, then referencing them later will lead to an `UnboundLocalError`.

One approach to fixing this bug would be to initialize `old_left` and `old_right` before entering the conditional block. This can be done by assigning them `None`, in case they are not assigned within the block.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    old_left, old_right = None, None  # Initialize old_left and old_right

    if left is None or right is None:
        old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

This modification ensures that `old_left` and `old_right` are initialized, avoiding the `UnboundLocalError` when referenced later in the code.
