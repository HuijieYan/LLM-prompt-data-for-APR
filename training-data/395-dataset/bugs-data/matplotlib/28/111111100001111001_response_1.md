It seems that the problematic function `set_xlim` is meant to set the x-axis view limits, however, there are several issues with its implementation.

One of the issues is that the function contains multiple references to `self.viewLim` and `self._viewLim`. It is not clear which one is the correct attribute to use, which might cause inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.

Another issue is the handling of different variables such as `left`, `right`, `self._autoscaleXon`, and calculation of the coordinates within the `if self.get_xscale() == 'log'` block. This might lead to unexpected results or errors.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to clarify the usage of `self.viewLim` and `self._viewLim`, ensuring consistent usage throughout the function. Additionally, the logic for handling `left` and `right` values, as well as the `self._autoscaleXon` attribute, should be reviewed and possibly refactored to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    if left is None or right is None:
        old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right

    if self.get_xscale() == 'log':
        if left <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive left xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            left = old_left
        if right <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive right xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            right = old_right
    if left == right:
        cbook._warn_external(
            f"Attempting to set identical left == right == {left} results "
            f"in singular transformations; automatically expanding.")
    left, right = self.xaxis.get_major_locator().nonsingular(left, right)
    left, right = self.xaxis.limit_range_for_scale(left, right)

    self.set_xbound(left, right)

    if auto is not None:
        self._autoscaleXon = bool(auto)

    if emit:
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
```

In this corrected code, the inconsistent use of `self.viewLim` and `self._viewLim` has been addressed, and the logic for handling `left` and `right` values, as well as `self._autoscaleXon`, has been reviewed to ensure correct behavior.
