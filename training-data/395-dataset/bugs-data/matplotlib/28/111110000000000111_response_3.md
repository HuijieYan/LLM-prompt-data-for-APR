The potential error in the provided function is with the following lines of code:

```python
if right is None and np.iterable(left):
    left, right = left
```

The issue is that it assumes if `right` is None, then `left` would be an iterable and can be unpacked as `(left, right)`. However, it doesn't check whether `left` is actually iterable or not before attempting to unpack it. This can lead to a TypeError if `left` is not iterable.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to explicitly check if `left` is iterable before attempting to unpack it. If it's not iterable, we can then assign `left` to both `left` and `right`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...

    """
    if right is None:
        if np.iterable(left):
            left, right = left
        else:
            right = left

    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...

    return left, right
```
