Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be occurring in the part of the code that handles setting up the axes limits and managing the autoscaling feature.

Reason for the Bug: The bug may be due to incorrect handling of the autoscaling and the left and right limits. In one test case, `left` and `right` are calculated incorrectly. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the `get_major_locator().nonsingular()` and `limit_range_for_scale()` function calls.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check the conditions for calculating `left` and `right`, and ensure that they handle the passed values correctly.
2. Verify the implementation of the `nonsingular()` and `limit_range_for_scale()` functions, as they may be causing issues related to the limits.

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """Set the x-axis view limits."""
    
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
    
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax
    
    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    self._viewLim.intervalx = (left, right)
    if auto is not None:
        self._autoscaleXon = bool(auto)

    if emit:
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(left, right, emit=False, auto=auto)
                if other.figure != self.figure:
                    other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()
    
    self.stale = True
    return left, right
