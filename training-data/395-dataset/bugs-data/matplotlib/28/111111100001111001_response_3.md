The function `set_xlim` in the provided code seems to have a bug. This method is used to set the x-axis view limits. The issue is with the condition `if right is None and np.iterable(left):` which is not handling the case when `right` is `None` and `left` is still a single value. 

In the first test case, the condition `if right is None and np.iterable(left):` will be True since `right` is `None` and `left` is iterable. This will lead to `left` and `right` being swapped which is not the desired outcome.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the condition `if right is None and np.iterable(left):` and instead use `if np.iterable(left) and len(left) == 2:` to check if `left` is iterable and contains 2 values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).

    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).

    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.

    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.

    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.
    """
    if np.iterable(left) and len(left) == 2:
        left, right = left

    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
With this change, the function should now handle the case where `left` is iterable and contain 2 values, resolving the bug.
