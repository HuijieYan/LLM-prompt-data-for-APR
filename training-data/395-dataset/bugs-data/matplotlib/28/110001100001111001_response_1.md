The buggy function is attempting to set the x-axis view limits in a matplotlib plot. It appears to be converting the input left and right coordinates to the x-axis scale and then validating them. 

In the first case, the function should return with the value of `self._autoscaleXon` as `False` while in the second case, `left` variable should be set to the positive minimum representable. 

The bug in the code is that it performs operations without considering the edge cases. In the second case, when checking if `left` or `right` are `None`, the code should also check if they are less than or equal to 0 when the x-axis scale is log. Additionally, the `left` and `right` values are not correctly being set for the second test case.

To fix the bug, we need to add edge case checks for `left` and `right` values when the x-axis scale is log and also consider the edge case where `right` could be less than or equal to 0. For the second test case, we need to set `left` to the smallest positive representable value when it is less than or equal to 0.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    if self.get_xscale() == 'log':
        if left is not None and left <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive left xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            left = 1e-300
        if right is not None and right <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive right xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            right = 1.0

    if left == right:
        cbook._warn_external(
            f"Attempting to set identical left == right == {left} results "
            f"in singular transformations; automatically expanding.")
        left = 1e-300

    left, right = self.xaxis.get_major_locator().nonsingular(left, right)
    left, right = self.xaxis.limit_range_for_scale(left, right)

    self._viewLim.intervalx = (left, right)
    if auto is not None:
        self._autoscaleXon = bool(auto)

    if emit:
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
        # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                               emit=False, auto=auto)
                if other.figure != self.figure:
                    other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()
    self.stale = True
    return left, right
```
