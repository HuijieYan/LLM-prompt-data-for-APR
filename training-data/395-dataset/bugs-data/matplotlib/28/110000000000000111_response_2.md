The potential error in the code is that the function is not handling the case where `left` and `right` are None. This is apparent from the line `if left is None or right is None`. The code is trying to get the current limits if either `left` or `right` is None.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The code does not handle the case where both `left` and `right` are None.
2. The code does not handle the case where `left` and `right` are None and `auto` is not None.

To fix the bug, we can use the following approach:
1. Check if both `left` and `right` are None, and if `auto` is not None, then use autoscaling to determine the limits.
2. Check if either `left` or `right` is None, and if True, then get the current limits and use them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    if left is None and right is None and auto is not None:
        self.autoscale(enable=auto, axis='x')
    else:
        # Get current limits if either left or right is None
        if left is None or right is None:
            old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
            if left is None:
                left = old_left
            if right is None:
                right = old_right

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    # Remaining code remains unchanged
    ...
    # Add the rest of the function here, code remains unchanged
```
