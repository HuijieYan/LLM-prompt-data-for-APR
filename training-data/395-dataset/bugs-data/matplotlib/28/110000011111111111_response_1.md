The error message indicates an "UnboundLocalError" because the variable "old_left" is referenced before assignment. This suggests that the `old_left` and `old_right` variables are not being properly initialized within the function, leading to the error.

The bug occurs because the `old_left` and `old_right` variables are conditionally assigned values, but there are paths through the preceding code that could result in these variables being referenced without being assigned. Specifically, when the `if` condition `left is None or right is None` is true, the `old_left` and `old_right` variables are assigned values retrieved from the `get_xlim` method. However, if this condition is not true, the `old_left` and `old_right` variables are referenced without being assigned.

To fix this bug, the conditional assignments of `old_left` and `old_right` should be removed from within the `if` statement and replaced with unconditional assignments before the `if` statement. This will ensure that `old_left` and `old_right` always have values assigned to them before being referenced.

The corrected code for the problematic function `set_xlim`:

```python
# Corrected function
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.
    (function body remains unchanged)

    """
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()  # Unconditionally assign values to old_left and old_right here

    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    if left is None or right is None:
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right

    # remaining code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By unconditionally assigning values to `old_left` and `old_right` before the `if` statement, we ensure that these variables are always initialized before being referenced, fixing the "UnboundLocalError" issue.
