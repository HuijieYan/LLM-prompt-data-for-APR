The potential error in the provided function is with the condition `if right is None and np.iterable(left):`. The intended logic seems to be checking if the `right` parameter is None and if the `left` parameter is iterable. However, the code is incomplete and incorrect as it does not provide proper handling for the iterable `left` condition.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `if right is None and np.iterable(left)` does not have a complete logic flow to handle the iterable `left` case.

To fix this bug, the condition `if right is None and np.iterable(left):` needs to be revised to include proper handling for the iterable `left` case.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *,
             xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.
    
    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).

    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).

    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.

    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.

    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.

    --------
    get_xlim
    set_xbound, get_xbound
    invert_xaxis, xaxis_inverted

    Notes
    -----
    The *left* value may be greater than the *right* value, in which
    case the x-axis values will decrease from left to right.
