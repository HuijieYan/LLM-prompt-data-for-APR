The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the `left` and `right` limits. In the first buggy case, when the `right` value is set to `1`, and the `left` value is set to `0`, it should return the `auto` value as `False`. However, in the second buggy case, when the `right` value is set to `10` and the `left` value is set to `-1`, it should return the `left` and `right` values after applying some calculations.

The buggy function is trying to handle the `left` and `right` limits using a complex set of conditions and checks to ensure the proper functioning. The issues in the function seem to be related to the conditional checks for `xmin` and `xmax` as well as the handling of the auto-scaling value.

To fix the bug, the function may need to be refactored to simplify the logic and ensure that the related parameters are handled correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    
    if xmin is not None:
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(left, right)
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    self._viewLim.intervalx = (left, right)

    if auto is not None:
        self._autoscaleXon = bool(auto)

    if emit:
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
    
    for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
        if other is not self:
            other.set_xlim(left, right, emit=False, auto=auto)
            if other.figure != self.figure:
                other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()

    self.stale = True
    return left, right
```

In the corrected function, the conditional checks for `xmin` and `xmax` have been simplified, and the handling of `left` and `right` limits is clarified. The set `_autoscaleXon` value has been corrected as well. This refactoring should fix the issues in the original function.
