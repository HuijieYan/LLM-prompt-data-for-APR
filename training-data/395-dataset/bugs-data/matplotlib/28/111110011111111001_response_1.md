The error message indicates that the variable `old_left` is being referenced before assignment, leading to an `UnboundLocalError`. This means that the variable `old_left` is used before a value is assigned to it within the `set_xlim` function.

The issue occurs because the conditional block that assigns values to `old_left` and `old_right` is inside the `if left is None or right is None` block and can be skipped if the condition is false, leading to the `old_left` and `old_right` variables being referenced before assignment.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `old_left` and `old_right` before the conditional block using default values so that they can always be referenced when the conditional block runs.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).

    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).

    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.

    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively, and it is an
        error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or *xmax* and *right*.

    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.
    """

    # Initialize old_left and old_right with default values
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    self.stale = True
    return left, right
```

By initializing `old_left` and `old_right` with default values before the conditional block, the `UnboundLocalError` will be resolved and the function should work as expected.
