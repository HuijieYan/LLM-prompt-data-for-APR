The bug in the `set_xlim` method is due to the comparison that checks if `right` is `None` and `left` is an iterable. If this condition is met, it assigns values to `left` and `right` in a way that potentially changes the intended values of `left` and `right`.

This is evident from the provided inputs for the buggy function:

```python
if right is None and np.iterable(left):
    left, right = left
```

The issue is that this condition is not considering both `left` and `right` being `None` or iterable simultaneously. This could lead to incorrect assignments of values to `left` and `right`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the condition to explicitly check for `left` and `right` being `None` separately. Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.
    
    ... (docstring remains unchanged) ...
    """

    if right is None:  # Check if right is None
        if xmin is not None:  # Check for xmin
            if left is not None:
                raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
            left = xmin
    else:  # If right is not None, process iterables like before
        if np.iterable(left):
            left, right = left

    if xmin is not None:  # Check for xmin and left again after the previous condition
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:  # Check for xmax and right
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right')
        right = xmax

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
``` 

This modified code explicitly handles the cases when `left`, `right`, `xmin`, and `xmax` are `None` or iterables, ensuring that the correct values are assigned without ambiguities. This modification should fix the bug in the `set_xlim` method.
