The buggy function `set_xlim` is supposed to set the x-axis view limits for a plot in a matplotlib AxesSubplot. However, there are several issues with the function.

In the first buggy case, the input parameters are `left=0`, `right=1`, `emit=True`, and `auto=False`. The function should set the x-axis limits within the given bounds, but the buggy function fails to do this.

The function incorrectly processes the `left` and `right` values when `right` is `None` and `left` is iterable. It also does not correctly handle the `xmin` and `xmax` values and does not validate them properly. Additionally, the function does not check for the case when the `left` and `right` values are equal, which results in a warning message but does not handle this case properly.

To fix the function, the processing of the `left` and `right` values should be modified to handle different cases properly. The `xmin` and `xmax` values should be validated and if provided, should overwrite the `left` and `right` values. It should also properly check for cases when `left` is greater than `right`. 

Here's the corrected code for the function with these fixes:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.
    
    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.
    
        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).
    
    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.
    
    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).
    
    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.
    
    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.
    
    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.
    """
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    
    if xmin is not None:
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        right = xmax

    if left > right:
        left, right = right, left
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this corrected code, the function should handle the provided input properly and set the x-axis limits accordingly.
