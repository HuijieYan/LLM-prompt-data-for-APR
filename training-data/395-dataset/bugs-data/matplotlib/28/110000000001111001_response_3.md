The issue with the provided function is that it appears to be a method of a class, but it is not written as an instance method. It does not take 'self' as the first parameter, which is required for instance methods to access the properties and methods of the class.

To fix this bug, the first parameter 'self' should be added to the function definition. This will allow the function to access the properties and methods of the class to which it belongs.

Here's the corrected code for the function/method:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    # Rest of the method remains the same...

    """
    # The rest of the method body remains the same
    # ...
```

By adding 'self' as the first parameter in the function definition, this function can now access the properties and methods of the class to which it belongs, and the bug should be fixed.
