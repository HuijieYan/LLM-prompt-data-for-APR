Bug summary

Constrained_layout creates extra axes when used with subgridspec. This is specific to using a subgridspec and axes added to positions from the gridspec, as well as the subgridspec.

The extra axes shadows the underlying axes, such that e.g. mouse-events are ignored. Is is the underlying issue of this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59663421/matplotlib-button-not-working-when-in-nested-gridspec

Code for reproduction

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)

gs = fig.add_gridspec(2, 1)

ax1 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])

gs2 = gs[1, 0].subgridspec(1, 2)
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(gs2[0, 0])
ax3 = fig.add_subplot(gs2[0, 1])

print(len(fig.axes))  # prints 3 (as expected)   
fig.canvas.draw()
print(len(fig.axes))  # prints 4

for ax, color in zip(fig.axes, plt.cm.tab10.colors):
    pos = ax.get_position()
    rect = plt.Rectangle((pos.x0, pos.y0), width=pos.width, height=pos.height,
                         color=color, alpha=0.4, transform=fig.transFigure)
    fig.add_artist(rect)

plt.show()

There are four axes in the figure, the one in red is undesired.

Expected outcome

Three axes.

Note

If ax1 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0]) is replaced by

gs1 = gs[0, 0].subgridspec(1, 1)
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(gs1[0, 0])
no extra axes is present. Also, without constrained_layout, the issue is not present.
