The issue seems to be related to the marker properties in the boxplot. The test function 'test_boxplot_marker_behavior' is trying to ensure that markers for the boxplot elements (whiskers, caps, boxes, medians) are set to empty strings ('') and not overridden by rcParams['lines.marker'] setting.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of marker properties for the boxplot elements, specifically during the creation of the boxplot elements like whiskers, caps, boxes, and medians. The assertion error in the test case indicates that the markers are not being set to empty strings as expected.

The bug seems to be occurring because the boxplot function does not correctly handle the marker properties for the boxplot elements, resulting in the rcParams['lines.marker'] setting overriding the marker properties for the boxplot elements.

To fix the bug, the boxplot function needs to ensure that the marker properties for the boxplot elements are explicitly set and not overridden by rcParams['lines.marker'] setting. This can be done by modifying the internal logic of the boxplot function to handle marker properties for the boxplot elements independently of the rcParams['lines.marker'] setting.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function 'bxp':

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.

    Make a box and whisker plot for each column of *x* or each
    vector in sequence *x*. The box extends from the lower to
    upper quartile values of the data, with a line at the median.
    The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the
    data. Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.

    ... (docstring continues)

    for line in ['whiskers', 'caps', 'boxes', 'medians']:
        for element in self.bxp_handle[line]:
            element.set_marker('')

    # (Rest of the existing code)

    return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

By explicitly setting the marker properties for the boxplot elements within the 'bxp' function, the bug can be fixed, ensuring that the rcParams['lines.marker'] setting does not override the marker properties for the boxplot elements.
