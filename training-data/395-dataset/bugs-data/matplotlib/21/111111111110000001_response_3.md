The test case `test_boxplot_marker_behavior` in the `test_axes.py` file of the matplotlib library is to ensure that the marker properties are correctly set for various components of the boxplot. It checks whether the marker properties are correctly overridden by default values.

The error message is indicating that the assertion `each_line.get_marker() == ''` is failing because the marker for `each_line` is not as expected. This indicates that there might be a problem with the setting of the marker for the boxplot components.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the marker properties for the boxplot components are being set.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The boxplot function is not correctly overriding the marker properties as defined by the test case.

Approaches for fixing the bug would involve:
1. Checking how the marker properties for boxplot components are being handled and overriding the default values.
2. Ensuring that the properties defined in the test case are correctly applied while drawing the boxplot.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    @cbook._rename_parameter("3.1", "manage_xticks", "manage_ticks")
    def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
            patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
            showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
            boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
            medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
            meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None, **kwargs):  # Add **kwargs
            # ... implementation of the bxp function with marker properties ...
        
        # ... validation and drawing of the components ...

        return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                    medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

In the corrected code, a catch-all `**kwargs` parameter is added to account for any custom properties that might need to be set for the boxplot. This allows for more flexible customization of the boxplot function.
