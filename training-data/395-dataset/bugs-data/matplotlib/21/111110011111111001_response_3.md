The error is occurring in the `test_boxplot_marker_behavior` test case, where the assertion `assert each_line.get_marker() == ''` is failing. This means that the `get_marker()` method is returning a value of 's' instead of an empty string, which indicates that the marker parameter is not being overridden as expected.

The potential error location within the `bxp` function is the handling of the `meanprops` and `flierprops` where the marker is expected to be overridden with an empty string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code doesn't correctly override the marker properties using the `rcParams` settings, leading to unexpected marker values being used.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the marker properties are correctly overridden with the values from `rcParams` before being used to draw the boxplot.

Here's the corrected version of the `bxp` function:

```python
# Corrected bxp function
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.
    (Remaining code unchanged as per original implementation)
    """
    # (Remaining code unchanged as per original implementation)

    for bxp_lines in ['whiskers', 'caps', 'boxes', 'medians']:
        for each_line in bxp_handle[bxp_lines]:
            each_line.set_marker('')
    
    # Ensure that markers for fliers and means aren't overridden with ''
    bxp_handle['fliers'][0].set_marker('o')
    bxp_handle['means'][0].set_marker('^')

    return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

In the corrected code, after creating the boxplot (`bxp_handle`), the marker properties are explicitly set to override any values from `rcParams` to ensure the correct markers are used. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass as expected.
