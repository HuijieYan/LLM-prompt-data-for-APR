The error message is caused by the assertion `assert each_line.get_marker() == ''`. This assertion is checking if the marker for each line is an empty string, but it seems that the intention was to check if the marker is not overridden by an empty string.

The potential error location in the code is the handling of markers for fliers, means, and lines.

The bug is occurring because the code does not properly handle the marker properties for lines, fliers, and means in the `bxp` function. It seems that the code is not correctly applying the markers based on the `rcParams` configuration.

To fix the bug, the markers for the lines, fliers, and means need to be set according to the `rcParams` configuration. Additionally, the assumption that overriding with an empty string should ensure the markers are not changed needs to be validated.

Here is the corrected code for the `bxp` function:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.
    ...
    """
    # Lists of artists to be output
    whiskers = []
    caps = []
    boxes = []
    medians = []
    means = []
    fliers = []

    # ...

    # Apply marker properties from rcParams
    flier_marker = mpl.rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.marker']
    mean_marker = mpl.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.marker']

    # ...

    def doplot(*args, **kwargs):
        return self.plot(*args, marker='', **kwargs)

    # ...

    # Apply markers
    fliers.extend(doplot(flier_x, flier_y, marker=flier_marker, **final_flierprops))

    # ...

    if showmeans:
        if meanline:
            means.extend(doplot([box_left, box_right], [stats['mean'], stats['mean']],
                                marker=mean_marker, **final_meanprops))
        else:
            means.extend(doplot([pos], [stats['mean']], marker=mean_marker, **final_meanprops))

    # ...

    return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```
In this corrected code, the `doplot` function is used to apply the correct markers for lines, fliers, and means based on the `rcParams` configuration. The `marker` parameter is set to the respective marker properties (`flier_marker` and `mean_marker`) when calling `doplot`. Additionally, when calling `doplot` for lines, the `marker` parameter is explicitly set to an empty string to ensure that it is not overridden by any other marker properties.
