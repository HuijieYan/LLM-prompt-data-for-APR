The issue is related to the markers in the boxplot being affected by the `lines.marker` setting in the `matplotlibrc` file. This setting should only apply to regular line plots, not boxplots.

The potential error location is within the `bxp` function of the `Axes` class. The function handles the plotting of boxplots and uses `lines.Line2D` properties, including markers.

The bug occurs because the `bxp` function references the global `rcParams` directly, which causes it to use the marker setting for lines, affecting boxplots. This leads to unexpected marker behavior in boxplots, as observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `bxp` function should use marker settings specific to boxplots and not rely on the global `rcParams` directly. Specifically, the function needs to use the appropriate marker properties for the different components of the boxplot (e.g., whiskers, caps, boxes, medians, fliers, means).

The corrected code for the `bxp` function:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True, patch_artist=False,
        shownotches=False, showmeans=False, showcaps=True, showbox=True,
        showfliers=True, boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None, meanline=False,
        manage_ticks=True, zorder=None, marker=None):
    # ... rest of the function

    if marker is None:
        # Use marker settings from rcParams if not specified
        marker = rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.marker']
    
    # Use the marker setting in the appropriate plot components
    final_whiskerprops['marker'] = marker
    final_capprops['marker'] = marker
    final_flierprops['marker'] = marker
    final_medianprops['marker'] = marker
    final_meanprops['marker'] = marker

    # ... rest of the function
```

In the corrected code:
- The `bxp` function now accepts an additional `marker` parameter.
- If `marker` is not provided, it defaults to the marker setting specific to boxplots (`rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.marker']`).
- The marker setting is applied to the relevant components (whiskers, caps, fliers, medians, means) within the boxplot.

This change ensures that the `bxp` function uses the appropriate marker setting for boxplots, independent of other global settings.
