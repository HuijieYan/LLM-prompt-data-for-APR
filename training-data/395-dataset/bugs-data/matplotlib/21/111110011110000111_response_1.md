The error occurs when the test function tries to assert that the `lines.marker` is overridden by '' for lines including 'whiskers', 'caps', 'boxes', and 'medians', but the test fails because the markers are not being overridden properly.

The bug seems to be in the `bxp` function of the 'Axes' class where it handles setting the markers for different elements of the boxplot. The bug appears to be related to the way the `meanline` and `meanprops` are handled in overriding the marker property.

The reason behind the bug is that the `meanline` property is not being handled correctly in the `bxp` function. When `meanline=True` and `meanprops` is not None, the line properties object fails to properly override the marker property.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling `meanline` and `meanprops` should be revised in the `bxp` function. The marker property should be handled explicitly and overridden correctly according to the logic defined in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `bxp` function:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
   
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    # maybe draw the means
    if showmeans:
        if meanline:
            means.extend(doplot(
                [pos], [stats['mean']], **final_meanprops
            ))
            means[0].set_marker('')
        else:
            means.extend(doplot(
                [pos], [stats['mean']], **final_meanprops
            ))
            means[0].set_marker(final_meanprops.get('marker', ''))

    # ... (rest of the function)

    return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

In the corrected code, after adding the means to the plot, the marker property is explicitly set based on the `final_meanprops`. The `set_marker` method is called to override the marker property with the appropriate value from `final_meanprops`. This approach ensures that the marker property is handled correctly, overriding any conflicting configurations from `final_meanprops`.
