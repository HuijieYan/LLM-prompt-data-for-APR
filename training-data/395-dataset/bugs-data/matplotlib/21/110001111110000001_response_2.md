The error occurs in the `test_boxplot_marker_behavior` function. This function sets some rcParams (runtime configuration settings) related to markers and then attempts to assert certain conditions about the markers of the boxplot.

The buggy function is `bxp` which is supposed to be a drawing function for box and whisker plots. Within this function, there are multiple instances of nested functions like `line_props_with_rcdefaults`, `to_vc`, and `dopatch` among others. There are also multiple instances of parameters being passed among these inner functions.

The error occurs because the function `line_props_with_rcdefaults` does not properly handle the `meanprops` attribute, leading to an assertion failure in the test function.

To fix this bug, the handling of the `meanprops` attribute in the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function should be revised. This involves checking if `meanprops` is `None` and only if it's not `None,` should a certain property be set. Additionally, it is also important to ensure that the parameters and their defaults are consistent with the usage within the functions.

The corrected code for the problematic function `bxp` is as follows:

```python
# importing required libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
import matplotlib.lines as mlines
import matplotlib.path as mpath
import matplotlib.ticker as mticker
from numbers import Number

def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.

    This is the corrected implementation of the bxp function with the necessary fix.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged) ...
    """
    # function implementation remains the same as the original implementation
    # with the fixed definition of line_props_with_rcdefaults
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged) ...
```

The corrected `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function is:

```python
def line_props_with_rcdefaults(subkey, explicit, zdelta=0):
    d = {k.split('.')[-1]: v for k, v in plt.rcParams.items()
         if k.startswith(f'boxplot.{subkey}')}
    d['zorder'] = zorder + zdelta
    if explicit is not None:
        d.update(cbook.normalize_kwargs(explicit, mlines.Line2D._alias_map))

    # additional handling for meanprops attribute
    if "meanprops" in d and explicit is not None and "linestyle" not in explicit:
        d["linestyle"] = ''
    return d
```
