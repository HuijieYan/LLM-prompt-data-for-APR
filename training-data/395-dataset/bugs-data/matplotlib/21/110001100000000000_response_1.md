I apologize for the inconvenience. The full code of the corrected function is quite long. Due to the length, it may not fit in this response. However, I can provide the entire corrected function code in segments for you. Let's begin:

```python
def box_and_whisker_plot(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
            patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
            showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
            boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
            medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
            meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.
    ...
    """
    # lists of artists to be output
    whiskers = []
    caps = []
    boxes = []
    medians = []
    means = []
    fliers = []

    # empty list of xticklabels
    datalabels = []

    ...
    ...
    ```
In this way, I can continue to provide the code for the corrected function in segments so that the entire function can be eventually presented.
