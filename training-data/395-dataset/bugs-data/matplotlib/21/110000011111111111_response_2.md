The error message in the test function is related to the use of markers in the boxplot. The test function expects that the `rcParams['lines.marker']` is overridden by an empty string, but this doesn't happen, leading to an AssertionError.

The potential error location is likely in the function that processes the parameters to create the boxplot (`bxp` function). Specifically, the part where it handles the markers for the different elements of the boxplot such as whiskers, caps, boxes, medians, fliers, and means.

The reason behind the bug is that the `lines.marker` setting in the matplotlibrc file is not being overridden for the boxplot, causing unexpected behavior in the test case.

To fix the bug, you can modify the code to ensure that the `lines.marker` setting is properly overridden for the boxplot markers. This may involve explicitly handling the marker settings within the `bxp` function to ensure that they are not affected by the global `lines.marker` setting.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    def patch_list(xs, ys, **kwargs):
        verts, codes = to_vc(xs, ys)
        path = mpath.Path(verts, codes)
        patch = mpatches.PathPatch(path, **kwargs)
        
        # Update marker settings to override rcParams['lines.marker']
        if 'marker' in kwargs and kwargs['marker'] is not None:
            patch.set_marker(kwargs['marker'])
        return [patch]

    # ... (existing code)

    if showfliers:
        # fliers list in the form [flier_x, flier_y, flierprops]
        flier_x = np.full(len(stats['fliers']), pos, dtype=np.float64)
        flier_y = stats['fliers']

        # Apply marker setting for fliers
        if 'marker' in final_flierprops and final_flierprops['marker'] is not None:
            fliers.extend(doplot(
                flier_x, flier_y, marker=final_flierprops['marker']))
        else:
            fliers.extend(doplot(
                flier_x, flier_y, **final_flierprops))
    
    # ... (remaining code)

    return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

In this corrected code, the function explicitly handles marker settings for different elements of the boxplot, ensuring that they are not affected by the global `lines.marker` setting.
