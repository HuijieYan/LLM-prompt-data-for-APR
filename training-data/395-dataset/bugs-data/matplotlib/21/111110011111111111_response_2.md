The error occurs due to the assertion failure at the line `assert each_line.get_marker() == ''` in the test function. This failure indicates that the markers are not being set to an empty string as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function might be in the section that handles the marker properties for the boxplot elements.

The bug occurs because the marker properties are not being correctly overridden by the default settings, resulting in the unexpected behavior observed in the test case.

To fix this bug, the marker properties should be explicitly set to an empty string for the relevant elements of the boxplot. This will ensure that the markers are overridden by the default settings specified in the configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the `bxp` function of the `Axes` class:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Ensure that markers for fliers and means are not overridden with '' by explicitly setting the marker properties
    final_flierprops['marker'] = ''  # Override flier marker with empty string
    final_meanprops['marker'] = ''  # Override mean marker with empty string

    # ... existing code ...
```

By explicitly setting the marker properties for fliers and means to an empty string, this corrected code ensures that the default marker settings are properly applied, fixing the bug and addressing the unexpected behavior observed in the test case.
