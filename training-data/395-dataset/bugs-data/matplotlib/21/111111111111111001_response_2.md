The bug is occurring in the `bxp` method of the `Axes` class. The `dot` method is used to draw different components of the boxplot such as whiskers, caps, boxes, medians, and fliers. Within the `dot` method, various properties such as zorder, marker, facecolor, etc. are being set based on the rcParams (runtime configuration parameters).

The bug occurs because the `marker` attribute is being explicitly set to an empty string (`''`) for all the lines in the boxplot, overriding the values from rcParams. This is causing the assertion error in the test function.

To fix this bug, the `marker` property for the lines in the boxplot should not be forcibly set to an empty string. Instead, it should be left to be determined by the rcParams.

Here's the corrected code for the `bxp` method:

```python
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ...

    @cbook._rename_parameter("3.1", "manage_xticks", "manage_ticks")
    def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
            patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
            showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
            boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
            medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
            meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
        """

        # ... (other code remains the same)

        for pos, width, stats in zip(positions, widths, bxpstats):
            # ... (other code remains the same)

            # maybe draw the box:
            if showbox:
                if patch_artist:
                    boxes.extend(dopatch(box_x, box_y, **final_boxprops))
                else:
                    boxes.extend(doplot(box_x, box_y, **final_boxprops))

            # draw the whiskers
            whiskers.extend(doplot(

            ))
            whiskers.extend(doplot(

            ))

            # maybe draw the caps:
            if showcaps:
                caps.extend(doplot(cap_x, cap_lo, **final_capprops))
                caps.extend(doplot(cap_x, cap_hi, **final_capprops))

            # draw the medians
            medians.extend(doplot(med_x, med_y, **final_medianprops))

            # maybe draw the means
            if showmeans:
                if meanline:
                    means.extend(doplot(
                        [box_left, box_right], [stats['mean'], stats['mean']],
                        **final_meanprops
                    ))
                else:
                    means.extend(doplot(
                        [pos], [stats['mean']], **final_meanprops
                    ))

            # maybe draw the fliers
            if showfliers:
                # fliers coords
                flier_x = np.full(len(stats['fliers']), pos, dtype=np.float64)
                flier_y = stats['fliers']

                fliers.extend(doplot(
                    flier_x, flier_y, **final_flierprops
                ))

        # ... (other code remains the same)
```

This change ensures that the `marker` property for the lines in the boxplot is not forcibly set to an empty string, allowing it to be determined by the rcParams.
