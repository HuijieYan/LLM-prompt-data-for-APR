The test case 'test_boxplot_marker_behavior' is aimed at testing the behavior of markers within a boxplot. It sets certain marker properties, creates a boxplot with specific data and checks the marker properties of the lines created in the boxplot.

The error message states that the assertion `assert each_line.get_marker() == ''` has failed. The value of the property 'marker' for the line created in the boxplot is 's' instead of the expected '' (an empty string).

Upon analyzing the function 'bxp', it is found that the 'line_props_with_rcdefaults' function might not be handling the marker property appropriately. 

The markers are set based on the rcParams, but it seems that these settings are not correctly applied to each line during the boxplot creation. This could be due to some discrepancies in handling the marker properties within the 'line_props_with_rcdefaults' function.

To fix this bug, the 'line_props_with_rcdefaults' function should be modified to handle the 'marker' property correctly. It should respect the settings provided in the rcParams and assign marker properties accordingly to the lines being created in the boxplot.

Here's the corrected code for the 'bxp' function:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True, patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True, boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None, meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    # code implementation

    if not isinstance(marker, str):
        marker = rcParams['lines.marker']

    meanmarker = rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.marker']
    fliermarker = rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.marker']
    
    def line_props_with_rcdefaults(subkey, explicit, zdelta=0):
        d = {k.split('.')[-1]: v for k, v in rcParams.items() if k.startswith(f'boxplot.{subkey}')}
        d['zorder'] = zorder + zdelta
        if explicit is not None:
            d.update(cbook.normalize_kwargs(explicit, mlines.Line2D._alias_map))
        if 'marker' in d:
            if subkey == 'flierprops' and fliermarker:
                d['marker'] = fliermarker
            elif subkey == 'meanprops' and meanmarker:
                d['marker'] = meanmarker
            else:
                d['marker'] = marker
        return d
    
    # rest of the code
```
The modification ensures that the 'marker' property is handled appropriately based on the rcParams settings. If specific markers are defined in the rcParams for fliers or means, those are respected; otherwise, the general marker defined in the rcParams for lines is used.
