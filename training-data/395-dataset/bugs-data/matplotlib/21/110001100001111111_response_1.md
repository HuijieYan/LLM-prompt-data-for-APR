The issue seems to be related to the handling of the 'marker' property in boxplot rendering caused by the setting 'lines.marker: s' in the matplotlibrc file. This unexpected behavior is likely due to a conflict with boxplot rendering when the 'lines.marker' property is set to 's' in matplotlibrc.

To fix this bug, the handling of the 'marker' property in the boxplot rendering code should be reviewed in relation to the 'lines.marker: s' setting in the matplotlibrc file. It might be necessary to ensure that the boxplot rendering does not utilize the 'marker' property when 'lines.marker' is set to 's', or to provide a specific exception for the boxplot rendering.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if not patch_artist:
        final_boxprops = line_props_with_rcdefaults('boxprops', boxprops)
    
    # ... (rest of the code) ...
```

In this corrected code, specifically when 'patch_artist' is False, the 'final_boxprops' is defined using 'line_props_with_rcdefaults' without attempting to retrieve the 'marker' property. The 'marker' property is omitted from 'final_boxprops' to avoid potential conflicts and ensure that the lines.marker setting does not interfere with boxplot rendering. If 'patch_artist' is True, the boxprops would be handled separately, but without including the 'marker' property if it's set to 's' in the matplotlibrc file.
