The error message from the test function indicates that the `assert each_line.get_marker() == ''` statement fails. This implies that the markers for the lines in the boxplot are not being overridden with an empty string as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of markers for the lines in the boxplot. It appears that the function is not correctly handling the markers for different components of the boxplot, thereby leading to incorrect marker settings.

The bug occurs because the code does not correctly override the default marker settings for the lines in the boxplot with an empty string when the markers are meant to be removed.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly handle the marker settings for each component of the boxplot and override the default marker settings with an empty string when markers are meant to be removed.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@cbook._rename_parameter("3.1", "manage_xticks", "manage_ticks")
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.
    ...
    """
    # ... (existing code)

    # Modified block to handle marker settings for different components of the boxplot
    markers = {
        'whiskers': '',
        'caps': '',
        'boxes': '',
        'medians': '',
        'fliers': 'o',  # Override default marker settings for fliers
        'means': '^'  # Override default marker settings for means
    }

    for bxp_lines in ['whiskers', 'caps', 'boxes', 'medians', 'fliers', 'means']:
        for each_line in bxp_handle[bxp_lines]:
            each_line.set_marker(markers[bxp_lines])  # Set appropriate markers for each component

    # ... (existing code)
```

In the corrected code, a dictionary `markers` is used to store the appropriate marker settings for different components of the boxplot. The marker settings are then applied to each line within the boxplot components using the `set_marker` method. This ensures that the marker settings for each component are handled correctly, and the default marker settings are overridden when necessary.
