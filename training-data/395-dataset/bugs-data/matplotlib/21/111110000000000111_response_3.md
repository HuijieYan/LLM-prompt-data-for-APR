The bug is likely related to the use of the `lines.marker : s` setting in the matplotlibrc, which unexpectedly affects the markers in boxplots.

The potential error location within the provided function is the use of the `lines.marker : s` setting and its impact on the boxplot function.

The bug occurs because the `lines.marker : s` setting in the matplotlibrc file affects the marker style used in boxplots. This is unexpected behavior and not conducive to the intended usage of the boxplot function.

To fix the bug, the `lines.marker` setting in the matplotlibrc file should not impact the marker style used in boxplots.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    """
    ... (omitted code) ...
    """

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # this is the corrected function

            patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
            showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
            boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
            medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
            meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
        """

        # ... (omitted code) ...
