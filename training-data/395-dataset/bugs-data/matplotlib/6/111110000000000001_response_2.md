The potential error location within the problematic function is in the function signature, as it needs to include the 'self' parameter since it's a method of a class. This is why it's throwing an error that it takes 7 positional arguments but 8 were given. This is a common error in Python when defining a method within a class and missing the 'self' parameter in the function signature.

To fix the bug, we need to include the 'self' parameter in the function signature. Additionally, we need to remove the '@staticmethod' decorator, since it's a method of a class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(self, c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    """
    Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.
    ...
    """
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
