The error occurs in the `invalid_shape_exception` function within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of RGB/RGBA color input and the expected behavior when passing a 2D array with a single row for a single color.

The reason behind the bug is that the code currently does not correctly handle the case when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row. Instead of using the provided single color, the code attempts to interpret the input as multiple colors, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method must be modified to correctly handle the case when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row. This can be achieved by updating the logic within the method to recognize and use the single color input as intended, instead of treating it as multiple colors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    c_is_string_or_strings = (
        isinstance(c, str)
        or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
            and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))

    if not c_was_none and c_is_string_or_strings:
        c = np.tile(c, (xsize, 1))

    return c, None, edgecolors
