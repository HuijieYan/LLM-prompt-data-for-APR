The test case `test_scatter_single_color_c` is testing the `scatter` function with different color inputs. It appears that the error is related to the `scatter` function and its handling of color inputs.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `invalid_shape_exception` function. It seems to be defined incorrectly and might be causing issues with the validation of color inputs.

The reason behind the bug might be that the `invalid_shape_exception` function is defined within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method, but it is also defined as a standalone function outside of the class. This dual definition could be causing conflicts during execution.

To fix the bug, the `invalid_shape_exception` function should be removed from the `parse_scatter_color_args` method and defined as a standalone function outside of the class. This will ensure that it can be called properly and does not conflict with its other definition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def invalid_shape_exception(csize, xsize):
    return ValueError(
        f"'c' argument has {csize} elements, which is inconsistent "
        f"with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")

def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize,
                              get_next_color_func):

    Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.

    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                        " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                        " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err

            edgecolors = kwcolor
