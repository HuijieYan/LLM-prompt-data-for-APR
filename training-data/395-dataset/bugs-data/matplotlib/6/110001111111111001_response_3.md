The error message indicates that the images generated by the `test_scatter_single_color_c` test case are not close, with a root mean square (RMS) difference of 5.043 between the expected and actual images. This suggests that the scatter plot outputs are different than the expected ones, possibly due to incorrect color representations in the scatter plot.

After analyzing the code, it appears that the bug might be in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function. The handling of color-related arguments and their precedence might be causing issues, especially when dealing with different color representations.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the color arguments and their precedence correctly. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect color representations in the scatter plots, causing the failed image comparison in the test case.

To fix the bug, we should review the logic for handling color-related arguments and ensure that it follows the correct precedence rules. Additionally, we need to address the conversion of different color representations (e.g., lists, arrays) to ensure consistency and accurate color mapping in the scatter plots.

Below is the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        kwcolor = np.asarray(kwcolor)  # Convert to ndarray for consistent handling
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code:
1. We ensure that the color representations are consistent by converting `kwcolor` to a NumPy array if it is not None.
2. We maintain the precedence rules for color-related arguments as per the description.
3. We address the handling of edgecolors and facecolors to ensure consistent and accurate color mapping in the scatter plots.

After applying these corrections, the `test_scatter_single_color_c` test case should generate the expected scatter plots, resolving the image comparison failure.
