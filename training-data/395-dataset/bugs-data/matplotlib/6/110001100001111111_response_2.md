The issue is related to the handling of the `c` parameter in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function. The code checks the shape of the input `c` and tries to determine if it represents a single color or a sequence of colors. However, the logic for determining the shape and type of the input `c` is inconsistent, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for determining the shape and type of the input `c`. We should also ensure that when a single color is provided, it is applied to all scatter elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                            " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                            " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor
    
    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    c = np.broadcast_to(c, (xsize, c.shape[-1])) if c is not None else None
    facecolors = np.broadcast_to(facecolors, (xsize, facecolors.shape[-1])) if facecolors is not None else None
    
    colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c) if c is not None else None
    
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In this corrected code, we use NumPy's `broadcast_to` function to ensure that the input `c` and `facecolors` have the correct shape and type. We also remove the unnecessary checks for `c` being a string or a sequence of strings, which were leading to incorrect behavior.

By making these changes, we ensure that when a single color is provided for `c`, it is applied to all scatter elements, resolving the bug related to multiple colors being produced for a single RGB/RGBA input.
