The test case `test_scatter_single_color_c` is associated with a comparison failure between the generated test image and the expected reference image. The error message indicates that the images are not close, with a root mean square (RMS) difference of 5.043.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method. This method is responsible for processing color-related arguments for the scatter plot, including determining the facecolors, edgecolors, and handling color-related kwargs. The error seems to be related to how the method handles single RGB/RGBA color input.

The bug occurs because the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method does not handle the single RGB/RGBA color input provided as a 2D array with a single row correctly. This leads to multiple different colors being used for the scatter elements instead of the expected single color.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method should be modified to correctly handle the single RGB/RGBA color input provided as a 2D array with a single row. It should extract the RGB/RGBA color values from the 2D array and assign them to all the scatter elements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... existing code ...

    if isinstance(c, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(c) == 1:
        if len(c[0]) == 3:  # RGB color
            c = [c[0] for _ in range(xsize)]
        elif len(c[0]) == 4:  # RGBA color
            c = [c[0] for _ in range(xsize)]

    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    # ... remaining code ...
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, we introduced conditional checks to handle the single RGB/RGBA color input as a 2D array with a single row. If the input matches this condition, we assign the RGB/RGBA color values to all the scatter elements, ensuring that they all have the same color.

By making this change, the bug related to scatter producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input should be resolved.
