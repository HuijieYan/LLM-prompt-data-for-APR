The issue is that when a single RGB or RGBA color is provided, it should be reflected consistently across all scatter plot elements, but instead, multiple colors are being displayed. This occurs when providing a 2D array with a single row as the c argument input.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part that processes the color argument and attempts to handle the single RGB or RGBA input.

The bug occurs because the code does not adequately handle the case when a single RGB or RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row. Instead of using the provided color for all plot elements, it seems to default to mapping the color.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to recognize the specific case of a single RGB or RGBA color provided as a 2D array with a single row and to apply that color consistently to all plot elements.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize,
                              get_next_color_func):
    # Existing implementation...

    c_was_none = c is None
    c = np.asanyarray(c)
    valid_shape = c.shape == (1, 3) or c.shape == (1, 4)

    if not c_was_none and kwcolor is None and valid_shape:
        facecolors = c
        c = ("b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    # Remaining implementation...

    return c, facecolors, edgecolors
```
