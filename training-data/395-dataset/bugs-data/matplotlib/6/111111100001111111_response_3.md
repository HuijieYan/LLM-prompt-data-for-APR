The bug occurs in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function because it does not correctly handle the case where a single RGB or RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row.

The function incorrectly converts the single RGB or RGBA color to multiple colors, resulting in each point having a different color.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly handle the case where a single RGB or RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row by ensuring that all points are assigned the same color.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... (other code remains the same) ...
    
    if isinstance(c, (list, np.ndarray)):
        c = np.array(c)
        if c.ndim == 2 and c.shape[0] == 1:  # Check if c is a 2D array with a single row
            if c.shape[1] == 3:  # RGB color
                c = np.tile(c, (xsize, 1))  # Repeat the 1x3 array to match xsize
            elif c.shape[1] == 4:  # RGBA color
                c = np.tile(c, (xsize, 1))  # Repeat the 1x4 array to match xsize

    # ... (remaining code remains the same) ...

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where a single RGB or RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row, and all points will have the same color as expected.
