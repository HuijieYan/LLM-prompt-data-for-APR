The error occurs when the `test_scatter_single_color_c` function is run and compares the resulting image with the expected image. The error message indicates that the two images are not close, with a Root Mean Square (RMS) difference of 5.043.

The potential error location within the `test_scatter_single_color_c` function is likely related to the scatter plot creation using the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class.

The bug in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function is likely due to the mishandling of color arguments and their precedence. The function attempts to process color-related arguments for the scatter plot, but there are potential issues with the logic for handling different color sources.

To fix the bug, the logic for processing color-related arguments should be carefully revised to ensure that the proper precedence rules are followed and that the expected behavior for color assignment in scatter plots is maintained.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... (same function signature and docstring)
    
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    if facecolors is None:
        facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', None)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    # Revised logic to handle color precedence
    if kwcolor is not None:
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if c is None:
            c = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    # ... (remaining logic remains the same)
    
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, the handling of color arguments and their precedence has been revised to ensure that the proper color values are assigned based on the specified rules. This should address the bug and allow the `test_scatter_single_color_c` function to run successfully without encountering image comparison failures.
