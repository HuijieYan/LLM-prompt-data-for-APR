The error occurs when using the `scatter` function to plot data points, where a single RGB/RGBA color is not applied to all points as expected. The image comparison failure suggests that the produced plot contains multiple colors instead of a single RGB/RGBA color for all scatter elements.

The error seems to be related to the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, where the logic for processing the color-related arguments of the `scatter` function is implemented. It appears that the function does not handle the case of providing a single RGB/RGBA color correctly, resulting in the unexpected behavior.

One possible reason for this bug is that the function does not correctly identify and handle the case when a single RGB/RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row. As a result, the code that processes the color arguments may not be able to differentiate between a single RGB/RGBA color and a sequence of colors.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function should be modified to correctly handle the case of providing a single RGB/RGBA color as a 2D array with a single row. This may involve updating the logic for processing the color-related arguments to specifically check for this case and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None and not np.iterable(c):
            facecolors = np.broadcast_to(kwcolor, (xsize, len(kwcolor)))

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        # Updated logic to handle single RGB/RGBA color as a 2D array with a single row
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    
    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

By updating the logic to handle the case of providing a single RGB/RGBA color as a 2D array with a single row, the function should now correctly process the color-related arguments for the `scatter` function.
