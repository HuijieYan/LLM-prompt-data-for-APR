The error message is related to the comparison of images, indicating that there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual output of the `test_scatter_single_color_c` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method, specifically in the area where it handles the color arguments and their precedence.

The bug seems to be happening because the function is not correctly handling the color arguments and their precedence, leading to incorrect color assignment in the scatter plots. This is causing the discrepancy in the comparison of the test and reference images.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method needs to correctly prioritize and process the color arguments to ensure that the scatter plots are rendered consistently and as expected.

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be an color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode'] else get_next_color_func())
    
    c_is_string_or_strings = (isinstance(c, str) or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0 and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))
    
    if c is not None and not isinstance(c, str) and not c_is_string_or_strings and len(c) != xsize:
        raise ValueError(f"'c' argument has {len(c)} elements, which is inconsistent with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")
    
    colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c) if c is not None else None
    
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```
In the corrected code, the method now prioritizes and processes the color arguments based on their precedence, ensuring that the scatter plots are rendered correctly. Additionally, it performs appropriate checks to handle different types and sizes of color arguments.
