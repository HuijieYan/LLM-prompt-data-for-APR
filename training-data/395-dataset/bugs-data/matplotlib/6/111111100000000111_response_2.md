The bug is related to the way scatter plots handle the input of a single RGB/RGBA color. When a 2D array with a single row is passed, the scatter plot elements are displaying multiple different colors instead of all having the same color.

The bug is located in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method of the `Axes` class in the matplotlib library. The method is responsible for processing color-related arguments of scatter plots, and it seems to mishandle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as input.

The bug occurs because the method incorrectly handles the input of a single RGB/RGBA color. When a 2D array with a single row is passed, the method fails to recognize it as a single color for all points and treats it as multiple different colors, leading to the unexpected behavior in scatter plots.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is passed. It should recognize the 2D array with a single row as a single color for all points and ensure that all points have the same color.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' "
                         "kwarg but not both; they differ but "
                         "their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be an color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())

    # Check if c has a valid shape
    if not c_was_none and c.size in (3, 4):
        c = [c]  # Convert c to a 2D array with a single row

    colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, the method checks if the input `c` has a size of 3 or 4, indicating an RGB or RGBA color. If so, it converts `c` to a 2D array with a single row, ensuring that it is recognized as a single color for all points in the scatter plot. This modification should fix the bug and produce the expected outcome where all points have the same color.
