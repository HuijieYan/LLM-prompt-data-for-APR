The issue seems to be occurring in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method. It is not handling the single RGB or RGBA color input correctly and is producing multiple colors for a single input. This is evident from the test function and the error message, as it states that images are not close, indicating that the colors of the scatter points are not as expected.

The bug is likely occurring because the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method is not handling the single RGB or RGBA color input as a special case. Instead, it is treating it as an iterable of colors, resulting in multiple colors being produced.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method to handle the single RGB or RGBA color input as a special case. When the input is a 2D array with a single row, it should set the color of all the scatter points to the specified RGB or RGBA color.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... (other code remains the same) ...

    if isinstance(c, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(c) == 1 and len(c[0]) in (3, 4):
        # If c is a list or numpy array with a single row and 3 or 4 elements,
        # set the facecolor and edgecolor to the specified color for all points.
        c = c[0]
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = c
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = c
    else:
        c_was_none = c is None
        if c is None:
            c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
                 else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
                 else get_next_color_func())
        c_is_string_or_strings = (
            isinstance(c, str)
            or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
                and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same) ...

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

With this modification, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method should now handle the single RGB or RGBA color input correctly and produce the expected results. This should resolve the bug where scatter points were getting multiple colors even with a single RGB/RGBA input.
