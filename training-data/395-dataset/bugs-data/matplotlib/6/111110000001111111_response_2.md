The bug occurs when a single RGB or RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row for the `c` argument, resulting in scatter plot elements having multiple different colors instead of the expected single color.

The potential error location is within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, where the invalid shape check does not handle the case of a single RGB or RGBA color provided as a 2D array with a single row.

To fix the bug, the invalid shape check in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function should be modified to handle the case of a single RGB or RGBA color provided as a 2D array with a single row. Specifically, the code should check if the input `c` has the shape `(1, 3)` for RGB or `(1, 4)` for RGBA, and if so, convert it to a 1D array before processing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... (other code remains the same) ...

    if c.size == 3 or c.size == 4:
        c = c.ravel()

    c_is_mapped = False  # Unless proven otherwise below.
    valid_shape = True  # Unless proven otherwise below.
    if not c_was_none and kwcolor is None and not c_is_string_or_strings:
        try:  # First, does 'c' look suitable for value-mapping?
            c = np.asanyarray(c, dtype=float)
        except ValueError:
            pass  # Failed to convert to float array; must be color specs.
        else:
            # If c can be either mapped values or a RGB(A) color, prefer
            # the former if shapes match, the latter otherwise.
            if c.size == xsize:
                c = c.ravel()
                c_is_mapped = True
            else:  # Wrong size; it must not be intended for mapping.
                if c.size in (3, 4):
                    _log.warning(
                        "'c' argument looks like a single numeric RGB or "
                        "RGBA sequence, which should be avoided as value-"
                        "mapping will have precedence in case its length "
                        "matches with 'x' & 'y'.  Please use a 2-D array "
                        "with a single row if you really want to specify "
                        "the same RGB or RGBA value for all points.")
                valid_shape = False

    # ... (other code remains the same) ...

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

This modification will handle the case of a single RGB or RGBA color provided as a 2D array with a single row, ensuring that the scatter plot elements will have the expected single color.
