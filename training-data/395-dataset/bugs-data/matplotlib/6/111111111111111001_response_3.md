The error occurs when the `scatter` method is called with the `c` parameter and a color is specified using the `color` parameter.

The potential error in the function lies in the implementation of the `invalid_shape_exception` function. This function is used to raise a ValueError when the shape of the input 'c' is not consistent with the size of 'x' and 'y'.

The bug occurs because the function `invalid_shape_exception` is defined within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method. This causes the function to have access to the local variables within `_parse_scatter_color_args` which are different each time the method is called.

To fix the bug, the `invalid_shape_exception` function should be defined outside the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method to ensure that it does not rely on the local variables of the method. Additionally, the logic for checking the shape consistency of 'c' with 'x' and 'y' should be revisited to ensure it works as intended.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def invalid_shape_exception(csize, xsize):
    return ValueError(
        f"'c' argument has {csize} elements, which is inconsistent "
        f"with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")


@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    """
    Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.
    ... (rest of the method remains the same)
    """
```

By making the `invalid_shape_exception` a standalone function, it now operates independently of the local variables in `_parse_scatter_color_args`, ensuring consistent behavior across different calls.
