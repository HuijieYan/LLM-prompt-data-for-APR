The error message indicates that the test is failing because the scatter plot is producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input. This suggests that the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, which processes the color-related arguments for `.Axes.scatter`, is not handling single RGB/RGBA inputs as expected.

The bug is likely occurring in the section of the function that processes the color inputs and checks for valid shapes. It appears that the function is incorrectly handling single RGB/RGBA inputs, leading to the generation of multiple colors instead of a single color for all scatter elements.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle single RGB/RGBA inputs. This could involve modifying the logic for checking the shape of the input color arrays and ensuring that they are treated as a single color when required.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize,
                              get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c = c if c is not None else (facecolors if facecolors is not None else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode'] else get_next_color_func())
    colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the color inputs has been modified to ensure that single RGB/RGBA inputs are processed correctly and used as a single color for all scatter elements. The input color is now directly used to generate the color array, and the unnecessary shape checks have been removed. This should address the bug related to producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input in scatter plots.
