Based on the issue description, the problem occurs when providing a single RGB/RGBA color for all scatter elements. This is supposed to be achieved by passing a 2D array with a single row for the `c` argument input. However, when the shape of `x`/`y` is 3 and RGB is passed as a 2D array with a single row, or when the shape is 4 and RGBA is passed as a 2D array with a single row, the plot elements have several different colors instead of all having the same color.

The potential error location within the `Axes._parse_scatter_color_args` function is likely in the section where it attempts to handle the scenario of providing a single RGB/RGBA color for all scatter elements.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the logic within the `Axes._parse_scatter_color_args` function to correctly handle the scenario of providing a single RGB/RGBA color for all scatter elements. This may involve ensuring that a 2D array with a single row is properly handled and that all plot elements receive the same color when this input is provided.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    if c is None:
        if facecolors is not None:
            c = facecolors
        else:
            c = "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode'] else get_next_color_func()

    colors = None
    if np.iterable(c):
        if len(c) == 1:
            c = c[0]
        else:
            colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
    else:
        c = np.asanyarray(c, dtype=float)
        c_is_mapped = True
        if c.size != xsize:
            raise ValueError("'c' argument has an invalid number of elements.")

    return c, colors, edgecolors
