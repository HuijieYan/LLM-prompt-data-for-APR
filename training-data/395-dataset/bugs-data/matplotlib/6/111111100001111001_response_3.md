Potential error location: The error might be occurring within the `invalid_shape_exception` function, as it is currently nested inside the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function and does not seem to serve any purpose or be called within the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `invalid_shape_exception` function is defined inside the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, but it is not being used or called within the function. This nested function definition seems unnecessary and could potentially cause confusion.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the nested definition of the `invalid_shape_exception` function from the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, as it does not appear to be used within the function. This will simplify the code and prevent any potential confusion.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:
