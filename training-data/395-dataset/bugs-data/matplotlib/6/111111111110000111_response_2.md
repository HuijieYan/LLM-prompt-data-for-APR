The error occurs because the facecolor and edgecolor are not being set properly when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row. This results in the scatter plot elements having multiple different colors instead of the expected single color.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a single RGB/RGBA color is provided as a 2D array, it is properly handled and applied to all scatter plot elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
# corrected `_parse_scatter_color_args` function
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    """
    Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.
    ... (other comments remain the same)

    Returns
    -------
    c
        The input *c* if it was not *None*, else a color derived from the
        other inputs or defaults.
    colors : array(N, 4) or None
        The facecolors as RGBA values, or *None* if a colormap is used.
    edgecolors
        The edgecolor.

    """
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    if c is not None and len(c) == 1:
        facecolors = c

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but"
            " their functionalities overlap."
        )

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead."
            ) from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    c_is_string_or_strings = (
        isinstance(c, str)
        or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
            and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))

    # The rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, if `c` is not None and has a length of 1 (indicating a single RGB/RGBA color provided as a 2D array), it is assigned to `facecolors` to ensure that all scatter plot elements have the same color.

After making this change, the test case for `scatter_single_color_c` should pass without producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input.
