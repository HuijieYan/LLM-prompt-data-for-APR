The potential error in the given function is that it is not properly checking for the existence of a key before popping it from the `kwargs` dictionary. This can lead to a KeyError if the key does not exist in the dictionary.

The reason behind the bug is that the function assumes the existence of certain keys in the `kwargs` dictionary without actually checking for their presence.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly check for the existence of each key before attempting to pop it from the `kwargs` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize,
                              get_next_color_func):
    # ... function description ...

    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    c_was_none = c is None  # moved this line up

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be an color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    # ... remaining code ...
```

The corrected code addresses the issue by first checking for the existence of the keys in the `kwargs` dictionary before attempting to pop them. This prevents the function from throwing KeyErrors.
