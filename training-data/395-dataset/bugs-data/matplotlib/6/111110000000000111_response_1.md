The issue is related to the behavior of the `scatter` method in Matplotlib when passing a single RGB/RGBA color for all scatter elements. When passing a 2D array with a single row for the `c` argument input, the scatter plot produces multiple colors for each element instead of using the specified single color for all elements.

The potential error location is within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method of the `Axes` class.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling the single RGB/RGBA color input is not correctly implemented. The method does not recognize the single color input and processes it as if it were multiple colors, resulting in the unexpected behavior of the scatter plot.

To fix the bug, the method should be modified to properly handle the case when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row.

The corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method is as follows:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())

    colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```
