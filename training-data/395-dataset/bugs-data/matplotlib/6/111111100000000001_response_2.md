The potential error location within the problematic function is the `invalid_shape_exception` function, which is defined inside the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method of the `Axes` class.

The bug occurs because the `invalid_shape_exception` function is defined twice within the `Axes` class. This causes a conflict and does not allow proper referencing of the function.

To fix the bug, the `invalid_shape_exception` function should be removed from its current location and defined as a separate non-static method outside the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected separate definition of the invalid_shape_exception function
    def invalid_shape_exception(self, csize, xsize):
        return ValueError(
                f"'c' argument has {csize} elements, which is inconsistent "
                f"with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")

    @staticmethod
    def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize,
                                  get_next_color_func):
        """
        Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.
    
        Argument precedence for facecolors:

        """
        facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
        facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
        edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
        kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
        if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
            raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                             " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                             " their functionalities overlap.")
        # remaining code...
