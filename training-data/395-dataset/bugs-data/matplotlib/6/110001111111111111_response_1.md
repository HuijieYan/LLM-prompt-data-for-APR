The issue seems to be related to the way colors are handled in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method. The method is not correctly handling the case when a single RGB or RGBA color is passed in as a 2D array.

Upon analyzing the input parameter values and expected variable values before the function return, it seems that the method tries to convert the single RGB or RGBA color to an array, but the logic for handling this conversion is flawed.

The reason behind the bug is that the method incorrectly handles the case when a single RGB or RGBA color is passed as a 2D array. This results in multiple colors being used for scatter elements instead of a single color.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling the conversion of a single RGB or RGBA color to an array. The method should correctly handle the case when a single color is provided and ensure that all scatter elements use the same color.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        kwcolor_array = np.asarray(kwcolor)
        if len(kwcolor_array.shape) == 1:
            kwcolor_array = kwcolor_array[np.newaxis]
        
        if kwcolor_array.ndim == 2 and kwcolor_array.shape[0] == 1:
            kwcolor = kwcolor_array[0]
        
        if mcolors.is_color_like(kwcolor):
            if edgecolors is None:
                edgecolors = kwcolor
            if facecolors is None:
                facecolors = kwcolor
    
    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())

    c = np.asarray(c)
    
    if c.ndim == 2 and c.shape[0] == 1:
        c = c[0]
        
    if c.size != xsize and c.size in (3, 4):
        c = np.tile(c, (xsize, 1))
    
    colors = None
    if mcolors.is_color_like(c) or (c.ndim > 1 and c.shape[1] in (3, 4)):
        colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
        colors = colors if len(colors) > 1 else np.broadcast_to(colors, (xsize, 4))
        
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the revised code, I added a logic to handle the case when a single RGB or RGBA color is provided as a 2D array. The method checks the shape of the color array and processes it accordingly. Additionally, I made sure to convert the color to an RGBA array if necessary, and then broadcast it to match the size of the `x` and `y` arrays.

This should address the bug and ensure that the scatter plot elements use the correct color, even when a single RGB or RGBA color is provided.
