Potential errors:
1. The function is missing the `cls` argument to be a static method.
2. The function is trying to access `rcParams` without importing it.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. Without the `cls` argument, the function cannot access the class variables and methods.
2. The `rcParams` module needs to be imported in order to access its attributes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add the `cls` argument to the function to make it a static method.
2. Import the `rcParams` module at the beginning of the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
import matplotlib.rcsetup as rcsetup
from matplotlib.cbook import _log

# this is the corrected function
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(cls, c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    """
    Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.
    """
    rcParams = rcsetup.defaultParams

    # remaining code stays the same
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    # remaining code stays the same
```
