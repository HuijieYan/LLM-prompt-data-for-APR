The bug occurs when the `c` argument is provided as a single RGB or RGBA color specified in a 2D array with a single row, but the scatter plot produces multiple colors instead of a single color. This happens because the function `_parse_scatter_color_args` does not handle this specific case correctly. When the shape of `c` matches the size of `x` and `y`, it should use the provided color for all points, but it fails to do so.

To fix this bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function needs to be modified to handle the scenario where the shape of `c` is a single RGB or RGBA color specified in a 2D array with a single row.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor
    
    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    
    if c.shape[0] == 1:  # Check if it's a 2D array with a single row
        c = np.repeat(c, xsize, axis=0)
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding a condition to check if `c` is a 2D array with a single row and then repeating it to match the size of `x`, we ensure that the single RGB or RGBA color is used for all points in the scatter plot as expected.
