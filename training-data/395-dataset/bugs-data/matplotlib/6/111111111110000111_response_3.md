Looking at the error message, it seems that the bug is related to the scatter plot producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input, as indicated in the GitHub issue title.

The problem seems to be in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, where the colors are being incorrectly assigned, leading to the scatter plot producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not handling the single RGB/RGBA input correctly, causing it to assign multiple colors instead of using the single input color for all points.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the single RGB/RGBA input and ensure that it is used as the color for all points in the scatter plot.

Below is the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        if facecolors is not None:
            c = np.tile(facecolors, (xsize, 1))
        else:
            c = "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode'] else get_next_color_func()

    colors = None  # use cmap, norm after collection is created
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, when `c` is None, it checks if there are `facecolors` available and, if so, it uses `np.tile` to create a 2D array with a single row containing the face color to be used for all points. If `facecolors` is not available, it falls back to using a default color.

After applying this fix, the scatter plot should correctly use the single RGB/RGBA input as the color for all points.
