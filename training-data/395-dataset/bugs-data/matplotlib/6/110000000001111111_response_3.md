The issue is occurring because the code does not handle the case where a single RGB or RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row. The function is incorrectly interpreting it as multiple colors instead of a single color for all scatter elements.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle the case where a single RGB or RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row correctly. This can be achieved by checking the shape of the input array and treating it as a single color if it meets the specified condition.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
