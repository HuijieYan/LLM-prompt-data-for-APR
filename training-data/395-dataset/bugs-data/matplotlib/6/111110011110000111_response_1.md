The error message indicates that there is a problem with the generation of the scatter plot, specifically related to the colors of the scatter points.

The potential error location within the function could be related to the handling of the 'c' argument and the determination of whether a single color should be applied to all points.

The bug occurred because the function did not correctly handle the case when a single RGB/RGBA color was passed as a 2D array with a single row for the 'c' argument input. This resulted in multiple colors being applied to the scatter plot elements, contrary to the expected outcome.

To fix the bug, the function `_parse_scatter_color_args` should be modified to correctly handle the case when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row for the 'c' argument input. This will ensure that the scatter plot elements receive the expected single color.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function ` _parse_scatter_color_args`:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    if c is not None and len(c) == 1:
        c = c[0]  # Extracting the single color from the 2D array

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the situation when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row for the 'c' argument input, ensuring that the scatter plot elements receive the expected single color.
