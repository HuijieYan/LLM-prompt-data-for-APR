The error message indicates that there is a problem with the scatter plot produced by the `test_scatter_single_color_c` function. The failure message indicates that the images generated by the test do not match the expected result, with a Root Mean Square (RMS) difference of 5.043 between the two images.

Upon inspection, it seems that the `invalid_shape_exception` function is defined twice within the `Axes` class. This is not allowed in Python, and it seems to be causing the issue in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is the redefinition of the `invalid_shape_exception` function within the `Axes` class. This causes confusion for Python, and the correct function is not being called when it is needed within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function.

To fix the bug, the `invalid_shape_exception` function should be defined only once within the `Axes` class. This function should be moved out of the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function and should be defined as a separate method within the `Axes` class. This will ensure that the correct `invalid_shape_exception` function is called when needed.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# signature of a relative function in this class
def invalid_shape_exception(csize, xsize):
    return ValueError(f"'c' argument has {csize} elements, which is inconsistent with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    """
    Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.
    Argument precedence for facecolors:
    ...
    (Remaining code remains the same)
    """
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be an color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    c_is_string_or_strings = (
        isinstance(c, str)
        or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
            and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
    ...
```

By defining the `invalid_shape_exception` function outside of the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function and within the `Axes` class, we ensure that it is only defined once and that it can be correctly called by other functions within the class.
