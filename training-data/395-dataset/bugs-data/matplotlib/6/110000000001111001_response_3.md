The potential error lies in the section of the code where the variable `colors` is being assigned a value. The error is likely occurring due to discrepancies in the array shapes and data types.

In the first two test cases, the input `kwargs['color']` is a list of lists, and the variable `colors` is assigned the result of `mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)`. This function expects either a color, a sequence of colors, or a sequence of numbers as input. However, in the first two test cases, it is receiving a list of lists, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the input to `mcolors.to_rgba_array()` is of the correct format (e.g., a color, a sequence of colors, or a sequence of numbers).

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        if facecolors is not None:
            c = facecolors
        elif rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
            c = "b"
        else:
            c = get_next_color_func()

    colors = None
    if c is not None and not c_was_none and kwcolor is None and not isinstance(c, str) and (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0 and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)):
        try:
            c = np.asanyarray(c, dtype=float)
            c = c.ravel()
            if c.size != xsize:
                raise ValueError(f"'c' argument has {c.size} elements, which is inconsistent with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")
            colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
        except (ValueError, TypeError) as err:
            raise ValueError(f"'c' argument must be a color, a sequence of colors, or a sequence of numbers, not {c}") from err
    else:
        try:
            colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
        except (ValueError, TypeError) as err:
            if "RGBA values should be within 0-1 range" in str(err):
                raise
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"'c' argument must be a color, a sequence of colors, or a sequence of numbers, not {c}") from err

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, we handle the different conditions for assigning the variable `c` and `colors` based on the input parameters. Additionally, we explicitly check the format of `c` before passing it to `mcolors.to_rgba_array()` to avoid any shape or type discrepancies.
