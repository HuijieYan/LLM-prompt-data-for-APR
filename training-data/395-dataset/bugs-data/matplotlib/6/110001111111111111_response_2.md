The bug occurs in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method, particularly when the `c` input is provided as a numpy array of shape (1,3) for RGB or (1,4) for RGBA instead of a nested list. This results in scatter elements having several different colors instead of the same color indicated by the input.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method to handle cases where the input `c` is a numpy array of shape (1,3) for RGB or (1,4) for RGBA. Instead of treating it as different colors, it should be recognized as a single color for all scatter elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor
    
    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    if isinstance(c, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(c) == 1:
        c = c[0]  # Unpack the single RGB/RGBA color

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    c_is_string_or_strings = (
        isinstance(c, str)
        or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
            and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))

    # ... (the rest of the method remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the method will correctly handle cases where the input `c` is a numpy array of shape (1,3) for RGB or (1,4) for RGBA, and will treat it as a single color for all scatter elements.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, where scatter elements produced multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input.
