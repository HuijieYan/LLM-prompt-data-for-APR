The issue seems to be related to the handling of a single RGB/RGBA input for scatter plot colors. The code currently fails to handle this correctly and results in multiple colors being produced for a single RGB/RGBA input.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for handling the input color (`c`) when it is a single RGB/RGBA color and the x/y shape is 3 or 4 respectively.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row. As a result, the scatter plot produces multiple colors instead of using the provided single color for all points.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to properly handle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row. This should involve checking for this specific case and ensuring that the provided single color is used for all points in the scatter plot.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    """
    Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.
    """
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")

    # Check for a single RGB/RGBA color provided as a 2D array with a single row
    if kwcolor is not None and c is None and len(kwcolor) == 1:
        kwcolor = kwcolor[0]  # Extract the single RGB/RGBA color

        if len(kwcolor) == 3:
            kwcolor = np.append(kwcolor, 1)  # Append alpha value 1 for RGB color

        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    # Handle other cases and return the color values
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a specific check for the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row. If this condition is met, we extract the single color and use it for both edgecolors and facecolors. This ensures that the scatter plot will use the provided single color for all points, as expected by the user.
