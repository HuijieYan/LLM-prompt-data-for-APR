The error message indicates that there is a problem with the scatter plot test case. The `scatter()` function seems to be failing while processing the color related arguments. The error message is related to comparing the expected and actual images generated by the test case.

The potential error location within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function is likely in the part of the code that handles the colors and edgecolors based on the input arguments and default settings.

The bug may be occurring because the input arguments for the colors and edgecolors are not being processed correctly, leading to unexpected behavior or output. This is causing the test case to fail, as the expected and actual images are not matching.

To fix the bug, you can revise the logic for handling the color and edgecolor arguments, ensuring that they are processed correctly according to the specified precedence and conditions.

Below is the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors) if 'facecolor' in kwargs else facecolors
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors) if 'edgecolor' in kwargs else edgecolors
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        if not mcolors.is_color_like(kwcolor):
            raise ValueError("'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color specs.")
        
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor
    
    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode'] else get_next_color_func())
    
    # rest of the function ...
```

The corrected code addresses the handling of color arguments and their precedence, as well as the conditions for setting the edgecolors and facecolors based on the input arguments and default settings. This should resolve the bug and allow the test case to run successfully.
