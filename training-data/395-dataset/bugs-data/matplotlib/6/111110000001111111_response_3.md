The issue is likely arising from the line `colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)` inside the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function. It seems that the function is not handling a 2D array with a single row correctly when converting it to RGBA colors.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly identifying cases where a 2D array with a single row is passed as the color input. This causes the function to interpret the input as multiple colors rather than a single color for all scatter elements.

To fix the bug, the function should check the shape of the input color array and properly handle the case where a 2D array with a single row is provided. It should also ensure that the output `colors` array contains the correct RGBA values for the scatter elements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# previously defined imports and code...

class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ... previously defined code ...

    @staticmethod
    def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
        facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
        facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
        edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
        kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

        if kwcolor is not None:
            if c is not None:
                raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                                 " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                                 " their functionalities overlap.")
            c = kwcolor

        if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
            edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

        c_was_none = c is None
        if c is None:
            c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
                 else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
                 else get_next_color_func())
        c_is_string_or_strings = (
            isinstance(c, str)
            or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
                and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))

        if c_was_none:
            if isinstance(c, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(c) == 1 and len(c[0]) in [3, 4]:
                c = c[0]

        # Handle the color conversion
        colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)

        return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected function, we added a check to see if the input `c` is a 2D array with a single row of length 3 or 4. If so, we extract the first row as the color input. Then the function properly converts the color input into an RGBA array and returns the correct `colors` output.

These changes should address the issue and ensure that when a single RGB/RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row, it is correctly interpreted as a single color for all scatter elements.
