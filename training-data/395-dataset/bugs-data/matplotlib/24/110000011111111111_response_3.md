The bug is likely occurring in the `setter` function within the `_make_getset_interval` method. The setter function is using recursion, repeatedly calling itself, but it should be calling the setter defined in the method closure, not itself.

The reason for the bug is that the `setter` function is using itself to make recursive calls, but it should be calling the `setter` function defined in the method closure to make the recursive calls. This is causing the setter function to run indefinitely and not return the expected result.

To fix this bug, we need to change the calls to `setter` to call the `setter` function from the method closure instead of calling itself. This can be achieved by using the closure variables to access the correct `setter` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                # Call the setter from the method closure
                setter(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax),
                       ignore=True)
            else:
                # Call the setter from the method closure
                setter(self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin),
                       ignore=True)
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
