The error in the provided test function is caused because the `ax.get_xlim()` returns the tuple in reverse order. This is due to an issue in the `getter` method of the `_make_getset_interval` function that is used for generating `get_{data,view}_interval` and `set_{data,view}_interval` implementations.

The issue with the `getter` method is that it returns the limit values in reverse order. This results in the test case failing when it checks `ax.get_xlim()` against the expected values.

To fix this bug, the `getter` method should return the limit values in the correct order. This can be achieved by simply switching the order of the limit values when retrieving them.

Here's the corrected `getter` method:

```python
def getter(self):
    # docstring inherited.
    return tuple(reversed(getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)))
```

With this correction, the `getter` method will return the limit values in the correct order, fixing the bug in the test case.

If further issues are encountered, it would be valuable to check that the logic in the `setter` method is also functioning as expected.

The corrected `_make_getset_interval` function is as follows:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return tuple(reversed(getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name))

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setter(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax),
                       ignore=True)
            else:
                setter(self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin),
                       ignore=True)
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
