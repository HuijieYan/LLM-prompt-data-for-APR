The test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` is checking if the x-axis limits are correctly set after calling the `invert_xaxis()` method and then setting the x-ticks. The error message indicates that the x-axis limits are not being set correctly, which suggests a potential issue with the `_make_getset_interval` function that handles getting and setting the interval for the x-axis.

The bug in the `_make_getset_interval` function is likely caused by the incorrect recursive calling of the `getter` and `setter` functions within the `setter` function. This recursive calling is leading to an infinite loop and incorrect interval setting.

To fix the bug, the recursive call to `getter` and `setter` functions should be replaced with the `getter` and `setter` functions defined within the `_make_getset_interval` method. This will ensure that the correct `getter` and `setter` functions are used for the interval setting, preventing the infinite loop and resolving the incorrect setting of the interval.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
