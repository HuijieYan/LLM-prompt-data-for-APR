The error is occurring in the `test_set_ticks_inverted` test function. The test is failing because the `assert ax.get_xlim() == (1, 0)` is not producing the expected result. The error message indicates that the `get_xlim` function is returning the values `(0.7, 0.3)` instead of the expected `(1, 0)`.

The issue is likely with the implementation of the `getter` and `setter` functions within the `_make_getset_interval` function. The logic in the `setter` function is causing incorrect values to be set for the limits, leading to the unexpected results in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the inversion of limits when setting new values. Additionally, the logic for calculating the new limits needs to be adjusted.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)  # Use getter to retrieve the current limits
            newmin = min(vmin, vmax) if oldmin < oldmax else max(vmin, vmax)  # Adjust the new limits based on the current orientation
            newmax = max(vmin, vmax) if oldmin < oldmax else min(vmin, vmax)  # Adjust the new limits based on the current orientation
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (newmin, newmax))  # Set the new limits
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

The corrected `setter` function now correctly handles the inversion of limits and adjusts the new limits based on the current orientation of the axis.
