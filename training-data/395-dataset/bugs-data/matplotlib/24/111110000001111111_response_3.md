The bug is likely to be caused by the `_make_getset_interval` function, which is responsible for generating getter and setter functions for intervals. The bug causes the heatmap to be truncated when using seaborn.

The issue with the original function is that the `getter` and `setter` functions call themselves recursively instead of actually calling each other. This results in a recursion error when the `setter` function is called.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function should call the `getter` function to retrieve the oldmin and oldmax values. Additionally, the conditions inside the `setter` function should be modified to correctly set the minimum and maximum values based on `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

This should fix the recursion issue and properly set the minimum and maximum values based on `vmin` and `vmax`, resolving the bug that causes the heatmap to be truncated.
