The error message from the test function is indicating that the `get_xlim()` method is returning the wrong values. The expected result is `(1, 0)`, but the actual result is `(0.7, 0.3)`.

The issue is likely related to the implementation of the `_make_getset_interval` function, which is used to generate `get_{data,view}_interval` and `set_{data,view}_interval` implementations.

The bug in the function `_make_getset_interval` is that the `setter` function is calling itself recursively rather than the intended function. This recursion occurs in the lines:
```python
oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
setter(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), ignore=True)
```
The correct approach is to call the `getter` and `setter` functions defined in the scope of the `_make_getset_interval` function instead of calling themselves recursively.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:
```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the `setter` function directly sets the attributes without calling itself recursively, and the correct getter and setter functions are returned as intended. After making these changes, the `get_xlim()` function should return the expected values, resolving the test case failure.
