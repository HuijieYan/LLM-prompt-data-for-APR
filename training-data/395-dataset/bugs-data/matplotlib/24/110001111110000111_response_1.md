The error message from the test function `test_set_ticks_inverted` indicates that the `get_xlim` method is not returning the expected values. The error message indicates that instead of returning the expected `(1, 0)`, it is returning `(0.7, 0.3)`.

The issue is likely within the `getter` function defined in the `_make_getset_interval` function. This function is responsible for returning the interval values, but it seems to have a logical error causing it to return the inverted values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for getting the interval values is incorrect. It involves a comparison of old interval values and then updating or swapping them based on certain conditions. However, the logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect interval values being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic within the `getter` function to ensure that the correct interval values are returned without any inversion.

The corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function is provided below:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(self.axes, lim_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(self.axes, lim_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(self, lim_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(self, lim_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With these corrections, the `getter` function will now return the correct interval values, resolving the bug identified in the test function.
