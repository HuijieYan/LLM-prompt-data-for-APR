The bug occurs in the `setter` function within the `_make_getset_interval` function. The issue arises from the recursive calls to `setter` and `getter`, which results in inconsistent behavior when attempting to set the limits. This inconsistency leads to the test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` failing, as the boundaries are not set properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `setter` function to ensure that the limits are appropriately set based on the given values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

This modification ensures that the limits are properly set based on the given `vmin` and `vmax` values, resolving the issue with the failing test case.

With this correction, the test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` should pass successfully.
