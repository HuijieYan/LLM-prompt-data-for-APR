Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `setter` function. When calling `getter(self)` and `setter(self)` recursively, the functions are not being accessed correctly due to incorrect usage.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The recursive calls within the `setter` function are trying to access `getter` and `setter` functions, but they are not correctly accessing them.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, you can directly call the `getter` and `setter` functions without using recursion. Additionally, the `getter` and `setter` functions should be accessed via `self` and not directly.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """
    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self, 'axes').get(lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self, 'axes').get(lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self, 'axes').get(lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self, 'axes').get(lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
