The issue is related to the `get_xlim()` method returning values that are inverted compared to the expected values. This is causing the `assert` statement to fail.

The bug is likely occurring in the `setter` method, which is intended to set the interval for the x-axis. However, it seems that the logic within the `setter` method is causing the inversion of the values.

The bug is occurring because the recursive call in the `setter` method is using `setter()` instead of `getter()` to retrieve the old minimum and maximum values. This causes a cyclic call and does not properly set the interval.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `setter` method needs to be modified to correctly retrieve the old minimum and maximum values and set the interval accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this corrected code, the getter and setter methods will work as intended, and the inversion issue in the `get_xlim()` method should be resolved.
