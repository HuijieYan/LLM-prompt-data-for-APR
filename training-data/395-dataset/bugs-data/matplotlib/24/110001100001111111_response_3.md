The issue mentioned in the bug report does not seem to be directly related to the provided function. However, based on the information provided, it seems that the bug is occurring due to improper handling of the vmin and vmax values in the setter function.

The bug in the current implementation seems to be caused by calling the setter function recursively without proper checks and conditions. This can lead to an infinite loop and incorrect setting of vmin and vmax values.

To fix the bug, we can modify the setter function to handle the vmin and vmax values properly. We can also add a check to ensure that the setter function is not called recursively.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
