The bug occurs in the `_make_getset_interval` function. The `getter` and `setter` functions are being defined inside this function, and they are meant to return the `getter` and `setter` methods for the `interval` attributes. However, the way the `getter` and `setter` functions are defined is incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the getter and setter functions are referring to themselves recursively, therefore causing an infinite loop. Additionally, the getters and setters should use `self` to refer to the instance's attributes, and the `getter` function is trying to modify the `ignore` argument provided by the `setter` function.

To fix the bug, the recursive calls should be replaced with references to the `getter` and `setter` functions within the `_make_getset_interval` function.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
        """
        Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
        ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
        """
    
        def getter_interval(self):
            # docstring inherited.
            return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)
    
        def setter_interval(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
            # docstring inherited.
            if ignore:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
            else:
                oldmin, oldmax = getter_interval(self)
                if oldmin < oldmax:
                    setter_interval(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax),
                           ignore=True)
                else:
                    setter_interval(self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin),
                           ignore=True)
            self.stale = True
    
        getter_interval.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
        setter_interval.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"
    
        return getter_interval, setter_interval
```
