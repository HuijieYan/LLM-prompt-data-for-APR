The error message from the test function indicates that the `get_xlim()` method is returning the x-axis limits as (0.7, 0.3) instead of the expected (1, 0). This suggests that there is a bug in the implementation of the `get_{data,view}_interval` and `set_{data,view}_interval` methods.

The potential error location within the `_make_getset_interval` function is in the `setter` function, where it recursively calls itself. This can lead to an infinite recursion and incorrect calculation of the `vmin` and `vmax` values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect handling of the `setter` function, where it should not be calling itself recursively to set the new limits.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `setter` function to directly set the limits without the need for recursion. Additionally, we should correct the logic for handling the `ignore` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    def getter(self):
        return getattr(getattr(self, "axes"), lim_name).bounds

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self, "axes"), lim_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            setattr(getattr(self, "axes"), lim_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

By not using recursion and directly setting the new limits, the corrected `setter` function should resolve the bug. This should result in the `get_xlim()` method returning the correct x-axis limits, resolving the assertion error in the test function.
