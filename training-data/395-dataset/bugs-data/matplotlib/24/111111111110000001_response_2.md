Potential Error:
The error seems to be related to the `get_xlim` method not returning the expected values, resulting in a failed assertion in the test case.

Reason for the Bug:
The issue is with the `_make_getset_interval` function, specifically the setter method. It looks like there is a recursion problem with the `setter` method calling itself instead of the `getter` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `setter` method calls the `getter` method to retrieve the oldmin and oldmax values. Additionally, we need to update the conditional logic to properly set the new vmin and vmax values.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
