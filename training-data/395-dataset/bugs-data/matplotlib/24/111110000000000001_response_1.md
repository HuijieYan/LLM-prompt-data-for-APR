Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the `setter` function where the `getter` function is being called recursively instead of using the `getter` function to obtain the oldmin and oldmax values.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The recursive call to `setter` within the `setter` function is causing an infinite loop, which is likely not the intended behavior. Instead, the `getter` function should be used to obtain the oldmin and oldmax values.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
Instead of calling `getter` and `setter` within the `setter` function, we should use the `getter` function to obtain the oldmin and oldmax values. Then we can use these values to calculate the new vmin and vmax values.

Corrected code:
```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_vmin = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_vmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_vmin = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_vmax = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)

            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_vmin, new_vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
