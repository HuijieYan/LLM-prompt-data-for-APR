The error message from the test function indicates that the issue is related to the `ax.get_xlim()` method, which is not returning the expected value of (1, 0). Instead, it returns (0.7, 0.3).

The potential error location is in the `_make_getset_interval` function, specifically in the `setter` method. This method is responsible for setting the limits of the axis, and it seems to be incorrectly handling the inverted axis case.

The bug occurs because the `setter` method is calling itself recursively, causing an infinite loop and not properly handling the inverted axis case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic used in the `setter` method to properly set the limits for an inverted axis. Additionally, we should refactor the logic to avoid the infinite recursive loop.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
                
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
