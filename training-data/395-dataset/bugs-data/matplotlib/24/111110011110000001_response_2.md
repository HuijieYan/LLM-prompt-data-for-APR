The error seems to be related to the inversion of the x-axis and setting the x-ticks, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values of the x-axis limits.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `setter` method of `_make_getset_interval`. The logic in the setter method seems to be incorrect, which is causing the issue with the x-axis limits.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic in the setter method does not correctly handle cases where oldmin is greater than oldmax when setting new limits.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic within the `setter` method to correctly handle cases where oldmin is greater than oldmax and ensure that the limits are correctly set based on the inverted axis.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            inverted = self.xaxis_inverted() if lim_name == 'xaxis' else self.yaxis_inverted()
            if oldmin < oldmax and not inverted:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
            elif oldmin < oldmax and inverted:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
            elif oldmin > oldmax and not inverted:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
            elif oldmin > oldmax and inverted:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))

        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
