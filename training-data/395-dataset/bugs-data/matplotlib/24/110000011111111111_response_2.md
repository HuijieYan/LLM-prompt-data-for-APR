The error in the provided code is likely caused by the incorrect implementation of the setter function inside the `_make_getset_interval` function. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect setting of the `vmin` and `vmax` values.

The error message from the test function indicates a mismatch in the returned x-axis limits after setting ticks, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the setter function should be modified to correctly handle the `vmin` and `vmax` values.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax):
        # docstring inherited.
        setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the modified setter function, the unnecessary check for `ignore` has been removed, and it directly sets the `attr_name` to `(vmin, vmax)`. This simplified version of the setter function ensures that the axis limits are correctly updated without unnecessary checks and recursive calls, which were likely causing the incorrect behavior.
