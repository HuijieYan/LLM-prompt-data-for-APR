The potential error is in the use of recursive calls to the setter function inside itself, which can lead to infinite recursion and a potential stack overflow.

The reason for the bug is that the recursive calls to the setter function are not necessary and are causing an infinite loop. The intention seems to be to call the setter function from within itself but with different arguments, which is better handled by using a while loop or conditional statements instead of recursive calls.

To fix the bug, the recursive calls to the setter function should be replaced with conditional statements to achieve the same effect without causing an infinite loop.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name,
                        (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name,
                        (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
