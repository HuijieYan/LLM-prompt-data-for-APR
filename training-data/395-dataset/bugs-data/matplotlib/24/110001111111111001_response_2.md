Analysis:
The error message indicates that the expected value for the `get_xlim` method is `(1, 0)`, but the actual value is `(0.7, 0.3)`. This inconsistency suggests that the getter and setter methods for the interval are not functioning as expected, resulting in the incorrect output of `get_xlim`.

Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to lie within the `setter` method of the `_make_getset_interval` function. The conditional statements within the `setter` method might not be correctly updating the limits.

Reasons for the Bug:
The conditional statements within the `setter` method are not handling the inverted axis scenario properly. This leads to unexpected outputs when the `get_xlim` method is called.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditional statements within the `setter` method to properly handle the inverted axis scenario.
2. Use the provided input values of `lim_name`, `attr_name`, and `method_name` to ensure the correct handling of intervals.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

The above corrected code ensures that the `setter` method correctly handles the inverted axis scenario. It updates the intervals based on the condition of the inverted axis and sets the `stale` attribute accordingly.

After applying these corrections, the `get_xlim` method should return the expected value of `(1, 0)` when tested in the provided `test_set_ticks_inverted` function.
