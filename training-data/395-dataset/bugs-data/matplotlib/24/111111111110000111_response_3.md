The issue is likely occurring in the `_make_getset_interval` helper function. The error message from the test case shows that the `assert ax.get_xlim() == (1, 0)` failed, indicating that the function `get_xlim` is returning (0.7, 0.3) instead of (1, 0).

Upon analyzing the `_make_getset_interval` function, it seems that there are issues in the implementation of the `setter` method. There are recursion issues with the `setter` method, as it calls itself inside the `ignore` condition, which leads to an infinite loop. This causes the returned values from `get_xlim` to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the recursion problem and properly update the limits based on the vmin and vmax values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this corrected code, the recursion issue is fixed and the limits are properly updated, solving the bug.
