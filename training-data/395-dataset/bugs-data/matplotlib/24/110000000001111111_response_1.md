Potential error location: The error is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `setter` function. The recursive calls and the use of `getter` are leading to an infinite loop or incorrect comparisons.

Reasons behind the bug:
The buggy function is not properly implemented to set the intervals and handle different cases correctly. The use of recursive calls within the setter function is leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the usage of `getter` within the setter function is not appropriate.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Refactor the setter function to handle setting intervals properly without the need for recursive calls.
2. Use the correct logic for setting intervals based on the `ignore` flag.

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
