The test function `test_set_ticks_inverted` is attempting to test the behavior of setting x ticks on an inverted axis and then retrieving the x-axis limits. The error message indicates that the retrieved x-axis limits are not as expected, showing a difference of 0.7 in place of 1, and 0.3 in place of 0.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `setter` method. It seems that the logic inside the `setter` method is faulty, leading to incorrect calculations and assignment of the limits.

The bug occurs because the `setter` method is recursively calling itself instead of calling the `getter` method. This results in incorrect assignments and leads to the incorrect x-axis limits observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `setter` method should call the `getter` method instead of calling itself recursively in order to retrieve the old min and max values. Additionally, the order of `vmin` and `vmax` assignment should be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                newmin, newmax = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                newmin, newmax = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (newmin, newmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
