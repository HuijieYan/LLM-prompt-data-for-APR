Based on the error message from the test function `test_set_ticks_inverted`, it seems that the `get_xlim` function is returning the values in reversed order. This indicates that there is a problem in the `_make_getset_interval` function where the order of the bounds is not being correctly handled.

The bug occurs because in the `setter` function, the existing implementation is incorrect. It swaps the values of `vmin` and `vmax` if `ignore` is False, which leads to the reversed order of the bounds.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function should directly set the values of `vmin` and `vmax` to the appropriate attributes of the object, without swapping the values or altering the original order of the bounds.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the `setter` function directly sets the values of `vmin` and `vmax` to the appropriate attributes of the object without altering the order. This will ensure that the bounds are correctly set and retrieved, resolving the bug.
