The issue with the provided function is the recursive calls to the `getter` and `setter` functions inside the `setter` function. This results in an infinite recursion and causes a "RecursionError".

To fix this bug, we can separate the logic to ensure that the functions are not recursively calling each other. Additionally, we need to use the correct method to access the `getter` function, as currently, it is trying to call `getter(self)`, which will result in an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter()
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                min_val = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                max_val = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min_val, max_val))
                self.stale = True
            else:
                max_val = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                min_val = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max_val, min_val))
                self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With these changes, the `getter` and `setter` functions are no longer calling each other recursively, and the correct approach for accessing the `getter` function is used. This should resolve the issues and prevent the "RecursionError" from occurring.
