The bug is occurring when the function tries to set the x-axis ticks with `ax.set_xticks([.3, .7])` and then check the x-axis limit with `ax.get_xlim()`.

The issue is that the bug causes the x-axis limit to be reversed, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The bug is likely occurring in the getters and setters created by the `_make_getset_interval` function. The issue appears to be related to the logic inside the setter function, where it is trying to handle ignore and recursively call the setter. It seems that the recursive calls to `setter` are causing the logic to fail, resulting in the incorrect axis limits.

To fix this bug, instead of recursively calling the `setter`, the built-in `getter` and `setter` functions for the axis limits should be used. Additionally, the logic for handling ignore should be simplified.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            getattr(self.axes, f"set_{lim_name}")(vmin, vmax)
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            getattr(self.axes, f"set_{lim_name}")(min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this corrected implementation, the bug related to the inverted axis limits should be resolved, and the test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` should pass without assertion errors.
