Potential Error Location:

The error may be occurring in the `_make_getset_interval` function, specifically in the `setter` method. The current implementation of the `setter` method is causing the issue.

Reasons behind the Bug:

The current implementation of the `setter` method seems to be recursively calling itself without making necessary changes to the `vmin` and `vmax` values. This could be resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect behavior, leading to the truncation of the heatmap.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, the recursive call should be removed, and the `vmin` and `vmax` values should be adjusted based on the `oldmin` and `oldmax` values. Additionally, the `ignore` flag should be appropriately handled to avoid entering into unnecessary conditions.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
