The error occurs when the `assert ax.get_xlim() == (1, 0)` statement fails. This means that the `get_xlim` function is not returning the expected result. 

Looking at the buggy function `_make_getset_interval`, the issue is likely with the `getter` and `setter` functions. It seems that the recursive use of `setter` to call itself with different arguments is causing the problem. 

To fix this, we should refactor the `setter` function to set the correct values directly, rather than recursively calling itself. The correct values for `vmin` and `vmax` should be compared to the current limits (`oldmin` and `oldmax`) and then set accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
