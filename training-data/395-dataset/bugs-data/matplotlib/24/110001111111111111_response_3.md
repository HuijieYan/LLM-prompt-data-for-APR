The error in this code is likely caused by the `getter` and `setter` functions. These functions seem to miss a reference to `self`. Therefore, the `getter` and `setter` methods need access to the instance variables, which can be accessed using `self`. Additionally, the `if` conditions in the `setter` method seem to be recursive, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to include `self` as an argument in the `getter` and `setter` methods. Additionally, we need to rewrite the `setter` method to avoid recursion and correctly update the attributes based on the conditionals.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name).update((min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name).update((max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With these changes, the `getter` and `setter` functions will have access to the instance variables through `self`, and the corrected logic in the `setter` method can update the attributes without recursion.
