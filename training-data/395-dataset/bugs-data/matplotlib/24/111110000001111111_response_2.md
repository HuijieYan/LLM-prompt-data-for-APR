The bug in the given function is a logical error in the `setter` method. The `setter` method recursively calls itself without making any progress towards the base case, which leads to an infinite loop.

To fix this bug, the base case for setting the interval should be added to the `setter` method. This can be achieved by checking if the oldmin is less than the oldmax and directly setting the attribute in that case. The recursive call is unnecessary and leads to the infinite loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` method:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this corrected code, the `setter` method will no longer enter into an infinite loop and will set the attribute as intended, based on the conditions provided.
