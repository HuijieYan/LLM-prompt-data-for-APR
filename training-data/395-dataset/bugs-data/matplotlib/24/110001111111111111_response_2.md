The bug occurs in the `setter` method in the `_make_getset_interval` function. The code in the `setter` function is recursively calling itself instead of the intended `setter` within the function. This leads to an incorrect comparison and inconsistent results.

To fix this bug, the code inside the `setter` function needs to be modified to call the `getter` and `setter` functions directly instead of recursively calling itself. Additionally, the conditional logic for swapping `vmin` and `vmax` based on their values should be updated to ensure the logic functions as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        current_interval = getter(self)
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            if vmin > vmax:
                vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
