I actually came across this while tidying up test branches after fixing #760.

users-MBP:thefuck user$ git checkout -b "let's"
fatal: A branch named 'let's' already exists.

This should fix #600.

When called from fish, using thefuck to correct a missing upstream branch fails if the branch name contains quotes or special characters.

Example below,

~/my-app> git push
fatal: The current branch feat/let's-do-this has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin feat/let's-do-this

~/my-app> fuck
git push --set-upstream origin feat/let's-do-this [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Unexpected end of string, quotes are not balanced
- (line 1): begin; git push --set-upstream origin feat/let's-do-this
