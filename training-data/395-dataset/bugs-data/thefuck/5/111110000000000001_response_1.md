Potential error location:
- The function is using the '@git_support' decorator which is not defined.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The '@git_support' decorator is not defined, so the function will throw an error when it is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Remove the '@git_support' decorator if it is not needed.
- Define the '@git_support' decorator if it is required for the function.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
