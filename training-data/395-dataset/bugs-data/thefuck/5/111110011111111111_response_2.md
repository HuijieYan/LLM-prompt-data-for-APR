The error in the code is likely occurring due to the condition in the function `match` not correctly identifying the presence of 'push' and 'set-upstream' in the command script and output. The condition is written as `'push' in command.script_parts` and ` 'set-upstream' in command.output`, but it doesn't account for the complete token 'feature/set-upstream' that appears in the output.

One possible approach to fixing this issue is to use a regular expression to search for the complete string 'git push' followed by any characters (representing the branch name) in the output. This would accurately capture the branch name and then check if it contains 'set-upstream'.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import re

def match(command):
    return 'git push' in command.output and re.search(r'git push \S*set-upstream', command.output) is not None
```

This corrected code uses the `re.search` function to find a match for the pattern 'git push \S*set-upstream' in the command output, where `\S*` represents any sequence of non-whitespace characters (the branch name).

With this correction, the function should now accurately identify the presence of 'push' and 'set-upstream' in the command output for the given test case and prevent the assertion error.
