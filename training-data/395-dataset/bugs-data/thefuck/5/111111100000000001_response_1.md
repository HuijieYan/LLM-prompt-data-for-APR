Potential Error Location: The bug might be in the condition checking for 'set-upstream' in the command output.

Reason for Bug: The bug is likely due to the incorrect condition checking. The current implementation does not properly check for the presence of 'set-upstream' in the command output.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to fix the condition checking to accurately check for the presence of 'set-upstream' in the command output.

Corrected Code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```
