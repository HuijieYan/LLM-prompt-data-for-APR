Potential Error Location: 
The issue seems to be with the conditions in the `match` function, specifically with the use of `command.script_parts` and `command.output`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditions `('push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output)` are not sufficient to accurately determine if the command is a git push with new upstream. It seems to be checking if `push` is in the command script parts and if `set-upstream` is in the command output, which may not be accurate for determining the git push with new upstream.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use regular expressions to accurately match the specific git push with new upstream command.
2. Check the documentation or source code for the `command` object to see if there are other attributes or properties that can be used to accurately determine the git push with new upstream.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script and 'set-upstream' in command.script)

```
