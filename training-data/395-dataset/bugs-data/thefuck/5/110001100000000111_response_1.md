Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `git_push.py` file on line 36, which is within the `get_new_command` function.

Reasons for the Bug:
The error message indicates that the list index is out of range. This means that the `re.findall` function on line 36 is not finding anything in the `command.output`, and therefore, trying to access an index that does not exist in the resulting list.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `re.findall` function is returning an empty list and handle that case.
2. Ensure that the regular expression used in `re.findall` is correctly capturing the expected output.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```
