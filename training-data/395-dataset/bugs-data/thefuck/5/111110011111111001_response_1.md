The error seems to be occurring in the `match` function, particularly in the condition `and 'set-upstream' in command.output`. The test case is expecting the result of this condition to be `False`, but the actual result is `True`.

The bug seems to be in the condition checking for 'set-upstream' in `command.output`. The input `command` contains the output related to setting up an upstream branch, so it should pass the check. However, the intention might be to check if 'set-upstream' is just a part of the output, not the string itself.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to check if 'set-upstream' is present as a distinct word in `command.output`, rather than checking for its presence as a complete string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output.split()
```
