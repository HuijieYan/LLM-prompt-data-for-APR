The test case shows that the match function is returning True when it should be returning False. This is likely due to the condition 'set-upstream' being present in the command.output even though it is not part of the 'push' command.

The potential error location within the match function is the 'set-upstream' condition that is being checked in the command output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the match function is incorrectly checking for the presence of 'set-upstream' in the command output for the 'push' command without considering the context of the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the match function to only check for 'set-upstream' in the context of the 'push' command.

Here is the corrected code for the match function:

```python
# Corrected match function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' not in command.output
```

By making this change, the match function will correctly return False if the command output contains 'set-upstream' in the context of the 'push' command, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
