The error occurs in the match function, where it checks for 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output. However, the condition is not fully met in the test case.

In the test case, the command.script_parts value is ['git', 'push', 'origin'], and the command.output contains 'remote/ Create pull request for feature/set-upstream'. However, the output does not contain the exact string 'set-upstream' as a whole word.

To fix this bug, we can modify the match function to check for the exact 'set-upstream' string in command.output, rather than just checking for its presence. Additionally, we can use regular expressions to account for variations in the output text.

Here's the corrected match function:

```python
import re

def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and re.search(r'\bset-upstream\b', command.output))  # Using regular expression to match whole word 'set-upstream'
```
