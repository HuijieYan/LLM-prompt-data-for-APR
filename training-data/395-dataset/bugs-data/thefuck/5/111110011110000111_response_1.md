Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `match` function, specifically at the line `and 'set-upstream' in command.output`.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `command.output` does not contain the exact string "set-upstream" as a separate word. Since the function is using the `in` operator to check for the presence of "set-upstream" in the `command.output`, it may result in an incorrect match.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Modify the condition to check for the presence of "set-upstream" as a whole word within the `command.output`, rather than using the `in` operator. This can be achieved using regular expressions to search for "set-upstream" as a separate word.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and re.search(r'\bset-upstream\b', command.output) is not None)
```
