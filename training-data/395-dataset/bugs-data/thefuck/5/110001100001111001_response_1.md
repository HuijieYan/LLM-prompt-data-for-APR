The buggy function is using the `command.output` attribute to check if 'set-upstream' is in it. However, the 'set-upstream' in the output is not referencing the command that the user was trying to run, but rather a message in the output text. This means that the current implementation of the function will always return False, as it's not checking the actual command that was executed.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to check the command.script_parts directly instead of the command.output. We can also remove the `git_support` decorator as it is not relevant to the issue at hand.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.script_parts
```
