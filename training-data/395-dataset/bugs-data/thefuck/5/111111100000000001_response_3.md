The potential error in the provided function is that it is missing the definition for the `git_support` decorator, which is being used but not defined in the provided code. This may lead to a NameError when trying to execute the function.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `git_support` decorator or remove it from the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function without the `git_support` decorator:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
