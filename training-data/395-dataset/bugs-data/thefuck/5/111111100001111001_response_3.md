The bug in the `match` function is that it checks for the presence of 'push' and 'set-upstream' in the `command.script_parts` and `command.output`, respectively. However, the condition should be checking for the presence of 'push' in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' in the `command.output` since these are the requirements for a successful match.

Additionally, the `@git_support` decorator seems to be missing from the snippet provided, so the corrected function will be assuming the existence of this decorator and focusing solely on fixing the logic within the `match` function.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```

With the corrected code, the function will now properly check if the command contains 'push' in its script parts and 'set-upstream' in its output, as intended.
