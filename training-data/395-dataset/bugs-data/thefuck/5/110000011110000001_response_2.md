Potential error location: The problem might be with the condition in the `match` function that checks for the presence of 'push' in the command and 'set-upstream' in the output.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The condition in the `match` function is not correctly checking the presence of 'push' in the command and 'set-upstream' in the output. It is leading to incorrect assertions in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to fix the condition in the `match` function to accurately check for 'push' in the command and 'set-upstream' in the output.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    return 'git push' in command.script and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```

In the corrected code, we are checking if 'git push' is present in the command script and 'set-upstream' is present in the command output. This should accurately identify the desired conditions for the match function.
