The error occurs because the `match` function is expecting the string 'set-upstream' to be present in the `command.output` of a git push command. However, the error message indicates that the `command.output` contains different information and the function fails to extract the required information.

The potential error location within the `match` function is in the line:
```python
return ('push' in command.script_parts
        and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```

The occurrence of the bug is due to the mismatch between the expected content of the `command.output` and the actual content. The function is trying to find 'set-upstream' in `command.output`, but it's not present there.

To fix this bug, we need to change the way the function checks for the presence of 'set-upstream'. We can modify the `match` function to look for the specific branch name that is being set up to track the remote branch from the `command.output`, instead of just searching for 'set-upstream'.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set up to track remote branch' in command.output)
```

With this modification, the `match` function will check if the command contains 'push' and if the output contains the specific string 'set up to track remote branch', which indicates that the branch is being set up to track the remote branch.

This change will handle the scenario indicated in the error message and fix the bug.
