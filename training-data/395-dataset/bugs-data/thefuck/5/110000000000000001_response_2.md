The issue with the provided code is that it uses a decorator '@git_support' which is not defined anywhere in the code. This will result in a NameError when trying to use the 'match' function.

To fix this, we can remove the undefined decorator and directly define the 'match' function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```

Removing the decorator and directly defining the 'match' function resolves the issue. Now the 'match' function can be used without any errors.
