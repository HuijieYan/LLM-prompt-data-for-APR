Potential error location: The error occurs in the `git_push.py` file at line 36, within the `get_new_command` function.

Reasons behind the bug:
The error occurs because the regular expression `re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)[0].strip()` is trying to access the first element of the list returned by `re.findall`. However, in this specific case, the regular expression does not match any part of the `command.output` string, resulting in an empty list and causing the `IndexError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the result of `re.findall` is an empty list before trying to access the first element.
2. Ensure that the regular expression matches the expected pattern in the `command.output`.
3. Handle the case where the regular expression does not match anything in the `command.output` string.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    matches = re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)
    if matches:
        arguments = matches[0].strip()
        return 'git push --set-upstream ' + arguments
    else:
        return None
```
