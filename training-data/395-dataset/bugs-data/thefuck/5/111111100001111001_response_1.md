The buggy function `match` is using the `command.output` attribute to check if 'set-upstream' is in it, which is incorrect. The 'set-upstream' is not directly available in the `command.output` attribute. Instead, 'set-upstream' should be checked within the `command.script` attribute.

The potential error is the incorrect usage of the `command.output` attribute to check for 'set-upstream'.

The bug occurred because the `command.output` attribute does not directly contain the 'set-upstream' value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for 'set-upstream' in the `command.script` attribute.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script)
```
