The error message mentioned a `list index out of range` error at line 36 in the `git_push.py` file, which indicates that the code was trying to access an element from a list that doesn't exist. This could be due to the regular expression `re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)` not finding a match and returning an empty list, causing the IndexError when trying to access the first element of the empty list.

To fix this, we can first check if the `re.findall` returned a non-empty list before trying to access its element. If it's empty, we can handle this case in a way that fits the logic of the `git_push.py` file, such as raising an error or defaulting to a different value.

Here's the corrected code for the `git_push.py` file:

```python
# corrected function
def match(command):
    push_in_script = 'push' in command.script_parts
    upstream_in_output = 'set-upstream' in command.output

    return push_in_script and upstream_in_output
```
