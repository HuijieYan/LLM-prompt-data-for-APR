The function 'match' is intended to check whether the command consists of 'push' in 'script_parts' and 'set-upstream' in 'output'. However, the current implementation is incorrect.

The bug is in the 'match' function. The current implementation does not accurately check if 'push' is in the 'script_parts' and 'set-upstream' is in the 'output' of the command. It only checks if 'push' is in the 'script_parts' and 'set-upstream' is in the 'output' as a whole string.

To fix the bug, the function should check if 'push' is in the 'script_parts' list and 'set-upstream' is in the 'output' string separately.

Here's the corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
