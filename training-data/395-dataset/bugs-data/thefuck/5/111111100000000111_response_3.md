Potential error location: The error occurs in the `git_push.py` file at line 36, where the `get_new_command` function is trying to access an index of a list that doesn't exist, causing the `IndexError`. This function is a part of the `git_push` rule.

Reasons behind the bug: The error is occurring because the regex `re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)` is not able to find a match in the `command.output`, resulting in an empty list. When the code tries to access the first element of this empty list, it results in an `IndexError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to handle the case where the regex doesn't find a match in the `command.output` to avoid the `IndexError`. This could be done by checking if the list resulting from the `re.findall` is empty before attempting to access its first element.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    output = command.output
    match_result = re.findall(r'git push (.*)', output)
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and match_result and 'set-upstream' in output
```
