Potential error location: The `match` function is not checking the `command.output` for the exact string 'set-upstream', instead it just checks if it exists in the output.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `match` function is not accurately checking if 'set-upstream' exists in the `command.output`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Update the `match` function to check if 'set-upstream' exists as a standalone word in the `command.output` rather than just checking for its presence.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output.split() and 'up' in command.output.split())
```

The above code checks if both 'set-upstream' and 'up' exist as standalone words in the `command.output`. This should accurately match the desired condition and fix the bug.
