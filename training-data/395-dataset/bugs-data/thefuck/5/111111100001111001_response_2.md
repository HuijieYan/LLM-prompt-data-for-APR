The buggy function `match` is implemented to check if the command contains 'push' and the output contains 'set-upstream'. The bug seems to be in the implementation of the `match` function, as it does not correctly check the `command.output` for 'set-upstream'.

The `match` function should correctly identify if the command is a git push and whether it sets the upstream branch. The current implementation is simplistic and does not correctly check for the 'set-upstream' action in the command output.

To fix the bug, the function `match` should be modified to correctly check for 'set-upstream' in the `command.output`. The implementation should be updated as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```

This fix will ensure that the `match` function correctly checks if the 'push' is present in the command script parts and 'set-upstream' is present in the command output.

With this fix, the `match` function will return the expected output based on the provided test case.
