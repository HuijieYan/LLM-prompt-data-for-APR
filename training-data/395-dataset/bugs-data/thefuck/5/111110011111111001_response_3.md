The bug occurs because the `match` method checks for 'set-upstream' in the `command.output` instead of checking for 'set-upstream' in the `remote` part of the `command.output`. The `match` method incorrectly matches the 'set-upstream' in the whole output, which causes it to fail even though the expected behavior is to match 'set-upstream' in the 'remote' part of the output.

To fix the bug, the `match` method needs to be updated to check for 'set-upstream' in the 'remote' part of the `command.output`. This can be achieved by splitting the `command.output` by newline characters and only checking for 'set-upstream' in the parts that start with 'remote:'.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    output_lines = command.output.split('\n')
    for line in output_lines:
        if line.startswith('remote:') and 'set-upstream' in line:
            return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly search for 'set-upstream' in the 'remote' part of the `command.output` and return `True` if it is found, and `False` otherwise. This will address the bug and make the test case pass as expected.
