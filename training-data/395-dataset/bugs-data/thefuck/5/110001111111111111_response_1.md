The test case is checking if the match function returns False when the command script has "git push origin" and the output contains "set-upstream," which it should be since the word "origin" does not match "set-upstream" in the output.

The bug is likely located in the match function's return statement, which checks if "push" is in command.script_parts and "set-upstream" is in the command.output. 

The bug occurred because the current implementation of the match function only checks if "set-upstream" is present in the command's output, without considering whether it is part of the "git push" command.

To fix this bug, the match function should be modified to check whether the command script contains "push" and "origin," and if the output contains "set-upstream." If both conditions are met, the function should return True.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script and 'origin' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
