Potential Error Location:
The `@git_support` decorator is not a standard Python decorator and is likely causing the error.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The `@git_support` decorator is not a valid Python decorator, so it is causing a syntax error.

Possible approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Remove the `@git_support` decorator and simply define the `match` function without any decorator.

Corrected Code:
```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
