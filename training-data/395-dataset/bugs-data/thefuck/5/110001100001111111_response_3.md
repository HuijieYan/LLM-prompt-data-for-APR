The buggy function 'match' is checking if the command contains 'push' and the output contains 'set-upstream'. The bug occurs because the actual command doesn't contain 'set-upstream', so the condition should be updated to check if 'set-upstream' is in the output instead of the command.

The bug occurs because the function is checking for 'set-upstream' in the command's output, but the expected condition is to check if 'set-upstream' is in the output, not the command itself.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if 'set-upstream' is in the command's output, instead of the command itself.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```
