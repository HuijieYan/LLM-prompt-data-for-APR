The test case provided expects the `match` function to return `False` when the command includes "git push" but the output includes "set-upstream". However, the function returns `True` in this case.

The potential error in the problematic function is the condition `and 'set-upstream' in command.output`, where the `in` operator checks for the presence of "set-upstream" as a substring within `command.output`. This condition is causing the function to return `True` even though "set-upstream" is a part of a URL in the `command.output` and not a separate command.

The occurrence of the bug is due to the incorrect application of the condition to check for the presence of "set-upstream" in the `command.output`. Since "set-upstream" is present as a part of a URL in the output, the condition incorrectly evaluates to `True`, causing the function to return `True`.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to check for the presence of a word "set-upstream" as a separate token in the `command.output` rather than as a substring.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Fixed function
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and any(part == 'set-upstream' for part in command.output.split()))
```
