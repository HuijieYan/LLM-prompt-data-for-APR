Potential Error location: The error occurs due to the 'git_support' decorator being incorrectly used on the 'match' function. This causes issues with the 'command' parameter and the 'output' attribute being referenced in the return statement, leading to an IndexError.

Reasons behind Bug Occurrence: The 'git_support' decorator is not being used correctly on the 'match' function. The decorator expects a command object, but the 'match' function is not designed to accept a command object as an argument.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Remove the 'git_support' decorator from the 'match' function as it is unnecessary and causing the bug.
2. Modify the 'match' function to accept a command object as an argument if the decorator is meant to be used.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
