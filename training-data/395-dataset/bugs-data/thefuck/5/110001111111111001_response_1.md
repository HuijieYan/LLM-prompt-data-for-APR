The buggy function `match` checks if the command has 'push' in its script parts and 'set-upstream' in its output. The test function tries to assert that `match` should return False when the command contains 'push' in its script parts and 'set-upstream' in its output.

The potential error is in the `match` function. It is not correctly checking if 'set-upstream' is in the command's output.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks for the presence of 'set-upstream' in the entire output string, rather than checking each line individually.

One approach to fixing the bug is to split the output into lines and then check if 'set-upstream' is present in any of the lines.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and any('set-upstream' in line for line in command.output.split('\n')))
```
