The error occurs in the `match` function, which is using a decorator `@git_support` that is not defined. The `match` function is checking for the presence of 'push' in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' in `command.output`, returning `True` if both conditions are met.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not match(Command('git push origin', output_bitbucket))` failed. This means that the `match` function is returning `True` when it should not.

The bug occurs because the `match` function incorrectly checks for 'set-upstream' in `command.output`. Although 'set-upstream' is present in the `command.output`, it is part of a URL and not a standalone command. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True`.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `match` function to accurately check for the 'set-upstream' command in the `command.script_parts` list.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script)
```
