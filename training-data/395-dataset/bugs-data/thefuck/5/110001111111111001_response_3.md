The `match` function is designed to return `True` if the command contains 'push' and 'set-upstream' in its output. However, the function is currently returning `False` when it should return `True` based on the input provided in the test case.

The potential error in the `match` function lies in the `return` statement. The current implementation checks if 'push' is in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`. However, the `command.script_parts` only contains the literal input command, and it does not include the entire output. This is why the condition fails and the function returns `False` when it should return `True`.

To fix this, we can modify the `return` statement to check if 'push' is in `command.script` (which contains the entire command input) and if 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```

With this correction, the `match` function should now yield the correct results.
