The test case is asserting that the `match` function should return `False` when called with the given `Command` object. Based on the error message, the actual return value of the `match` function when called with the given `Command` object is `True`, which causes the assertion to fail.

The potential error location within the `match` function is the condition `and 'set-upstream' in command.output`. This condition checks if the 'set-upstream' string is present in the output of the command. However, the provided command's output includes the string 'set-upstream' as part of the output message, so this condition is always true.

To fix the bug, you can modify the condition to check for the presence of 'set-upstream' as a separate word in the command's output, not as part of another word.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and any('set-upstream' == word for word in command.output.split()))
```
