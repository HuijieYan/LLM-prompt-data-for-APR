Potential error location: The buggy function is checking if 'push' is in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' is in command.output. However, it is not correctly checking for the presence of 'set-upstream' in the command.output. 

Reason for the bug: The function is incorrectly checking for the presence of 'set-upstream' in the entire command.output string, instead of parsing the string and checking for the occurrence of 'set-upstream' as a separate word.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use a more robust method to check for the presence of 'set-upstream' in the command.output. This can be achieved by splitting the command.output into separate words and then checking for the presence of 'set-upstream' as a standalone word.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and any('set-upstream' in word for word in command.output.split()))
```
