The error occurs because the `match` function is checking if 'push' is in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`. However, when the test is executed with the provided output, 'set-upstream' is not in `command.output`, so the assertion fails.

In the `match` function, the conditional to check for 'set-upstream' in `command.output` is incorrect. Instead, it should check for 'upstream' in `command.output`. 

Additionally, the `@git_support` decorator is mentioned in the code, but it is not clear what functionality it provides. It should be either defined or removed as needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'upstream' in command.output)
```
