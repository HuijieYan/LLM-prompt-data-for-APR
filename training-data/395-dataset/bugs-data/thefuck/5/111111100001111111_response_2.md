The bug seems to be in the `match` function, specifically in the `return` statement. The function currently checks if the word 'push' is in `command.script_parts` and the phrase 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`. However, the function should check if both 'push' and 'set-upstream' are present in the `command.script` and `command.output` respectively, not in separate parts of the input.

The bug occurred because the current implementation does not accurately capture the expected behavior of the function. The function should return true if a Git push is being made and a new upstream branch is being set, and false otherwise. The current implementation does not accurately capture this logic.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should check if 'push' and 'set-upstream' are present in `command.script` and `command.output` respectively, and then return the result accordingly.
The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('git push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
