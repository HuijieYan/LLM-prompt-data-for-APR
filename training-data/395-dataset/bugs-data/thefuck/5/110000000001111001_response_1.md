The bug in the provided function is that it is using the 'command.output' to check if 'set-upstream' is present, but 'command.output' does not contain the string 'set-upstream'; it only contains information about the output of the git command.

To fix this, we need to change the function to use 'command.script_parts' to check if 'set-upstream' is present.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Function with the bug fixed
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script_parts)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if both 'push' and 'set-upstream' are present in the 'command.script_parts'.
