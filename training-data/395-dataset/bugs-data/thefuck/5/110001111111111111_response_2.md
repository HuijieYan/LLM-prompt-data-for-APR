The test case `test_match_bitbucket` is expecting the `match` function to return `False` for the given command. However, the actual result is `True`, leading to an assertion error in the test.

The potential error location within the `match` function is the condition `and 'set-upstream' in command.output`. This condition is checking if the string 'set-upstream' is present in the command output, but it's not checking if it's part of the git push command.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current condition is not accurately evaluating the command and its output.

To fix the bug, the condition should check if 'set-upstream' is part of the output that follows the 'git push' command. So, the 'set-upstream' condition should be checked based on the 'git push' command's output.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (
        'push' in command.script_parts
        and 'origin' in command.script_parts
        and 'set-upstream' in command.output.lower()
    )
```

By including checks for 'push' and 'origin' in the command's script parts and checking if 'set-upstream' is in the output of the command, the corrected function will accurately determine if the conditions are met for the given git push command.
