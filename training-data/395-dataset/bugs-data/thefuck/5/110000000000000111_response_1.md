Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is a list index out of range error in the git_push.py file within the get_new_command function, specifically in the line `arguments = re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)[0].strip()`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the regular expression `re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)` did not find a match in the command output, resulting in an empty list. Accessing the first element of an empty list caused the list index out of range error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the regex findall method returns a non-empty list before accessing its first element.
2. Handle the case when the findall method does not find a match in the command output.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def git_support(fn):
    def wrapper(command):
        matches = 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
        return fn(command) if matches else None
    return wrapper
```
