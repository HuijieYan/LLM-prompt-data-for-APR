The bug in the provided function is related to the use of a decorator `@git_support`, which is not defined in the given code. This suggests that the `@git_support` decorator is missing or not implemented correctly in the code.

The error message provided in the GitHub issue indicates that the bug is related to the specific behavior of the `git_push` rule when executing the `git push` command. The `IndexError` message suggests that the list index is out of range when trying to access an element in the `re.findall` result. This indicates that the `re.findall` operation did not return any matches, causing the index out of range error.

To fix this bug, the `@git_support` decorator needs to be properly implemented to handle the behavior related to the `git_push` rule. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle the case where `re.findall` may not return any matches.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```

The `@git_support` decorator has been removed in the corrected code, as it was not defined in the provided code. It's important to ensure that the function properly handles cases where `re.findall` may not return any matches to avoid the `IndexError` issue.
