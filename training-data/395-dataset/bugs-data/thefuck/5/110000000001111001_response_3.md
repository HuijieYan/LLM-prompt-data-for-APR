Potential Error:
The function is using `command.script_parts` and `command.output` incorrectly. It should be using `command.script` and `command.output` instead.

Reason for the Bug:
The function is using the wrong attributes of the `command` object. It is trying to access `script_parts` and `output` which are not available in the `command` object. The correct attributes to access are `script` and `output`.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Replace `command.script_parts` with `command.script` and `command.output` with `command.output` in the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
