The buggy function `match` is designed to check whether the command is "push" and "set-upstream" is in the output. The error occurs because the code is trying to find "set-upstream" in the output of the git command, which is not relevant to the current command. The buggy function is not correctly identifying the relevant information and is causing an error.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to correctly identify the relevant information. The code should check if "push" is in the script parts of the command and "set-upstream" is a part of the script, not in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script)
```
