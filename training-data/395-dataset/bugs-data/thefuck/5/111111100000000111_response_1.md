The error appears to occur in the `git_push.py` file of the `thefuck` repository. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" in the `get_new_command` function on line 36. This function seems to be trying to parse the output of the `git push` command to extract relevant information, but it encountered an issue with finding the expected pattern in the output.

The bug is likely occurring because the regular expression used in the `get_new_command` function is not matching the output of the `git push` command, resulting in an empty list when attempting to extract the first match.

To fix this bug, we can modify the regular expression pattern to ensure it matches the specific output of the `git push` command. We can also add error handling to account for cases where the expected pattern is not found in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output.lower())
```

This correction modifies the condition to check if 'push' is in the `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' is in `command.output` while converting the `command.output` to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.
