The buggy function `match` is using a decorator `@git_support`, which indicates that it's a specific function for git commands. The issue seems to be with the implementation of the `match` function itself.

The `match` function is checking if the word 'push' is present in `command.script_parts` and if the phrase 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`. However, the logic inside the function seems correct, and the bug might be related to the runtime values of the input parameters.

The bug likely occurred due to the incorrect implementation of the matching condition inside the `match` function. It seems that the function should check the presence of 'push' and 'set-upstream' as separate words in the script parts and output, respectively. However, the current implementation is checking for the entire phrases 'git push' and 'set-upstream' in the script parts and output, which may lead to incorrect results.

The bug may be fixed by modifying the logic inside the `match` function to check for the individual words 'push' and 'set-upstream' in the respective input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```

By making this change, the function now correctly checks for the presence of 'push' in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' in `command.output`.
