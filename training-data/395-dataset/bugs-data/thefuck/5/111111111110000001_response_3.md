The test case is checking whether the match function returns False when the command is 'git push origin' and the output contains the string 'set-upstream'. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the match function is returning True when it should be returning False.

The potential error location within the match function is the 'and' condition in the return statement. It checks if 'push' is in the command script and if 'set-upstream' is in the command output. 

The bug is occurring because the 'and' condition in the return statement requires both 'push' in the command script and 'set-upstream' in the command output to be True for the function to return True. However, the test case expects the function to return False when 'push' is in the command script and 'set-upstream' is in the command output.

To fix the bug, we can change the 'and' condition to 'or' in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns True if either 'push' is in the command script or 'set-upstream' is in the command output.

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            or 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
