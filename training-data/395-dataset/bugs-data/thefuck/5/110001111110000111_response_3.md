The error occurs in the 'match' function of the git_push.py file. The function is intended to check if 'push' is in the command and if 'set-upstream' is in the command output. However, the test case is failing because the function is incorrectly checking for 'set-upstream' instead of 'set up to track'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'match' function is not checking for the correct substring in the command output. It should be checking for 'set up to track' instead of 'set-upstream'.

To fix the bug, the 'match' function should be modified to correctly check for 'set up to track' in the command output. 

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set up to track' in command.output)
```
