The error occurs in the `match` function, where it checks if the command string contains 'push' and the output contains 'set-upstream'. However, the 'set-upstream' mentioned in the command output is not related to the 'git push' command. Therefore, the condition is not valid.

To fix the bug, the function should only return True if the 'push' command is present in the command script parts and the 'set-upstream' is in the output of the git push command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py
from thefuck.utils import git_support

def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
