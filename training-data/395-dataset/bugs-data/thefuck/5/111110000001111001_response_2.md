The buggy function uses the `@git_support` decorator, but it is not clear what this decorator does, and it is not provided in the code. Assuming that the decorator is meant to handle git-related commands, the bug seems to be in the condition `and 'set-upstream' in command.output`.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect condition for checking the presence of 'set-upstream' in the `command.output`. The `command.output` is a multi-line string, and the current condition does not account for that. Therefore, it always returns False.

To fix this bug, we can split the `command.output` into lines and then check if 'set-upstream' exists in any of the lines.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and any('set-upstream' in line for line in command.output.split('\n')))
```

In the corrected function, we split the `command.output` into lines using `split('\n')` and then use a generator expression with `any()` to check if 'set-upstream' exists in any of the lines. This will correctly handle multi-line outputs and return the expected result.
