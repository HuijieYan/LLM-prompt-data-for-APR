The bug is occurring in the `git_push.py` file in a function called `match`. The function checks if the command contains 'push' and if 'set-upstream' is in the command's output. The error message indicates that there is an 'IndexError' because the code is trying to access a list element that does not exist.

The main reason for this bug is that the code is directly accessing the command's output and trying to extract information without handling potential edge cases, such as when the expected pattern is not found in the output.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the pattern 'git push' is in the command's script_parts before checking for 'set-upstream' in the command's output. We also need to handle the case when the pattern is not found in the output to avoid the IndexError.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if 'git push' in command.script:
        return 'set-upstream' in command.output
    return False
```
