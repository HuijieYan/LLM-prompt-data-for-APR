The buggy function is using the 'command.output' attribute to check if 'set-upstream' is in the output of the command. However, the 'command.output' contains the entire output of the command, including the remote repository information, which may not necessarily contain 'set-upstream'. 

To fix the function, we need to modify it to check if 'set-upstream' is in the 'command script' instead of 'command.output'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script)
```
