The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` method of the `git_push.py` file within the `thefuck` Python package. The error is specifically an `IndexError` due to the `re.findall` function failing to find any matches for the provided regular expression in the `command.output`, which results in an empty list and accessing the first element of the empty list causes the `IndexError`.

The reason behind the bug is that the regular expression used in `re.findall` is not matching any part of the `command.output`. This could be due to changes in the format of the output of the `git push` command, which the regular expression is not accounting for.

To fix the bug, the regular expression should be updated to correctly match the required part of the `command.output` or provide a fallback behavior in case there are no matches. Additionally, it might be beneficial to handle the case where the regular expression does not find any matches to avoid the `IndexError`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```
