Potential Error Location: The error is occurring in the 'match' function, where it checks if 'push' is in command.script_parts and if 'set-upstream' is in command.output.

Reason for the Bug: The bug is occurring because the function is checking for 'set-upstream' in the entire output string rather than checking if it's a separate command.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to modify the function to check the 'git push' command and look for 'set-upstream' as a separate command, not just as a substring in the output.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(command):
        if 'git push' in command.script and 'set-upstream' in command.script:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    return wrapper

# Test the corrected function
command = Command(script=['git', 'push', 'origin'], output='Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote:\nremote: Create pull request for feature/set-upstream:\nremote:   https://bitbucket.org/set-upstream\nremote:\nTo git@bitbucket.org:test.git\n   e5e7fbb..700d998  feature/set-upstream -> feature/set-upstream\nBranch feature/set-upstream set up to track remote branch feature/set-upstream from origin.\n')
print(match(command)) # Output should be True
```
