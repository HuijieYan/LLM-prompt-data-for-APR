The potential error in the buggy function is the logic used in the return statement. The function is checking if the 'ls' command is present in the script and also checking if 'ls -' is not present in the script. However, the logic does not cover all possible cases and is not a reliable way to check for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.

To fix the bug, we can use regular expressions to check if the command matches the pattern for 'ls -' and return True if it does not.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.match(r'^ls\s+(?!-)', command.script) is not None
```
