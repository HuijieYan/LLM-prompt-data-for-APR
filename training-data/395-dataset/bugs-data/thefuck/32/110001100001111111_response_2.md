The issue with the given function is that it tries to match the command `ls` without any options, but it doesn't match commands like `ls file.py` or `ls /opt`. 

The `match` function is designed to check if the input command is an instance of `ls -` or not. However, it fails to capture other variations like `ls file.py` or `ls /opt`.

To fix this bug, the `match` function should be modified to check if the command starts with 'ls' and not followed by a space and '-'.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

This modified function checks if the command starts with 'ls' and doesn't start with 'ls -', addressing the issue and matching the command in a more precise manner.
