Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the condition 'ls -' in command.script', which is trying to check if the command includes 'ls -'.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The current condition is checking for the presence of 'ls' in the command, but it is also checking for 'ls -' which is incorrect as it does not accurately capture the intended condition.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition to check if 'ls' is at the start of the command and not followed by a space and hyphen, to accurately capture the intended condition.
2. Use regular expressions to match the command more accurately, ensuring that it only matches 'ls' when it is not followed by a space and hyphen.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.match(r'^ls(?! -)', command.script) is not None
```
