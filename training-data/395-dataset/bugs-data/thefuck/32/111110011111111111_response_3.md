The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `match` function. The function is supposed to check if the command passed to it is the 'ls' command, but it also checks for the presence of 'ls -' in the command, which is not the intended behavior.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `match` function is incorrectly checking for the presence of 'ls -' in the command, which is not necessary for the function's purpose. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the command is 'ls -lah /opt' or 'pacman -S binutils'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to only check if the command is 'ls' without having to check for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls'
```

With this fix, the `match` function will now correctly check if the command is 'ls' without considering any additional parameters or options, as it was intended to do.
