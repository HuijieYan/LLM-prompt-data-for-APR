The `match` function is supposed to return True if the command is 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'. Looking at the expected test cases, for cases 1, 2, 3, and 5, it should return True, and for case 4 it should return False.

The bug occurs because the condition in the `match` function is checking for 'ls' in the command but not considering the possibility of additional arguments like '-lah'. The bug causes the function to return True for "ls -lah /opt" which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the condition should explicitly check that the command is exactly 'ls' without any additional arguments like '-lah'.

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls'
```
