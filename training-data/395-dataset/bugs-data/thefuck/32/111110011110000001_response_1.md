The error is occurring in the `test_match` function when trying to match the command 'pacman -S binutils'. The bug is in the `match` function. It's not correctly checking whether 'ls' is in the command's script and 'ls -' is not in the command's script. 

The bug is occurring because the conditions in the `match` function are not properly checking for the presence of 'ls' and the absence of 'ls -' in the command's script. 

To fix this bug, the `match` function should be modified to correctly check for these conditions. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script.split() and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

This will split the command's script into individual words and check if 'ls' is one of those words. Then, it checks if the script starts with 'ls -' and returns the appropriate boolean value.
