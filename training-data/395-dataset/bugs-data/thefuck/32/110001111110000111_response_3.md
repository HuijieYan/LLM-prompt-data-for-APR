The potential error in the buggy function is the condition 'not ('ls -' in command.script)'. This condition is causing the function to return True for the command 'pacman -S binutils', which is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the buggy function incorrectly identifies 'ls -' in the command 'pacman -S binutils', which leads to the incorrect behavior and test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the 'match' function to check if the command starts with 'ls' and not simply contains 'ls'. This will ensure that only commands starting with 'ls' are matched.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

With this code change, the function will correctly identify commands starting with 'ls' and exclude commands containing 'ls -'.
