The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command contains 'ls' but not 'ls -'. However, the implementation is incorrect as it is using the `command.script` directly, which is a Mock object, and also checking for 'ls' using the `in` keyword instead of checking if the command starts with 'ls'.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not correctly checking for the presence of the command 'ls' at the beginning of the `command.script` and also not excluding the cases where 'ls -' is present.

To fix this bug, modify the function to use the `startswith` method to check if the command starts with 'ls' and also ensure that 'ls -' is not present at the beginning.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
