The bug is located in the "match" function, where the function is returning 'ls' in the command script and not 'ls -' in the command script. The bug is causing the test case "assert not match(Mock(script='pacman -S binutils'), None)" to fail because it's returning True when it should be False.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the "match" function is not properly checking for the exact match of the command script. It is only checking if 'ls' is present in the script and if 'ls -' is not present, which is leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the "match" function to check for the exact match of the command script and ensure that it contains only the 'ls' command without any additional characters.

Here's the corrected code for the "match" function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

This updated implementation checks if the command script starts with 'ls ' (ls followed by a space) and does not start with 'ls -' (ls followed by a space and a hyphen), which accurately determines if the command is a simple 'ls' command without any flags.
