The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command input string contains "ls" and doesn't contain "ls -". However, the implementation is incorrect, which leads to unexpected outputs.

The bug occurs because the function checks if the script contains "ls" using 'in' operator, which means it matches any occurrence of "ls" within the command, not just the command itself. It also checks for the absence of "ls -" without considering the position of "ls -" within the script.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to properly check if the command is "ls" and not "ls -".

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    script = command.script.split()
    return script[0] == 'ls' and script[1] != '-'
```
