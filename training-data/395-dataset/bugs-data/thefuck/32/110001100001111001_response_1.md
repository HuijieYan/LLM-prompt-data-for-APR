Potential error location: The condition 'ls' in command.script is always true because it checks for the string 'ls' anywhere in the command, and not for the standalone 'ls' command.

Reason for the bug: The condition 'ls' in command.script does not accurately check if the standalone command 'ls' is present in the input.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use regular expressions to check for the standalone 'ls' command in the input string.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.search(r'\bls\b', command.script) is not None
```
