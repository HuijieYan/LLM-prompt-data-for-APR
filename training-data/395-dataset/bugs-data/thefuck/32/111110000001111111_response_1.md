The potential error in the buggy function is in the line 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script). The function is trying to check if the command script contains 'ls' but does not contain 'ls -'. 

The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the command script contains additional parameters after 'ls' or if the command script is just 'ls -'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if 'ls' is at the beginning of the command script and is followed by a space or the end of the string. This would cover cases where there are additional parameters after 'ls' or 'ls' is alone in the command script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') or command.script == 'ls'
```

This revised function checks if the command script starts with 'ls ' or if the command script is just 'ls', which covers all the possible scenarios where 'ls' command would be used.
