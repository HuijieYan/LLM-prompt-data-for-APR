The error is in the `match` function. The current implementation checks if the string 'ls' is in the command script and if the string 'ls -' is not in the command script. This will return `True` for the case where the command script is 'pacman -S binutils', which is not desired.

The bug occurs because the current implementation only checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command script and does not take into account the format of the command script.

To fix the bug, the implementation should check if the command script starts with 'ls ' and then doesn't contain a '-' after 'ls '.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```
