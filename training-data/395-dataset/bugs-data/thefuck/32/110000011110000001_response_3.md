The potential error within the 'match' function is in the condition 'not ('ls -' in command.script)'. This condition does not cover the case where 'ls -' is not at the beginning of the command.

The bug occurs because the function only checks if 'ls' is in the command script, but does not cover the case where 'ls -' occurs in the middle of the script, which is the case with 'ls -lah'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition in the 'match' function to check for the presence of 'ls -' at any position in the command script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script and not command.script.startswith('ls -'))
```

With this modification, the function will accurately check for the presence of 'ls' and not 'ls -' at any position in the command script. This should resolve the issue and make the test cases pass without any assertion errors.
