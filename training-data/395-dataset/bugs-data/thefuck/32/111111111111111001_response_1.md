The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is 'ls' but not 'ls -'. The issue lies in the conditions used to check for 'ls' and 'ls -'.

The error message from the test indicates that the case `assert not match(Mock(script='pacman -S binutils'), None)` failed, which means the function is incorrectly returning `True` for this input.

The potential error location is in the condition `return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)` in the `match` function.

The bug occurs because the condition `'ls' in command.script` checks if 'ls' is present anywhere in the command, and the condition `'ls -' in command.script` checks if 'ls -' is present anywhere in the command. This causes incorrect behavior for commands like 'ls', 'ls file.py', and 'ls /opt' where the second condition will evaluate to `True` as well, leading to the incorrect `True` being returned.

To fix this, we should modify the conditions to specifically check if the command is equal to 'ls' and is not equal to 'ls -'. This can be achieved by using equality checks `==` and `not` conditions combined with `and`.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls' and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

With this correction, the function will accurately check if the command is 'ls' but not 'ls -', and the test cases should pass without errors.
