The error occurs in the `match` function due to the implementation of the `and not` condition. When the input command is "ls -lah /opt", the function returns False, which is expected. However, when the input is "pacman -S binutils" or "lsof", the function also returns False, which is not expected.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly identifying commands that start with "ls" and do not contain a hyphen. The current implementation only checks if "ls" is present in the command and if "ls -" is not present, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the command starts with "ls", followed by either a space or the end of the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') or command.script == 'ls'
```
