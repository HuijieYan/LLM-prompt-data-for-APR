The buggy function is designed to check if the command entered is 'ls' and does not contain the pattern 'ls -'. However, the implementation is incorrect and does not match the expected behavior.

The bug occurs because the function uses the 'in' operator to check for the presence of 'ls' in the command script, but it does not correctly handle the scenarios where 'ls' could be followed by other characters or options like '-l', '-a', etc.

To fix the bug, we need to use a more robust approach to check if the command script starts with 'ls ' (followed by a space) and does not start with 'ls -'. This will accurately capture the scenarios where 'ls' is followed by other characters or options.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
