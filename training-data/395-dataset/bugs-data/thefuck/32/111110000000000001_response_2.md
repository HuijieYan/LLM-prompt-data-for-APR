The potential error in the `match` function is in the usage of `command.script`. It seems like `command.script` is being used as a variable, but it's not defined anywhere in the code provided.

It appears that the goal of the function is to check if the command contains 'ls' but not 'ls -' in it.

To fix the bug, the function should take the `command` and `settings` as arguments and check the command directly, rather than using `command.script`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command and not ('ls -' in command)
```

Now the function takes the command directly and checks if 'ls' is in it but 'ls -' is not in it.
