The issue lies within the `match` function. The function is intended to return True if the input command is 'ls' but not 'ls -', and False otherwise. However, the function is not correctly handling the case when the command is 'ls -lah /opt' or any similar command.

The function is currently returning True if 'ls' is present in the command and 'ls -' is not present, which is causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the input command exactly matches 'ls' or not. We can achieve this by splitting the command using whitespace and then checking if the first element is 'ls' and the second element does not start with '-'.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    tokens = command.script.split()
    return tokens[0] == 'ls' and (len(tokens) == 1 or not tokens[1].startswith('-'))
```

This change will correctly handle the cases when the command is 'ls -lah /opt' or similar, and the tests should pass without any issues.
