The bug in the `match` function is in the condition `'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)`. This condition checks if the string 'ls' is present in `command.script` and 'ls -' is not present in `command.script`. 

The bug occurs because the condition `'ls' in command.script` checks if 'ls' is present anywhere in the `command.script` string, and not just at the beginning.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to specifically check if 'ls' is at the beginning of `command.script`, and 'ls -' is not at the beginning.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
