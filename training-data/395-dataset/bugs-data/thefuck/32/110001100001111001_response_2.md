The buggy function is designed to check if the command contains 'ls' but does not contain 'ls -'. It seems to be incorrectly using the command.script.startswith method instead of checking for 'ls -' in the command.script directly.

The bug occurs because the function is using the startswith method to check if 'ls' is present in the command.script, but it should be checking the entire command.script for 'ls -'.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to directly check for 'ls -' in the command.script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```
