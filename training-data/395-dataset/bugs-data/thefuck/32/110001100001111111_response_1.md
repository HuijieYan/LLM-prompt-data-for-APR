The buggy function is checking if the command contains 'ls' but not 'ls -'. This means it will return True for 'ls -lah /opt', which is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking for the presence of the 'ls' command without any options or arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the command starts with 'ls' and that it does not contain a space after 'ls', indicating that it is just the 'ls' command without any options or arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and 'ls ' not in command.script
```
