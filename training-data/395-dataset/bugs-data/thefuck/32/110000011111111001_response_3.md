The error in the function is being caused by the condition `'ls -' in command.script`. This condition is checking if the string 'ls -' is present in the `command.script`. However, in the test case where the command is 'pacman -S binutils', the function is returning True because the string 'ls -' is not present in the command. This is incorrect behavior as the function should only return True if the exact command is 'ls' and not 'ls -'.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check if the command is exactly 'ls' rather than just checking if 'ls' is present in the command.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls'
```
