The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command entered is 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -' in it. However, the bug occurs because the function is checking for 'ls' in the entire `command.script` string and not just at the beginning.

The `command.script.startswith` method should be used instead of directly checking for 'ls' in the `command.script` string. Additionally, the check for 'ls -' is missing.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

The corrected function checks if the `command.script` string starts with 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -' within it. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
