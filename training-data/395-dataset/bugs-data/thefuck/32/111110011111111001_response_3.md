The issue is with the `match` function. It currently checks if the command contains 'ls' and doesn't contain 'ls -'. However, this logic is flawed as it does not cover all cases. 

The bug occurs because the `match` function incorrectly determines whether the given command is 'ls' or 'ls -'. It only checks for the exact matching strings 'ls' and 'ls -', which is not sufficient to cover all cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to correctly identify the command. This can be done by splitting the command string and checking if the first element is 'ls' followed by a space or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    command_split = command.script.split()
    return command_split[0] == 'ls' and (len(command_split) == 1 or not command.script.startswith('ls -'))
```

This code splits the command string and checks if the first element is 'ls' and if there are any arguments following it. If it only contains 'ls' without any arguments, it returns True. If it starts with 'ls -', it returns False. Otherwise, it also returns True.

This corrected code should fix the bug and the test cases should pass without any errors.
