Potential error location: The 'match' function is checking if the command "ls" is in the script and if "ls -" is not in the script. However, it should be checking for an exact match of "ls -".

Reasons behind the bug: The current implementation of the 'match' function does not accurately check for the command "ls -". It only checks for the presence of "ls" in the command script and the absence of "ls -" in the command script, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Modify the 'match' function to check for an exact match of "ls -" in the command script. This can be achieved using the '==' operator to compare the command script with "ls -" for an exact match.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls -' in command.script
```
