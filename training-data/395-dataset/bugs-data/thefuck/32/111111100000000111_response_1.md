Potential error location: The buggy function does not correctly check for the presence of the 'ls -' command in the provided input command.

Reasons behind the bug: The buggy function only checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command.script, but it fails to properly handle commands that include options such as '-lah' in the 'ls' command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Modify the function to check for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script in a more accurate manner.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
