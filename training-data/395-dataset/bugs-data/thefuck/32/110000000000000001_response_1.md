The potential error in the original function is the use of `command.script` without defining what `command` is or what it should contain.

It seems that the function is trying to check if the 'ls' command is in the input string and that 'ls -' is not in the input string.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define `command` as the input string where the 'ls' command should be checked.
2. Use the `in` keyword to check if 'ls' is present in the input string.
3. Use the `not in` keyword to check if 'ls -' is not present in the input string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:
```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command and not ('ls -' in command)
```
