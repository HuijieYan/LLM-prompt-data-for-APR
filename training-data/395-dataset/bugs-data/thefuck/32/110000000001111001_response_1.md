Potential Error Location:
The conditional statement in the buggy function is checking if 'ls' is in the command.script and if 'ls -' is not in the command.script. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy function is not correctly checking if 'ls' is the exact command in the script, as it also returns true if 'ls' is part of a larger command (e.g., 'lsof').

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use regex to check if the command is 'ls' exactly.
2. Use the split() method to split the command script and check the first element to see if it is 'ls'.
3. Use the startswith() method to check if the command script starts with 'ls '.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    # Using regular expression to match exactly 'ls'
    return re.match(r'^ls$', command.script) and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
