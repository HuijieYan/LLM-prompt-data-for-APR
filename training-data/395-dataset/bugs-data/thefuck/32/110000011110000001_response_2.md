The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition 'ls -' in command.script. The bug occurs because the 'ls -' condition is checking for an exact match in the command script, which is not what is intended.

The bug occurs because the 'ls -' condition is checking for an exact match in the command script, which is not what is intended. The condition should be checking if 'ls -' is a substring of the command script instead.

One approach for fixing the bug is to use the `in` keyword to check if 'ls -' is a substring of the command script. Additionally, we should also check if 'ls' is not just part of another command. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

This should fix the bug and make the function behave as intended. After applying this correction, the test cases should pass without any AssertionError.
