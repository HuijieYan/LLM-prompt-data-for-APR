The potential error in the current function is that it is not correctly checking for the exact match of 'ls' in the command.script and is also not excluding 'ls -' from the match.

The bug occurs because the function is using the 'in' keyword to check for substring matches, which means it will return true if 'ls' is present anywhere in the command.script. Additionally, not using the 'in' keyword to exclude 'ls -' means that it will return false even if 'ls -' is present in the command.script.

To fix the bug, we need to use the '==' operator to check for the exact match of 'ls' in the command.script, and we also need to use the 'not in' keyword to correctly exclude 'ls -' from the match.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls' and 'ls -' not in command.script
```
