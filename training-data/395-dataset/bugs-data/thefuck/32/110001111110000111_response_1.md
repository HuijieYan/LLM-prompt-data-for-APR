Potential error location in the function: 

The potential error location in the `match` function is the condition `'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)`. This condition is supposed to match the 'ls' command but not match 'ls -' command. However, the actual behavior of the function does not match this expectation, leading to the failed test case `assert not match(Mock(script='pacman -S binutils'), None)`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the condition `not ('ls -' in command.script)` is not correctly excluding the case where 'ls -' command is present.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to correctly exclude 'ls -' command. One way to achieve this is by using regular expressions to accurately match the 'ls' command and exclude the 'ls -' command.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    # Using regular expressions to accurately match 'ls' command and exclude 'ls -' command
    return re.match(r'^ls\b(?! -)', command.script) is not None
```
