The `match` function is intended to check if the command in the input contains 'ls' but not 'ls -'. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

The bug is in the matching condition used in the 'match' function. It only checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command, but it does not exclude commands that start with 'ls -'. This results in incorrect matches for commands like 'ls -lah /opt'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the 'match' function to correctly exclude commands that start with 'ls -'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

With this correction, the 'match' function will now correctly exclude commands that start with 'ls -', thereby fixing the bug.
