The buggy function `match` is supposed to return True if the command contains 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'. However, the current implementation fails to check for the exact match of the command.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation only checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command, and not the exact match with 'ls'. It also does not exclude 'ls -' from the match as intended.

To fix the bug, the function should check for an exact match with 'ls' and then exclude 'ls -' from the match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls' and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

With this correction, the function will return True only if the command is exactly 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'.
