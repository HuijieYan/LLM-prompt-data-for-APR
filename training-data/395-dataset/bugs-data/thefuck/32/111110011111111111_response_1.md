The error in the function `match` is that it is checking if the command contains 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -', but it should be checking if the command starts with 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'.

The bug occurs because the function checks if 'ls' is anywhere in the command, instead of checking if it is at the beginning of the command.

To fix the bug, the function should use the `startswith` method to check if the command starts with 'ls' and then check if it does not contain 'ls -'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```
