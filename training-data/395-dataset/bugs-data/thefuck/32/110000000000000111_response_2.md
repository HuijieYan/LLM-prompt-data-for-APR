Potential error location:
The `match` function is checking if the command contains 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'. However, the test case provided is 'pacman -S binutils' which is not related to 'ls' at all. This means that the function is not correctly checking for the expected command.

Reason behind the bug:
The current implementation of the `match` function is not accurately checking for the command that needs to be matched. It is specifically looking for 'ls' and 'ls -' which does not cover all possible commands.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `match` function to accept a list of commands to match against.
2. Use a regular expression to check for the command in the input.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    commands_to_match = ['ls', 'pacman']
    for cmd in commands_to_match:
        if re.search(r'\b' + cmd + r'\b', command.script):
            return True
    return False
```
With the corrected code, we are now checking for a list of commands and using regular expressions to match against the input command. This approach provides more flexibility and accuracy in matching the commands.
