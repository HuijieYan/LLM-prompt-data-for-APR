The issue in the `match` function is with the condition `not ('ls -' in command.script)`. This condition is trying to check if the command does not contain 'ls -' but it doesn't consider all the possible cases, resulting in incorrect behavior.

The bug occurs because the current condition `not ('ls -' in command.script)` does not consider cases where 'ls' is followed by other options or arguments. It only checks for 'ls -' but not for 'ls' followed by any other characters.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to ensure that it only matches the exact 'ls' command and not any variations or substrings.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    command_parts = command.script.split()
    return command_parts[0] == 'ls' and not any(part.startswith('-') for part in command_parts[1:])
```

With this modified function and the given test cases, it should behave as expected and pass all the assertions in the test function.
