The bug is occurring in the `match` function, where it returns `True` for a command that does not contain `ls` but also does not contain `ls -`. This means that it incorrectly matches commands that do not contain the `ls` command.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition `not ('ls -' in command.script)`. This condition is incorrectly restricting commands that contain the `ls -` substring, causing the function to return `True` for commands that should not match.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `match` function is incorrectly implemented to handle the input command. It restricts the command based on the presence of the `ls -` substring, leading to false positive matches for commands that should not match.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `match` function. We should use the `split` method to split the command into separate terms and check if the first term is equal to 'ls'. This will accurately check if the command starts with 'ls' and does not include any options, such as 'ls -'.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.split()[0] == 'ls'
```

With this change, the `match` function will correctly match commands that start with 'ls' without any options.
