The bug in the `match` function is that it returns `True` for any command that contains 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'. This results in the `assert not match(Mock(script='pacman -S binutils'), None)` failing because 'pacman -S binutils' contains 'ls', but it shouldn't match according to the function's logic.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to specifically check for the exact command 'ls' without any flags or additional options.

Here is the corrected `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls'
```

This will ensure that the `match` function only returns `True` if the command is exactly 'ls', and will return `False` for any other command with additional flags or options.
