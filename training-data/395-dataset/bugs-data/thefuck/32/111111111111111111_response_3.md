The bug occurs because the `match` function is not correctly checking for the presence of 'ls' in the command script and excluding the cases where 'ls -' is present.

The bug occurs because the 'ls' check doesn't take into account the possibility of additional parameters after 'ls' in the command script.

To fix the bug, the function should check if 'ls' is present in the command script and if it is not followed by any other characters or parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') or command.script == 'ls'
```

This fix checks if the command script starts with 'ls ' (with a space after 'ls') or if the command script is exactly 'ls', which covers all the cases mentioned in the test function.
