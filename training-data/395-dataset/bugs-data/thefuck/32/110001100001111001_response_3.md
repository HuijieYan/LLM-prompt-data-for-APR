Potential error location: The faulty line of code is the 'and' statement in the return line of the match function.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the 'and' statement in the return line is causing the function to return False if 'ls -' is found anywhere within the command.script.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the condition in the return statement to check if the command starts with 'ls' and also check to make sure it doesn't have any option flags like '-'.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not any(option in command.script for option in ['-a', '-l'])
```
