The issue lies in the `match` function. The function is intended to check if the command contains 'ls' but does not contain 'ls -'. However, the current implementation is incorrect and fails for the test case where the script is 'pacman -S binutils'.

The reason for the bug is that the `match` function simply looks for 'ls' in the entire command script and then checks if 'ls -' is not present in the command script. This logic is flawed because it does not explicitly check if 'ls' is the entire command word.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to explicitly check if 'ls' is the entire command word and also ensure that 'ls -' is not present in the script.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.split()[0] == 'ls' and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

In this corrected code, we split the command script by spaces and then check if the first word of the command is 'ls'. We also check if 'ls -' is not present in the script.

With this corrected logic, the test cases should pass successfully.
