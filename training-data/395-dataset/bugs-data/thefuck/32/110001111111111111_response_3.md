The bug is located in the `match` function. The function currently returns `True` for the input `Mock(script='pacman -S binutils')` because it only checks if 'ls' is in the command but does not check for the absence of '-ls -' in the command. This results in a false positive for the `pacman -S binutils` input.

To fix this bug, the `match` function should be modified to check if 'ls' is in the command and if '-ls -' is not in the command. This will ensure that the function returns the correct result for all input command strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not ('-ls -' in command.script)
```

With this fix, the `test_match` function should pass all test cases without any assertion errors.
