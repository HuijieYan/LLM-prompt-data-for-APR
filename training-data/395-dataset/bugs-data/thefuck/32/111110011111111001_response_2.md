The `match` function is supposed to check if the command script contains 'ls' but not 'ls -'. However, the current implementation is incorrect because it only checks if 'ls' is in the command script and 'ls -' is not in the command script, which does not satisfy the requirement.

The error message from the test function corresponds to the specific input parameter value of `Mock(script='pacman -S binutils')`. The function is returning `True` for this input, but it should be returning `False` based on the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `match` function. Instead of checking for 'ls' and 'ls -', we should use the `startswith` method to check if the command script starts with 'ls' and the next character is not a hyphen.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
