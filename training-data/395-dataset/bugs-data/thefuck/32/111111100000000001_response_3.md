The potential error in the given function is that it is not checking for the presence of '-l' or '-a' options in the ls command. The function only checks for the presence of 'ls' and absence of 'ls -' in the command.

The bug occurs because the function is only checking for the presence of 'ls' in the command and not considering the options like '-l' or '-a' which are part of the 'ls -l' or 'ls -a' commands.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the presence of '-l' or '-a' options in the 'ls' command string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -l' in command.script or 'ls -a' in command.script)
```
