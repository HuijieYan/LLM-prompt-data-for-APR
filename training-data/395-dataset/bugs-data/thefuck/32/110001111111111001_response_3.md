The issue with the buggy function `match` is that it does not handle the case where 'ls' is part of a larger command. It only checks if 'ls' is present in the command and if 'ls -' is not present, which causes the test case `assert not match(Mock(script='pacman -S binutils'), None)` to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `match` function to check if 'ls' is the first part of the command and is followed by either a space or the end of the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') or command.script == 'ls'
```

This modification ensures that the function properly checks if the command starts with 'ls' followed by a space or has 'ls' as the entire command. With this fix, the test case that was failing should now pass.
