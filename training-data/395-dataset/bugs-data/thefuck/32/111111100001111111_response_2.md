The buggy function is designed to match a command with 'ls' in it but not including 'ls -'. However, the function currently only checks for 'ls' in the command and does not exclude 'ls -'.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not properly excluding commands with 'ls -'.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to properly check for the presence of 'ls' and exclude commands that specifically start with 'ls -'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
