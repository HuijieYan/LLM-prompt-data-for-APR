The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred when trying to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list. This suggests that the index used for popping the element is out of range, which means that there is an attempt to pop an element from an empty list.

The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. However, it doesn't consider the case when the options are not present in the command.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if either of the options is present before attempting to remove them and their arguments. If the options are not present, the function should continue running without any changes to the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This modification will ensure that the function checks for the presence of the options before attempting to remove them, thus avoiding the IndexError that occurred in the original implementation.

As a side note, the `get_new_command` function should also handle cases where the `command.stderr` does not contain the necessary information to extract the desired `push_upstream` value. This should be handled as a potential edge case to make the function more robust.
