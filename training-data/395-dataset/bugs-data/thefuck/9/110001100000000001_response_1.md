Potential error location: The error could be in the calculation of `upstream_option_index` and removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `command.script_parts`.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the code is incorrectly handling the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. The code is using `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` to remove the option and its argument, but since two separate try-except blocks are used, the second try-except block will overwrite the value of `upstream_option_index` from the first block, resulting in potentially incorrect removal of the options.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a single try-except block to find both `--set-upstream` and `-u` options and their arguments to avoid overwriting the value of `upstream_option_index`.
2. Use a loop to iterate through `command.script_parts` and remove both the option and its argument if found.

Corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Account for both the option and its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Account for both the option and its argument
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
