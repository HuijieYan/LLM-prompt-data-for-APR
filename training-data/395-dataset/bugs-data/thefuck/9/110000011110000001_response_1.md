The error message indicates an IndexError in the `get_new_command` function, specifically on the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. This error occurs when trying to pop an element from a list using an index that is out of range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments from the `command.script_parts` list.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the situation where the '-u' option is not present, which causes the `upstream_option_index` to be initialized with -1. Then, when trying to remove elements from the `command.script_parts` list using this index, it causes an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the situation where the '-u' option is not present in the command, and in that case, the `upstream_option_index` should not be set to -1. Additionally, instead of removing the argument immediately after removing the option, we should remove the argument first and then remove the option.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
