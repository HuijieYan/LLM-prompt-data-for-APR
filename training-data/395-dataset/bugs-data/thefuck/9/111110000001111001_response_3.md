The potential error in the function is in the section where it tries to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where '-u' is found first. This leads to incorrect removal of the option from the command, causing unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if '-u' is found, it is removed and the index is not overwritten by '--set-upstream' if it's also present in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    else:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This updated code first checks for the presence of '-u'. If it's found, it removes it from the command. If not, it then looks for '--set-upstream' and removes it if it's present. This approach ensures that both options are handled correctly and the function should now produce the expected results.
