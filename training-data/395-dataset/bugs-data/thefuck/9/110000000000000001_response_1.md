The potential error in the code is in the try-except blocks where it tries to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.script_parts list. If both strings are not found, the upstream_option_index variable remains as -1, and the subsequent if statement will still execute, resulting in an error.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use separate if statements for '--set-upstream' and '-u' checks, and to use if-else statements to ensure that if either '--set-upstream' or '-u' is found, the associated code block is executed.

Another approach is to use a loop to iterate through both '--set-upstream' and '-u', and if either is found, it should update the upstream_option_index variable and break out of the loop.

Finally, we need to handle the case where push_upstream might not be present in command.stderr.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1

    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index]

    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.strip().startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

    # handle the case where push_upstream might not be present in command.stderr
    return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```
