The error is occurring because the code is attempting to remove the same index from the `command.script_parts` list twice, resulting in an `IndexError` when the index is out of range.

This error occurs because in the buggy function, if the first index check for `--set-upstream` does not throw a `ValueError`, then the function still proceeds to check for `-u` and overwrite the `upstream_option_index` with the new index. This causes issues when trying to remove elements from the list.

To fix this issue, the function needs to process both `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, and if found, remove both the option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# here's the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if command.script_parts[upstream_option_index + 1].startswith('-'):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options correctly and return the expected results for the given test cases.
