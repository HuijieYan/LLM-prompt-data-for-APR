The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list, and then replace the 'push' command with the actual suggested push command parsed from the `stderr` attribute of the `command` parameter. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation.

Upon analyzing the function and the provided test cases, it seems that the logic to find and remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument is not working correctly. 

The function uses the `command.script_parts` list to find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and then remove those elements from the list. However, the logic for removing the elements is incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option's argument is also removed. 

Here are the suggested corrections:
1. Find the indices of `--set-upstream` and `-u` separately, and then remove both the option and its argument if they exist.
2. After finding the actual suggested push command from the `stderr` attribute, directly replace the 'push' command with the suggested command.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find and remove the '--set-upstream' option and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the '--set-upstream' option
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove its argument
        
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the '-u' option
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove its argument
        
    # Get the suggested push command from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Replace the 'push' command with the suggested push command
    return "git " + push_upstream
```

This corrected function should handle the provided test cases properly and return the expected values. It also addresses the issues with removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list.
