The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 27 of the "get_new_command" function in the "git_push.py" file. The error occurs because the "upstream_option_index" is being used to remove elements from the "command.script_parts" list without considering potential changes that may have occurred after the initial removal.

The root cause of the bug is that the function doesn't handle the scenario where the "--set-upstream" or "-u" option is not found in the "command.script_parts" list. In such cases, the value of "upstream_option_index" retains its initial value of -1, which leads to an "IndexError" when the "pop" method is invoked on "command.script_parts".

To fix the bug, we should first check if "upstream_option_index" is not equal to -1 before attempting to remove elements from "command.script_parts". If it is not equal to -1, we can safely remove the elements. If it is equal to -1, we can skip the removal process.

Additionally, we should also consider updating the check for both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options in the command, as removing "upstream_option_index" and setting its value twice is not the intended behavior.

Below is the corrected code for the "get_new_command" function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Removing the argument as well
            break  # Exit the loop if an option is found and removed
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, we can handle both "--set-upstream" and "-u" options properly without encountering the "IndexError" and ensure that the correct new command is generated.
