Potential error location: The error could be in the try-except blocks used to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command.script_parts list.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. If the first try block successfully finds the index of '--set-upstream', the second try block for '-u' will never be executed.
2. If the first try block does not find the index of '--set-upstream', the second try block for '-u' will still execute and potentially overwrite the value of upstream_option_index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Combine the try-except blocks in a single block to handle both types of options (--set-upstream and -u).
2. Use 'if' conditions instead of try-except block to find the index of the options.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_9/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
