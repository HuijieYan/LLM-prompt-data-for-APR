The bug occurs in the `get_new_command` function, particularly in the handling of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The function is intended to remove these options and their associated arguments from the `command.script_parts` list, and then construct a new command string based on the remaining parts.

The potential error location is in the attempt to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `command.script_parts` list. The current implementation removes the option and then immediately attempts to remove the argument without considering the possibility that the argument index might be different after the first removal.

The reason for the bug is that when removing the `-u` option and its argument, the second removal is attempted at the same index as the first removal, leading to incorrect removal and command construction.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for removing the options and arguments, ensuring that the correct indices are used for removal. 

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        try:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)  # remove the option
            argument_index = option_index  # the argument index is the same as the option index
            if argument_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(argument_index)  # remove the argument
        except ValueError:
            pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, we use a loop to iterate over the options ('--set-upstream', '-u') and attempt to remove them along with their corresponding arguments. We also check if the argument index is within the bounds of the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove it.
