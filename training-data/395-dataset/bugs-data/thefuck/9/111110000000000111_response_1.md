The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function is intended to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the command and its arguments, because they are concatenated onto the command suggested by git. It then retrieves the suggested git command from the `stderr` output and replaces the old git push command with the suggested one.

The bug in the code is the incorrect handling of removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. The code currently assumes that the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` will always be -1, which is not correct. The code also mistakenly removes the option and its argument twice, which is not necessary.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument. We should also update the logic for extracting the suggested git command from the `stderr` output.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # Removing the --set-upstream or -u option and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extracting the suggested git command
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Replacing the old git push command with the suggested one
    new_command = " ".join(command.script_parts).replace('git push', f'git {push_upstream.strip()}')
    return new_command
```

This corrected code properly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument, as well as retrieves the suggested git command from the `stderr` output and replaces the old git push command with the suggested one.
