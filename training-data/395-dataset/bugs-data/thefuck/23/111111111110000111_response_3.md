The error occurs due to the incorrect use of the `shelve` module. The `shelve` module is being accessed as a dictionary, and the function is trying to update it. However, `shelve` should be opened and used as a shelf object to store persistent data.

The `with shelve.open(cache_path) as db` part of the code opens the shelf as a context manager and updates the data within the shelf based on the key-value pairs. The error occurs because the `shelve` is being used incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly open the shelf and update it with the key-value pairs.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import shelve
import tempfile
from functools import wraps

def cache(*depends_on):
    """Caches function result in a temporary file.

    Cache will be expired when the modification date of files from `depends_on`
    will be changed.

    Function wrapped in `cache` should be arguments agnostic.

    """
    def _get_mtime(name):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), name)
        try:
            return str(os.path.getmtime(path))
        except OSError:
            return '0'

    def _cache(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            if cache.disabled:
                return fn(*args, **kwargs)
    
            cache_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), '.thefuck-cache')
            key = f'{fn.__module__}.{fn.__name__}'
    
            etag = '.'.join(_get_mtime(name) for name in depends_on)
    
            with shelve.open(cache_path) as db:
                if key in db and db[key]['etag'] == etag:
                    return db[key]['value']
                else:
                    value = fn(*args, **kwargs)
                    db[key] = {'etag': etag, 'value': value}
                    return value
        return wrapper
    return _cache
```

In the corrected code:
- The `_cache` inner function takes `fn` as a parameter and returns a wrapper function.
- The `@wraps(fn)` decorator is used to update the wrapper function to look like the original `fn` function, preserving the metadata of the original function.
- The `with shelve.open(cache_path) as db` opens the shelf as a context manager to read from and write to the shelf.
- The `db` object is used to store and retrieve data based on the key-value pairs.
- The `db` object is correctly used to check for the existence of the key and update its value.
