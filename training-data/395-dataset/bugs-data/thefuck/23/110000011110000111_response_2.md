Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_cache` function where a file-based cache is implemented. The error is related to the `shelve.open(cache_path)` call suggesting that there might be a problem with opening or accessing the cache file.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug appears to be related to the incorrect use of the `shelve` module for file-based caching within the `_cache` function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the path and permissions to ensure that the cache file can be accessed properly.
2. Verify if the `shelve` module is being used correctly to store and retrieve data from the cache file.
3. Confirm the presence and consistency of the cache file and its contents.
4. Ensure that the context management for the `shelve` object is established correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import shelve
import tempfile
from decorator import decorator

def cache(*depends_on):
    """Caches function result in temporary file.

    Cache will be expired when modification date of files from `depends_on`
    will be changed.

    Function wrapped in `cache` should be arguments agnostic.

    """
    def _get_mtime(name):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), name)
        try:
            return str(os.path.getmtime(path))
        except OSError:
            return '0'

    @decorator
    def _cache(fn, *args, **kwargs):
        if cache.disabled:
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)

        cache_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), '.thefuck-cache')
        key = '{}.{}'.format(fn.__module__, repr(fn).split('at')[0])

        etag = '.'.join(_get_mtime(name) for name in depends_on)

        with shelve.open(cache_path, writeback=True) as db:  # Open the cache file using shelve
            if db.get(key, {}).get('etag') == etag:
                return db[key]['value']
            else:
                value = fn(*args, **kwargs)
                db[key] = {'etag': etag, 'value': value}
                return value
    return _cache
```

In the corrected code, the `shelve.open` function is modified to include the `writeback=True` parameter, which ensures that changes to the cache are committed to the file. Also, the `key` to retrieve the cached value is corrected to include the function's name and module.
