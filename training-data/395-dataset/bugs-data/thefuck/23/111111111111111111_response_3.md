Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring within the `_cache` function due to an AttributeError when trying to enter the shelve object.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The bug is likely occurring due to an issue with the way the shelve object is being used in the `_cache` function. The code attempts to open the cache file using `shelve.open(cache_path)`, but encounters an AttributeError when trying to enter the shelve object.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: The issue can be fixed by ensuring that the shelve object is used correctly within the `_cache` function.

```python
import os
import shelve
import tempfile
from thefuck.conf import settings

def cache(*depends_on):
    """Caches function result in a temporary file.

    Cache will be expired when modification date of files from `depends_on`
    will be changed.

    Function wrapped in `cache` should be arguments agnostic.

    """
    def _get_mtime(name):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), name)
        try:
            return str(os.path.getmtime(path))
        except OSError:
            return '0'

    def _cache(fn, *args, **kwargs):
        if settings.disabled:
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)

        cache_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), '.thefuck-cache')
        key = '{}.{}'.format(fn.__module__, repr(fn).split('at')[0])

        etag = '.'.join(_get_mtime(name) for name in depends_on)

        with shelve.open(cache_path, writeback=True) as db:
            if key in db and db[key]['etag'] == etag:
                return db[key]['value']
            else:
                value = fn(*args, **kwargs)
                db[key] = {'etag': etag, 'value': value}
                return value
    return _cache
```
In the corrected code, the `_cache` function now uses `shelve.open(cache_path, writeback=True)` to ensure that any changes made to the shelve object are persisted in the cache file. Additionally, the `settings.disabled` check has been replaced with `settings.disabled` to match the behavior of the original code.
