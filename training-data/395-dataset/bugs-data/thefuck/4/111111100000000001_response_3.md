Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the line "proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)" which is trying to get the output of the "alias" command in fish shell.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error may be occurring because the subprocess.Popen command is not getting the correct output from the fish shell. This could be due to incorrect usage of the subprocess.Popen function or incorrect arguments passed to it.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the "fish" shell is installed and accessible in the system's PATH.
2. Verify that the "alias" command works properly in the fish shell.
3. Ensure that the subprocess.Popen function is used correctly to capture the output of the "alias" command.

Corrected Code:
```python
import subprocess

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'alias'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    alias_out, _ = proc.communicate()
    alias_out = alias_out.decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
