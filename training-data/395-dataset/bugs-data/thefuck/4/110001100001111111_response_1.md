The error message indicates a "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" which suggests that the function is trying to split a string into two parts, but the string does not contain the expected separator.

The potential error location within the function is the line:
```python
name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
```

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the alias string does not contain the expected separator. This could happen if there are aliases with spaces in their names or values.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the cases where the alias string does not contain the expected separator.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import wraps

def cache(filename):
    def decorator(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # check cache file
            # if exists, load data and return
            # else call the function and store result in cache file
            pass
        return wrapper
     return decorator

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(parts) == 2:
            name, value = parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that the split operation on the alias string returns the expected number of parts. If not, the alias is skipped. This prevents the ValueError from occurring when there aren't enough values to unpack.
