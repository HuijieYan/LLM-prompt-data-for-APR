The potential error in the given function is that the function is supposed to split the alias name and value using both the space and equal sign as separators, but it only splits using the space.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to split the alias using only a space as a separator. However, in Fish shell, aliases can also be formed using an equal sign. This causes the function to incorrectly split the alias name and value.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to split the alias using both space and equal sign as separators.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_4/thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if '=' in alias:
            name, value = alias.split('=', 1)
        else:
            name, value = re.split(r'\s+', alias.replace('alias ', '', 1), 1)
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the alias contains an equal sign. If it does, we split the alias using the equal sign. If it doesn't, we use a regular expression to split the alias using a combination of one or more whitespace characters. This modification allows the function to correctly extract alias names and values, whether they are separated by a space or an equal sign.
