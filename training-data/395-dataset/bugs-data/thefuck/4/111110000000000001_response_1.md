The potential error in this code is that the cache decorator is not defined, and the usage of the @cache decorator is not standard in Python. Additionally, the use of Popen without importing the subprocess module is also a potential issue.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is trying to use a cache decorator that hasn't been defined, and the subprocess module is not imported.

To fix the bug, we should import the subprocess module and remove the @cache decorator. Instead, we can use a memoization technique to store the results of the function using a dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import subprocess

cache = {}

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    
    cache['aliases'] = aliases
    return aliases
```
