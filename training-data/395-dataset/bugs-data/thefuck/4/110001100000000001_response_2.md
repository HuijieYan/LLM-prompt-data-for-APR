Potential Error Location: The potential error is likely in the line `@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')`, as `@cache` is not a built-in Python decorator. It seems like the intention was to cache the result of the function, but it's not being done in a standard way.

Reason for the Bug: The `@cache` decorator is not a standard Python decorator, and it's unclear what it's supposed to do. Additionally, the function is calling `Popen` and using `PROC` without importing the necessary modules.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a standard Python caching mechanism such as `functools.lru_cache` for caching the result of the function.
2. Import the necessary modules like `subprocess` for using `Popen`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os
import subprocess
from functools import lru_cache

# Use lru_cache to cache the result of the function
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
