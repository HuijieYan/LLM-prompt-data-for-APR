The error occurs when the function `_get_aliases` attempts to split the `alias` string into `name` and `value` using the space character as a separator. The error message indicates that there is not enough values to unpack, meaning that some of the aliases may not follow the expected format of "alias <name> <value>", resulting in the split operation failing.

To fix this error, we should modify the splitting operation to be more robust and handle cases where the alias does not follow the expected format. We can also add error handling to catch any potential issues during the split operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias_parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(alias_parts) == 2:
            name, value = alias_parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
        else:
            # Handle the case where the alias doesn't follow the expected format
            print(f"Skipping invalid alias: {alias}")
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code:
- We split the `alias` string into `alias_parts` using the space character as a separator, and then check if the split resulted in exactly two parts.
- If the split has two parts, we assign them to `name` and `value`, and then proceed with adding the alias to the `aliases` dictionary.
- If the split has a different number of parts, we skip the invalid alias and print a message indicating that it is being skipped.

This should address the issue of not enough values to unpack while also handling cases where the aliases may not follow the expected format. The function should now be able to handle a wider range of alias formats and not fail due to unexpected input.
