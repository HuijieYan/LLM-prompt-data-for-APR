The error occurs in the `_get_aliases` function in the `fish.py` file. The error is caused by the `split` operation on the `alias` string, which does not contain a space to split into two values. This results in the `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)`.

To fix this bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that the `alias` string contains a space before performing the split operation. This will prevent the ValueError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import wraps

def cache(file):
    def decorator(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            pass
        return wrapper
    return decorator

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if ' ' in alias:  # Check if alias contains a space
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

The added `if ' ' in alias` condition ensures that the split operation will only be performed when the `alias` string contains a space. This will prevent the ValueError from occurring and ensure the function works as intended.

With this correction, the test case should pass without encountering the ValueError.
