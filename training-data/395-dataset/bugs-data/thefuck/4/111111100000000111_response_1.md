The error occurs in the function _get_aliases in the fish.py file. The error "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" indicates that the split method is not able to split the alias into two parts as expected.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the split method is not finding the delimiter ' ' (space) in the alias string as expected, which leads to only one value being returned, causing the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the alias string contains the delimiter ' ' before attempting to split it. If the delimiter is not found, we can skip that specific alias.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import wraps


def cache(location):
    def decorator(fn):
        memo = {}

        @wraps(fn)
        def wrapper(*args):
            if args not in memo:
                memo[args] = fn(*args)
            return memo[args]

        return wrapper

    return decorator


@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if ' ' in alias:  # Check if the delimiter ' ' is present in the alias string
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to verify if the delimiter ' ' is present in the alias string before attempting to split it. This prevents the ValueError from occurring when the split operation is performed on an alias string that does not contain the delimiter.
