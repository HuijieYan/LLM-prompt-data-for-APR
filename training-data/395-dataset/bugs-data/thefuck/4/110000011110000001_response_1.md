The error is occurring in the `_get_aliases` function within the `fish.py` file. Specifically, the error is due to the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` where the `split` operation is not returning enough values to unpack. This suggests that some aliases do not have a space separating the name and value, so the split operation does not work as expected.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle aliases without a space separating the name and value. We can use regex to extract the name and value of the alias, which will handle cases where there is no space between the name and value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
import re

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        match = re.match(r'^alias (\S+)(?: (.+))?$', alias)
        if match:
            name, value = match.groups()
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value if value else ''
    return aliases
```

By using the `re.match` function, we can capture both the name and value of the alias, handling cases where there is no space between the name and value. This should resolve the ValueError and ensure that the function works as expected.
