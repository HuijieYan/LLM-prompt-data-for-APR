The error occurs in the `_get_aliases` function defined in the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_4/thefuck/shells/fish.py`. The specific error is a `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)`, which occurs when trying to unpack the result of `alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` into `name` and `value`.

The reason behind this error is that the `split` function is not finding the expected delimiter in the string, and therefore it cannot split the string into two parts as expected.

To fix this bug, we should first check if there is a space in the `alias` string. If not, we can set the entire `alias` as `name`, and `value` as an empty string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_4/thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import wraps

def cache(filename):
    def _cache(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return _cache

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if ' ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
        else:
            aliases[alias] = ""
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code, an additional check has been added to verify if there is a space in the `alias` string before performing the `split` operation. If there is no space, the entire `alias` is considered as `name`, and an empty string is considered as `value`.
