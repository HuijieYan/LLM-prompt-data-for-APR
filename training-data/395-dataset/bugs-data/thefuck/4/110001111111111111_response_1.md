The error occurs in the `_get_aliases` function defined in the `fish.py` file. The error message indicates a "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" which points to the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` in the `_get_aliases` function.

The reason behind this error is that the code assumes each alias command will have a name and a value separated by a space, and tries to unpack both from the split result. However, in some cases, the alias command might not have a space or a value, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this, we need to modify the code in a way that it can handle alias commands without a space or a value. One way to do this is to check if the split operation resulted in a list with at least 2 elements, and if not, handle such cases separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        split_alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(split_alias) >= 2:  # Check if split resulted in at least 2 elements
            name, value = split_alias
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
        elif len(split_alias) == 1:  # Handle aliases without space or value
            name = split_alias[0]
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = ''
    return aliases
```

This corrected code first checks if the split operation resulted in at least 2 elements. If so, it unpacks the name and value from the split result. If the split resulted in only 1 element, it handles such cases separately by setting the value as an empty string. This modification ensures that the code can handle alias commands with or without a space or a value, and should resolve the ValueError.
