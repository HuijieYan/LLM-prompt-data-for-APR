The potential error in the provided function is the use of `Popen` without importing the necessary module `subprocess`. This could potentially cause the function to throw an error related to `Popen` being undefined or not found.

The logic of the function seems to be to retrieve aliases from the fish shell and then filter out those that are present in the `overridden` set. However, there are some issues with the above-mentioned logic and the code itself.

The code should import the `subprocess` module since it is using the `Popen` function to create a new process for the `fish` shell. 

Additionally, the logic of splitting the alias using both 'alias ' and ' ' as the delimiter to separate the alias name and value seems incorrect as it might not handle the cases where the alias has an equal sign ('=') as the delimiter. It should be using the `=` sign as the delimiter for splitting.

With these points in mind, below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def cache(filename):
    # This is a decorator function, will keep it as is for this fix
    pass

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if '=' in alias:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split('=')  # using '=' as delimiter
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the provided corrected code:
- We import the `subprocess` module to use the `Popen` function.
- We use `=` as the delimiter to split the alias into name and value.
- We handle the potential error related to the missing import of the `subprocess` module.
