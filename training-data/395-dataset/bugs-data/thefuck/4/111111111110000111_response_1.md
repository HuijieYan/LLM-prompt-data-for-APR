The error message indicates a "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" at line 25 in the file thefuck/shells/fish.py. This occurs in the _get_aliases function within the _get_aliases method. The error is due to the code expecting to split the alias into a name and value pair, but it's encountering some aliases that do not follow the expected format.

To fix this bug, one approach would be to add a check to ensure that the alias follows the expected format before attempting to split it. This check can be implemented using a conditional statement.

Below is the corrected code for the _get_aliases function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from thefuck.utils import cache

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if alias.startswith('alias '):
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to ensure that the alias starts with 'alias ' before attempting to split it. This check should prevent the ValueError caused by aliases not following the expected format.
