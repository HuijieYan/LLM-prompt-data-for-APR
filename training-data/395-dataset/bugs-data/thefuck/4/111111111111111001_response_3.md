The error occurs at the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` inside the `_get_aliases` function. This line is trying to split the alias by space and assign the two parts to `name` and `value` variables.

The error message "ValueError: not enough values to unpack" suggests that the `split` operation did not result in two values as expected.

The reason for this error is that some aliases contain spaces within their values. When the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` is executed, it only finds one space and tries to split the alias based on that, leading to fewer variables than expected in the unpacking.

To fix this bug, we need to split the alias only on the first occurrence of a space. We can do this by specifying `maxsplit=1` as an argument to the `split` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

With this fix, the `split` operation will only split the alias at the first occurrence of a space, ensuring that `name` and `value` always receive the correct number of values.
