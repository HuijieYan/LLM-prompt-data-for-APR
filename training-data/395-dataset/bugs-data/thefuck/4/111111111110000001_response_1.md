Potential Error Location: The error occurs in the `_get_aliases` function at line 7 when trying to split the alias into `name` and `value`.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The error message indicates that there are not enough values to unpack because some alias lines might not contain a space character after the 'alias' keyword, resulting in the failure of the split operation.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the split operation succeeds before extracting `name` and `value`.
2. Handle cases where the split operation fails by skipping those aliases or using a default value for `value`.
3. Ensure that the alias lines are properly formatted before attempting to split them.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
        if ' ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

This corrected code first removes the 'alias ' prefix from each alias line. Then, it checks if there's a space in the alias line before attempting to split it. If the split operation succeeds, it extracts `name` and `value` and adds them to the `aliases` dictionary. If the split operation fails (due to absence of a space), that alias is skipped.
