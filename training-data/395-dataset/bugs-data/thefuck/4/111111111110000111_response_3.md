The error is occurring in the `_get_aliases` function in the `thefuck/shells/fish.py` file. The specific line causing the error is the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that some of the alias outputs fetched from the `fish` shell do not contain a space character after the alias name, resulting in the `split` function not being able to create a tuple of (name, value). This leads to the "ValueError: not enough values to unpack" error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the splitting logic to handle cases where the alias has no space character after the alias name. In such cases, the whole alias should be considered as the name, and an empty string should be used as the value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_4/thefuck/shells/fish.py

# Corrected _get_aliases function
@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
        if ' ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.split(' ', 1)
        else:
            name = alias
            value = ''
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
In the corrected code, we first check if there's a space in the alias. If there is, we split it into name and value. If not, we assign the whole alias as the name and an empty string as the value. This approach handles the cases where the alias output does not conform to the expected format and prevents the "ValueError: not enough values to unpack" error.

With this fix, the _get_aliases function should now work correctly without throwing any ValueError, and the associated test function should also pass without any errors.
