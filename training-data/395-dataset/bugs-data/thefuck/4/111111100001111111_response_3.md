Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the `_get_aliases` function while trying to split the alias into name and value. The current code assumes that the alias is always separated by a space, but in the case of `alias_with_equal_sign=echo`, the separator is '=', causing the `split` method to return a list with only one item, resulting in the "ValueError: not enough values to unpack" error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_get_aliases` function does not handle cases where the separator between the alias name and value is not a space.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use a regular expression to split the alias into name and value, allowing for different separators, such as space or '='.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_4/thefuck/shells/fish.py

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        match = re.match(r'alias (\w+)(\s*=\S*)', alias)
        if match:
            name, value = match.groups()
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
