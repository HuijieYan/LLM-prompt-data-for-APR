The error occurs when the `split` method is called on the `alias` string. It appears that there are cases in the `alias_out` string where the split operation won't yield exactly two parts, leading to the "ValueError: not enough values to unpack" error.

To fix this issue, we can modify the split operation and provide a default value in case it doesn't split into exactly two parts. The split operation can be modified as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(parts) == 2:
            name, value = parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

By checking the length of `parts` after the split operation, we can ensure that the `ValueError` won't occur, as a default value will be assigned in case of an incomplete split.
