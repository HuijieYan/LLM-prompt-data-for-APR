# Analysis
The error message indicates a "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)". This generally occurs when trying to unpack a sequence with fewer items than expected.

# Error location
The error occurs in the `_get_aliases` function, specifically in this line:
```python
name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
```
This line is attempting to split the alias into a name and value, but the issue is that the alias doesn't have a value to split.

# Reasons behind the bug
The split is being performed based on the assumption that every alias has a name and a value separated by a space. However, there might be cases where aliases have no values, leading to the ValueError.

# Possible approaches
One possible approach to fixing this bug is to check if there is a valid value to split before attempting the split operation. This can be achieved by splitting only if the alias contains the 'alias' prefix.

# Corrected code
```python
import shlex

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        split_alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(split_alias) == 2:
            name, value = split_alias
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = shlex.split(value)
        else:
            name = split_alias[0]
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = ''
    return aliases
```
In the corrected code, the alias is split only if it contains the 'alias' prefix. If the split results in 2 parts, then the name and value are extracted. If there is only 1 part, then only the name is extracted. This ensures that aliases with no values are handled correctly. Additionally, the value is split using shlex to handle cases where there might be spaces within the alias value.
