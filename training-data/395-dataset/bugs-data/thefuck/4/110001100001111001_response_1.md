Potential Error Location: The error could be occurring in the for loop where the alias is being split and processed.

Reasons for the Bug: The error is likely due to the split function not working as intended when splitting the alias into name and value. This could be due to incorrect use of the split function or the presence of unexpected characters in the alias string.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check the format of the alias string and ensure it matches the expected format before attempting to split it.
2. Use regular expressions to extract the alias name and value from the string.
3. Handle any unexpected characters or edge cases that may be causing issues with the split function.

Corrected Code:
```python
from functools import lru_cache
import subprocess

# corrected function
@lru_cache
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias_parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(alias_parts) == 2:
            name, value = alias_parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
