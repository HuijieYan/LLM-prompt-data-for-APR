Potential error location: 
The bug is likely occurring within the `_get_aliases` function in the `thefuck/shells/fish.py` file. The error message indicates a "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" when trying to split the alias into name and value.

Reasons behind the bug:
The function is trying to split the alias into name and value using the space as a delimiter, but not all aliases have a space in their definition. This causes the ValueError because the split operation does not find a space to separate the name and value.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix this bug is to handle aliases without spaces differently. We can check if the split operation was successful and if not, assume the whole alias as the name and set the value to an empty string.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_4/thefuck/shells/fish.py
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if 'alias ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
        else:
            name = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
            aliases[name] = ''
    return aliases
```
