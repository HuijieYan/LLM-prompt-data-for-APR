The error occurs in the `_get_aliases` function in the fish.py file. It seems that the code is trying to split the alias into name and value by using the space as a separator. However, in this case, there might be aliases without a space, resulting in a "ValueError: not enough values to unpack" error.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to check whether the alias has a space before splitting it. If not, we can assign the entire alias as the name and an empty string as the value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from thefuck.shells import shells
from thefuck.utils import cache

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias_parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(alias_parts) == 2:
            name, value = alias_parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
        else:
            name = alias_parts[0]
            value = ''
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

With this modification, the code will handle both cases where the alias has a space and where it doesn't, thus preventing the "ValueError" from occurring.
