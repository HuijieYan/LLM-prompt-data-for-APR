The error occurs in the `_get_aliases` function when trying to unpack the `name` and `value` from the `alias` string. The error message indicates that there is not enough values to unpack, meaning that the `split(' ', 1)` operation does not result in two items (name and value) as expected.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `split` operation does not work as intended because the alias command output format might be different than expected.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle cases where the split operation does not result in two values, or to use a different approach to extract the alias name and value from the alias command output.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import wraps

def cache(file_path):
    def decorator(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(parts) == 2:
            name, value = parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

This corrected code handles the case where the split operation results in less than two parts by checking the length of the split result. If there are exactly two parts, it proceeds to assign them to `name` and `value`. If not, it does not attempt to assign them and skips to the next alias.
