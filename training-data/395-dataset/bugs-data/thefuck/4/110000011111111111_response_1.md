The test case is trying to call the `get_aliases` method of the `shell` object and compare the result with an expected dictionary of aliases. The error message indicates that the issue is occurring within the `_get_aliases` function, specifically at the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `alias_out` list does not contain any string that matches the expected format for splitting into `name` and `value` using the `split` function.

To fix this bug, we can:
1. Check the format of the strings in `alias_out` and handle cases where the expected format is not found.
2. Add error handling for cases where the split operation does not produce the expected result.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if 'alias' in alias:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the string contains 'alias' before attempting the split operation. This would prevent the ValueError from occurring when the format doesn't match the expected pattern. Additionally, we only attempt to split the string if 'alias' is present, reducing the chances of the ValueError occurring.
