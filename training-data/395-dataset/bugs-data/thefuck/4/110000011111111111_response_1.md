The test case provided is testing the `get_aliases` method of the `Fish` class. This method is supposed to return a dictionary of aliases, with keys as the alias names and values as the corresponding commands. The error message indicates that there is a problem with unpacking the values of the alias in the `_get_aliases` function.

The error occurs when trying to split the value of the `alias` using the space as a separator. The error message "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" indicates that for some `alias` entries, there is no space-separated value after removing the initial 'alias ' string.

To fix this bug, you can modify the code to handle cases where the split results in less than 2 values. If there is only one value after removing 'alias ', the entire value can be considered as the name of the alias, with an empty string as its value.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
        if ' ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.split(' ', 1)
        else:
            name, value = alias, ''
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

With this modification, the function will be able to handle cases where there is no space-separated value after removing 'alias '. If there is no space, it will consider the entire value as the name of the alias and assign an empty string as its value.
