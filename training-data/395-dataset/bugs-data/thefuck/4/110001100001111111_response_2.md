The error occurs in the _get_aliases function, specifically in the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)`. The error message indicates that there are not enough values to unpack, meaning that the split operation does not result in two separate values.

The reason behind the bug is that in the input 'alias_with_equal_sign=echo', there is no space separating the alias name and value. Therefore, the split operation only returns a single value, leading to the "not enough values to unpack" error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the handling of aliases where there is no space separating the alias name and value. We can use a different approach for splitting the alias line into name and value. One possible approach is to find the index of the first space character and use that index to split the alias line into name and value.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_aliases function:

```python
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen, DEVNULL
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
        if '=' in alias:
            name, value = alias.split('=', 1)
        else:
            name, value = alias.split(' ', 1)
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if there is an equal sign in the alias line. If there is, we split the line using '=', otherwise, we split the line using the first space character. This approach ensures that the alias line is correctly split into name and value, resolving the "not enough values to unpack" error.
