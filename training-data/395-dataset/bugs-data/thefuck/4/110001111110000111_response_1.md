The error message indicates a ValueError at line 25 in the /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_4/thefuck/shells/fish.py file, in the _get_aliases function. The error is caused by the line "name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)" trying to unpack values when there is only one value in the split result.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the split operation at line 25 is expecting to return two values (name and value) based on the assumption that the aliases are defined in a specific format which includes a space-separated name and value. However, when an alias is defined differently, this assumption breaks, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle aliases that do not follow the expected format. We can check the length of the split result and only assign name and value if there are two elements in the result. Otherwise, we can skip that alias.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        split_alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(split_alias) == 2:
            name, value = split_alias
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

This corrected code checks the length of the split result before attempting to unpack it, which prevents the ValueError when encountering aliases that do not follow the expected format.
