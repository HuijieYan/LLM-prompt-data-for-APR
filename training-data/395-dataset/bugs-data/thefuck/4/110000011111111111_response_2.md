The error message indicates that there is a "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" in the `_get_aliases` function at line 25. This error occurs when trying to unpack the result of the split operation, but the split doesn't result in the expected number of elements.

The reason behind this bug is that the `alias` string doesn't always contain a space after 'alias' command. For example, the line `'alias alias_with_equal_sign=echo'` doesn't have a space after 'alias', leading to the ValueError while trying to split the string at the first space.

A possible approach for fixing this bug is to modify the split operation to handle cases where there is no space after 'alias' command. This can be achieved by using the `str.partition` method, which will always return three elements - the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from pathlib import Path

def cache(*args, **kwargs):
    def inner(fn):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return inner

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        name, _, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).partition(' ')
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code, the `partition` method is used to split the alias string into three parts - the part before the space (or equals sign), the space (or equals sign) itself, and the part after the space (or equals sign). This ensures that the code doesn't raise a ValueError when splitting the alias string.
