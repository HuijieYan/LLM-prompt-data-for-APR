The potential error in the provided code is that the `split` operation is splitting on both spaces and equals signs, leading to an incorrect split for aliases with equal signs.

The reason for the bug is that the `split` operation is splitting on both spaces and equals signs, leading to incorrect splitting for aliases with equal signs. Thus, the 'invalid_alias' is not being evaluated correctly.

To fix this bug, we should split the alias string based on spaces only. We should also handle aliases with equal signs separately to ensure the correct split.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# this is the corrected function
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if '=' in alias:
            name, value = alias.split('=', 1)
        else:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
