The bug is likely occurring in the `_get_aliases` function defined in the provided Python code. The specific error message "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" implies that there is an issue with unpacking the alias into name and value in the loop.

The reason behind this bug could be that some of the aliases might not follow the expected format of 'alias <name> <value>'. It is possible that some aliases do not have a space separating the name and value, and therefore cannot be split into two parts using the space as a delimiter.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle the cases where an alias does not contain a space-separated name and value. We can use the `str.split` method with a maximum of 1 split to ensure that if there are multiple parts separated by spaces, only the first space is used as a delimiter.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import lru_cache
from pathlib import Path

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        name = parts[0]
        value = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases

cache = lru_cache(maxsize=None)

# Path for caching aliases
cache_path = Path('~/.config/fish/config.fish').expanduser()

# correct usage of cache
@cache(cache_path)
def get_aliases(overridden):
    return _get_aliases(overridden)
```
