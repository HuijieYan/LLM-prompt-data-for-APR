The error message indicates that the ValueError occurred in the `_get_aliases` function in the `fish.py` file. The specific line causing the error is `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)`. This error arises from the fact that the `alias` string does not contain the expected number of values to unpack.

This error occurs because the `split` function does not find the expected delimiter (' ') in the string, which means that the `alias` string does not contain a space. This could be due to an unexpected format of the alias, possibly because the alias command output format has changed or contains unexpected characters.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to handle the case where the expected delimiter is not found. We can add a check to ensure that the split operation results in a list with at least two items before attempting to unpack them.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import lru_cache
import os

def cache(path):
    def decorator(fn):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            if not os.path.exists(path):
                return fn(*args, **kwargs)
            with open(path, 'r') as f:
                return f.read()
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias_parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(alias_parts) == 2:
            name, value = alias_parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we use the `len` function to check if the split operation results in a list with at least two items (`len(alias_parts) == 2`), and then unpack the values accordingly. This will prevent the ValueError from occurring if the expected delimiter is not found in the alias string.
