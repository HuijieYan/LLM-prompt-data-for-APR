The error occurs due to the unpacking issue within the `_get_aliases` function. The line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` is causing a `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)`.

This error indicates that the split operation on the alias does not result in two distinct values, leading to the inability to assign them to `name` and `value`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the cases where the split operation does not yield two distinct values. This can be achieved by checking the length of the split result before attempting to unpack it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
        split_alias = alias.split(' ')
        if len(split_alias) > 1:
            aliases[split_alias[0]] = split_alias[1]
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code:
- We split the alias and then check if the length of the split result is greater than 1.
- If it is, we assign the first part of the split (name) to `split_alias[0]` and the second part (value) to `split_alias[1]` in the `aliases` dictionary.
- This will prevent the ValueError from occurring and ensure that all valid aliases are correctly extracted and returned.
