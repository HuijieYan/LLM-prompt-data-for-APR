The error is occurring in the `match` function. The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. This suggests that the `command.script` does not have an element at index 1, leading to the index out of range error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line where the comparison `command.script.split()[1]` is made. This line assumes that the `command.script` contains at least two elements when split by whitespace, but this assumption may not always be true.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `command.script.split()` may not have enough elements to access index 1. This can happen if the `command.script` does not contain any whitespace, or if it contains only one word.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `command.script` contains at least two elements before accessing index 1 of the split result. We can also add checks to ensure that 'stash' is a part of the command and 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_21/thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()  # Split the script into parts
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
