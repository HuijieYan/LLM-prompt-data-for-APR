The error is occurring because the code is trying to access the second element of the split command.script, but in the provided input the script is just 'git' which doesn't have a second element.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the split command.script has more than 1 element before trying to access the second element. If not, we can return False. Otherwise, we can proceed to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the command.stderr.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
