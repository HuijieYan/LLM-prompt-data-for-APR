The error message indicates that there is an IndexError occurring in the `match` function at line 8 of the file `git_fix_stash.py`. The error is happening because the `command.script.split()` is trying to access an index that does not exist, leading to the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This is where the index out of range error is occurring.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is assuming that `command.script` has at least two elements after splitting, but in some cases, it does not. This assumption leads to the index out of range error.

To fix this bug, we can perform a check to ensure that the split command has at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected code, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in the `script_parts` variable. Then we check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. This way, we avoid the index out of range error.
