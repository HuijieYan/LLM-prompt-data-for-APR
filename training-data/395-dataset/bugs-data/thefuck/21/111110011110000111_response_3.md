The test case provided is trying to assert that the `match` function returns False when the command is "git" and the stderr includes information about git stash.

The error message indicates that the index is out of range in the `match` function, specifically at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. This means that `command.script.split()` does not have a second element, which causes the IndexError.

The reason for this bug is that the `match` function assumes that `command.script` will always contain a string with at least two parts when split by whitespace. However, when the command is simply "git" without any additional arguments, `command.script` will only contain one element after splitting.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `match` function to first check if the length of `command.script.split()` is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element.

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of `script_parts` before accessing the second element, we can avoid the IndexError when the command is simply "git". This correction will ensure that the function works as intended for both cases and does not raise an error.
