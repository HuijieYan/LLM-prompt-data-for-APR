The buggy function `match` is using `command.script.split()[1]` to check if the second word in the `command.script` is 'stash'. However, in the provided runtime values for the input parameters, we can see that `command.script` is only 'git' which means the split will not produce a second index element. This causes the `IndexError: list index out of range` error in the provided test.

To fix the bug, we can first ensure that the `command.script` has at least two parts before attempting to access the second part.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the `command.script` and checking its length before accessing the second part, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This will also ensure that the code behaves as expected in cases where the `command.script` may not have multiple words.
