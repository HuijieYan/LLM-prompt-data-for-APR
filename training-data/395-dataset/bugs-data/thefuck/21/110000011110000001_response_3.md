Potential error location:
The error occurs at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` because the `command.script.split()` statement does not contain any error handling for cases where the split operation does not result in a list with at least 2 elements.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements (separated by spaces), which is not always the case. When `command.script` does not contain a second element, the `IndexError` is raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add error handling to check if the split result contains at least 2 elements before accessing the second element.
2. Check if the `command.script` contains the 'stash' keyword before performing the split operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Correction to the buggy function
def git_support(fn):
    def wrapped(command):
        if 'stash' in command.script and 'usage:' in command.stderr:
            return fn(command)
    return wrapped

# Test function for the corrected function
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```
