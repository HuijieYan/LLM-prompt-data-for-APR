The error message indicates that the 'IndexError: list index out of range' occurred in the line 'return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)'. This suggests that the split function might not be able to split the command.script properly.

The buggy function 'match' is supposed to check if the command script contains 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. The error occurred because the split function was expecting a specific format of the command script, and it didn't find it.

To fix the bug, we need to first make sure that the command.script is split properly and then check for the required conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
# corrected match function
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
                and command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected code, before checking the command script for 'stash', we first ensure that it contains at least two elements (since we are splitting it by space). If it does, then we check if the first element is 'git' and the second element is 'stash', and also if 'usage:' is in the command stderr. If the command script doesn't contain at least two elements, we return False. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
