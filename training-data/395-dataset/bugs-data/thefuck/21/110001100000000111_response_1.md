The bug occurs in the `match` function within the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function is intended to check if the second word in the command is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

The error message indicates that there is a "list index out of range" in the `match` function, specifically when attempting to access the second element of the list obtained from splitting the command script.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not account for cases where the command script might not contain a second word, causing an IndexError when attempting to access it.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the command.script contains at least 2 words before trying to access the second word.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and
            script_words[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected code, we first split the command script into words and store the result in `script_words`. Then, we check if `script_words` has at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second word. If both conditions are met, the function will return True if the second word is 'stash' and 'usage:' is in the command's stderr, otherwise it will return False.
