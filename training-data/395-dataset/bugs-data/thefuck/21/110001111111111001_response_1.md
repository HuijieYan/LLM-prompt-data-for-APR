The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 8 of the git_fix_stash.py file. This is likely due to the command.script.split()[1] expression trying to access an index that does not exist. 

The bug is occurring because the split() function is being used without any checks for the length of the resulting list. If the script does not contain at least two words, the expression command.script.split()[1] will result in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the script contains at least two words before trying to access the second word as 'stash'. If the length of the split list is less than 2, there is no need to proceed with the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected code includes a check for the length of the split script. It ensures that the comparison is only made if the split script contains at least two words, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
