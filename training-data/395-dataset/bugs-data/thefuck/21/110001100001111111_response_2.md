The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is a git stash command with incorrect usage. The bug arises from the code `command.script.split()[1]`, which is trying to access the second element of the `script` attribute of the `command` object. In the given test case, the `script` attribute is "git", and when split, there are no elements beyond the first one, causing an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the `script` attribute contains "stash," and then check if the `stderr` attribute contains "usage:". This can be achieved using the following corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this corrected function, it will first check if "stash" is present in the command script and then if "usage:" is present in the command stderr, as intended. This approach resolves the IndexError that occurred in the original function.
