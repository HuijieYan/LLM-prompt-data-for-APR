Potential error location: The function is using a decorator `@git_support` which is not defined in the code.

Reason for the bug: The decorator `@git_support` is not defined, so it is causing a syntax error in the function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the decorator `@git_support` if it is not necessary for the function.
2. If `@git_support` is a custom decorator, define it properly with the required functionality.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
