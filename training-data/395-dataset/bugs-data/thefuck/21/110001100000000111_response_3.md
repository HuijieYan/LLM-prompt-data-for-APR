The error is occurring because the `command.script.split()` function is trying to split an empty script when the input command is just `git`, resulting in an `IndexError: list index out of range` because there are no elements to split.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before trying to access the second element. If the length is not greater than 1, we should return False.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    if len(script) > 1:
        return (script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
