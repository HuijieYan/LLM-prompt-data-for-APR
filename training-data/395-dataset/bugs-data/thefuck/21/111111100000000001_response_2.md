Potential error location: The error may be due to the comparison 'command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'' and 'usage:' in command.stderr.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The comparison 'command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'' assumes that the second word in the command is 'stash', which may not always be the case.
2. Additionally, the check for 'usage:' in command.stderr does not explicitly handle error cases where 'usage:' may not be present in the stderr.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the command starts with 'git stash' instead of assuming 'stash' is the second word in the command.
2. Use a more robust check for the presence of 'usage:' in command.stderr, and handle error cases appropriately.

Corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Check if the command starts with 'git stash' and 'usage:' is in the stderr
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```
