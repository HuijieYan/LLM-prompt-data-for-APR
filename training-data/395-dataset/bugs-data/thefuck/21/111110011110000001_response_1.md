Potential error location: The error occurs when trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()` without checking if the split actually results in multiple elements.

Reasons for the bug: The error is occurring because the `command.script.split()` may not always have enough elements to access the second one, resulting in an IndexError.

Approaches to fix the bug: We can fix this bug by first checking if the split result contains at least two elements before accessing the second one.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_command) > 1  # Check if there are at least 2 elements
            and split_command[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
