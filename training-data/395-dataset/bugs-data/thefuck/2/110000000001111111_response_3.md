The error in the provided function is that the `@memoize` decorator is not defined in the code, which causes a NameError.

To fix this issue, the `@memoize` decorator needs to be defined and applied to the `get_all_executables` function. The `@memoize` decorator is used to cache the results of the function so that if the function is called with the same parameters, the cached value is returned instead of recalculating the result.

Here's the corrected code with the `@memoize` decorator defined:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import six
from functools import lru_cache
from thefuck.shells.generic import get_alias

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_all_executables():

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In this corrected code:
- The `@lru_cache` decorator is used instead of `@memoize` to cache the results of the function.
- The `shell` object in the original code is not defined, so I've assumed it's meant to be a global object and kept it as is in the corrected code. If `shell` is supposed to be passed as an argument, it should be added to the function parameters.
