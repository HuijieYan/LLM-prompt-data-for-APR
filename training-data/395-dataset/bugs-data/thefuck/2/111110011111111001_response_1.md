Potential Error Location: The error occurs due to an assertion failure in the test function test_get_all_executables_pathsep. The failure happens when trying to assert if the calls made to Path_mock match the expected calls.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The mocked calls are not being made correctly due to the incorrect handling of Windows-style paths.
2. The use of the 'path.split(pathsep)' inside the asserted calls is not handling the Windows-style paths properly, causing the failure.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. The path split needs to account for Windows-style paths correctly.
2. Since the split path differs based on the operating system, the split logic should be handled separately for different operating systems, particularly for Windows.
3. By using an alternative approach to splitting the path to correctly imitate the actual behavior, the bug can be fixed.

The correct code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import six
from thefuck.shells import shell

def get_all_executables():
    tf_alias = shell.get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    def get_exes():
        return [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
                for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
                for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
                if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
                and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]

    def get_aliases():
        return [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
                for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return get_exes() + get_aliases()
```
