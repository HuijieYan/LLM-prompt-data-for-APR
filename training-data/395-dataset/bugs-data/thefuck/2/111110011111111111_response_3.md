The issue with the code is with the `@memoize` decorator used in the `get_all_executables` function. The `@memoize` decorator is not defined in the provided code, and it appears that it should be used to cache the results of the function. Additionally, the function `get_alias()` is called in the code, but it's not defined in the given function.

Considering the error message from the test function, it seems that the `Path_mock` is not being called with the expected paths. Instead, it is being called with partial paths and other function calls. This indicates that the function `_safe` and how it interacts with the `Path` module might be causing the issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `@memoize` decorator or import it from a suitable library to properly cache the results of the function.
2. Define the `get_alias` function or import it from the relevant module to ensure that it returns expected values.
3. Modify the `_safe` function to handle exceptions and calls to `Path` objects correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_all_executables` function:

```python
import os
import six
from thefuck.utils import get_alias
from thefuck.shells import shell
from pathlib import Path
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_all_executables():
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(lambda: exe.is_dir(), True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In the corrected code:
- The `@lru_cache` decorator is used to cache the results of the function.
- The `get_alias` function is imported and used.
- The `_safe` function is modified to handle the `is_dir` method call correctly within the list comprehension.
- The `Path` module is used directly for calling `iterdir` and `is_dir` methods.
