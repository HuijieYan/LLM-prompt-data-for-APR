The `get_all_executables` method isn't being used correctly. It's used as a decorator here but the decorator function `memoize` is not implemented within the `utils.py` file. Another function `_safe` is defined inside the `get_all_executables` method which is not ideal.

Here's the revised and corrected function(s):

1. Remove the decorator `@memoize` from `get_all_executables` method.
2.  Amend the `_safe` method definition to  be outside of the `get_all_executables` method.
3. Import the `six` module and the `os` module as they are referenced inside the `get_all_executables` function. Without them, this function will raise exceptions.

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_2/thefuck/utils.py

import six
import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _safe(fn, fallback):
    try:
        return fn()
    except OSError:
        return fallback
    pass

def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases    
```

For the test function, ensure that the `Path_mock` function is appropriately imported and implement the required `call` function for it. Without the implementation of this function, itâ€™s hard to deduce debugging issues during testing.
