The error occurs because of the call made to the `iterdir` function. The function is used in a list comprehension, and it seems that the `iterdir` function is being invoked improperly due to the slashes in the input path. This is leading to an assertion error in the test case.

To address the issue, it's important to properly handle the input path and invoke the `iterdir` function correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except (OSError, FileNotFoundError):
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda path=path: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In the corrected code, the os.pathsep is utilized instead of hardcoded values to correctly split the PATH environment variable. Additionally, the `FileNotFoundError` exception is handled along with `OSError`.

With these changes, the corrected function should work as expected without triggering assertion errors.
