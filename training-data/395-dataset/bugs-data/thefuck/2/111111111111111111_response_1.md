Potential Error location:

The error seems to be related to the way the `Path` objects are being created using the `path` and `pathsep` values, and the way they are being called using `_safe` and checked for directory using `_safe(exe.is_dir, True)`.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:

The current code does not handle the expected behavior of paths in both Unix (using `:` as the separator) and Windows (using `;` as the separator). Additionally, the use of `_safe` to check for directories may not be working as expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. To handle the expected behavior of paths on both Unix and Windows, the code should handle both `:` and `;` as path separators.
2. The calls to `_safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])` and `_safe(exe.is_dir, True)` should be reviewed and modified for correct behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import six

# relative function's signature in this file
def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _safe(fn, fallback):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']
    
    bins = []
    for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':'):
        path = path if not six.PY2 else path.decode('utf8')
        for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), []):
            if not _safe(lambda: exe.is_dir(), True) and exe.name not in tf_entry_points:
                bins.append(exe.name)

    aliases = [alias for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]
    return bins + aliases
```
