The error in the test case is likely due to the way calls to the `Path` class are being asserted within the `get_all_executables` function. The `Path` method is not being called correctly, causing an assertion error in the test case.

The issue is in the implementation of the `get_all_executables` function. It is using the `_safe` function incorrectly when checking if a path is a directory and when retrieving aliases from the shell. Additionally, the `Path` class is not being used properly.

To fix the bug, the `_safe` function should be refactored to correctly handle potential exceptions when calling the functions. The `Path` class should be used to check directories and access paths.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_all_executables` function:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from thefuck.shells import shell
import six

def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _safe(fn, fallback):
    try:
        return fn()
    except OSError:
        return fallback

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
                for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
                for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
                if not _safe(lambda: exe.is_dir(), True)
                and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
                for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
``` 

The refactored code ensures that the `Path` class is used correctly to iterate over the directories in the PATH environment variable. The `is_dir` method is called properly, and exceptions are handled within the `_safe` function.
