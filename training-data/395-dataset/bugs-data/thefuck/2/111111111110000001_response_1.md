The error message indicates that the `Path` mock has not been called with the expected paths. This suggests that the `get_all_executables` function is not correctly retrieving and processing the paths.

The potential error location within the problematic function is:
```python
for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
```

The reason for the bug is that the function `get_all_executables` is not correctly processing the system paths due to mishandling of the path separators.

To fix the bug, the approach would be to normalize the paths and ensure proper splitting using the correct path separator. Additionally, the conditional checks for directory existence and exclusion of certain entry points should be reviewed to ensure that the correct logic is being applied.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import six

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']
    
    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if exe.is_file() and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]
    
    return bins + aliases
```

In the corrected code, the system path is split using `os.pathsep` to correctly handle different operating systems. The paths are then processed to filter out directories and unwanted entry points, and the resulting list is combined with shell aliases to return the complete list of executables.
