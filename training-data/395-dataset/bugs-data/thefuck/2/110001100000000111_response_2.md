The potential error in the function `get_all_executables` is that the imports for `os` and `six` are missing, and the `Path` class is not imported from the `pathlib` module. Additionally, the `_safe` function is defined within the `get_all_executables` function, which is unnecessary since `_safe` is already defined outside the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the required modules and classes are not imported, and the `_safe` function is unnecessarily redefined within the `get_all_executables` function.

To fix the bug, the following imports should be added to the function:
```python
import os
import six
from pathlib import Path
```

The unnecessary redefinition of the `_safe` function within the `get_all_executables` function should be removed, and the function should only be called without redefining it.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_all_executables` function:

```python
# corrected function
@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    import os
    import six
    from pathlib import Path
    from thefuck.shells import shell

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
