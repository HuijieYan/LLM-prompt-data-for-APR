The 'get_all_executables' function is encountering a bug related to the way the 'path' string is split using 'pathsep' in the test case. The bug is causing the 'Path_mock' to have unexpected calls, as described in the error message. The expected calls are ('C:\\\\foo', 'C:\\\\bar', 'C:\\\\baz', 'C:\\\\foo\\\\bar') but the actual calls are different ('C', 'iterdir()', and so on). This discrepancy is causing the test case to fail.

The bug in the code is likely due to the incorrect splitting of the 'path' string based on the 'pathsep'. The 'path' string is being split using the 'pathsep', i.e., ';' or ':', but it is not being split correctly due to the use of the escape character '\\' in the 'path' string.

To fix the bug, the 'path' string should be correctly formatted and split based on 'pathsep' to create the 'Path_mock' calls as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_all_executables' function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import os
from thefuck.shells import shell
from six import PY2

def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _safe(fn, fallback):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    path = os.environ.get('PATH', '')  # Getting the PATH env variable
    pathsep = os.pathsep  # Using the built-in path separator based on the OS

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if PY2 else exe.name
            for path in path.split(pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In this corrected code, we have used the 'os.pathsep' to correctly split the 'path' string, and used 'os.environ.get' to retrieve the 'PATH' environment variable. We've also made several other minor corrections to make the method more readable and maintainable.
