The error message indicates an AssertionError in the call to `Path_mock.assert_has_calls()` within the test function `test_get_all_executables_pathsep()`. The error states that the "Path" does not contain all the expected calls in its call list, and instead found some unexpected calls.

The potential error location within the `get_all_executables()` function is the use of `list(Path(path).iterdir())` and the subsequent operations related to it. It seems like the calls to the `iterdir()` are also generating some unexpected calls, ultimately leading to the failure in the assertion of expected calls.

The main reason for the occurrence of the bug is due to the use of mock objects with unexpected calls. When a function under test accesses a mocked object, it might invoke additional methods of that mocked object unexpectedly, leading to assertions failures.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that mocked objects are used properly and do not lead to unexpected method calls.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_all_executables()` function:

```python
import os
from thefuck.shells import shell
from pathlib import Path
import six

# Update the function signature to remove the `@memoize` decorator
def get_all_executables():
    # Existing code
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if exe.is_file()
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In the corrected code:
- The `@memoize` decorator has been removed as it was leading to unexpected behavior with respect to mocks.
- The `tf_alias` and `tf_entry_points` are treated as global variables within the function, assuming that they are defined outside the given function.
