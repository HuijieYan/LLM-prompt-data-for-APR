The error in the test function is related to the presence of the '\\' character in the provided input string. This error is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of the path and path separator values within the `get_all_executables` function. 

Upon reviewing the buggy function, it appears that the portion of code responsible for parsing the input path is utilizing the `path.split(pathsep)` function call. In this particular situation, the provided 'path' input string may contain escape characters ('\\'). This is leading to incorrect splitting of the path, and in turn, resulting in an AssertionError within the test case.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to appropriately handle the path and path separator values within the `get_all_executables` function. This can be achieved by ensuring that the path separator is correctly utilized during the path splitting operation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    import os
    from pathlib import Path
    import six

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In this corrected version, the `os.pathsep` is utilized to split the path into individual elements. This ensures correct handling of the input paths containing escape characters, fixing the bug that caused the AssertionError in the provided test case.
