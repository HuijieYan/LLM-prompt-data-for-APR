The error occurs because the `Path` mock object receives calls that do not match the expected calls, as indicated by the AssertionError in the test output. The error is likely within the comprehension part of the list passed to `assert_has_calls`.

The buggy function `get_all_executables()` uses a `Path` mock object. The `Path` object uses the input `path` and `pathsep` to create calls. The calls are then compared against predefined calls, which is where the issue arises.

The buggy function fails to account for all the components of the `path` variable and the `pathsep`. This causes an assertion error during the test, as the expected and actual calls do not match due to incorrect splitting and concatenation.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to correctly split the `path` variable using the `pathsep`. Since the path separator can be different based on the operating system, it should be handled accordingly using the `os` module to get the correct separator.

The corrected function for `get_all_executables()` is provided below:

```python
import os
from thefuck.shells import shell

def get_all_executables():
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    pathsep = os.pathsep  # Get the correct path separator based on the OS
    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

This corrected function uses `os.pathsep` to get the correct path separator based on the operating system. It then correctly splits the `path` variable using `os.pathsep` to ensure that all components of the path are accounted for and processed correctly.
