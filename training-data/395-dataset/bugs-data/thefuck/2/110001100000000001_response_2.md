The potential error in the `get_all_executables` function is that the `six` library is being used without being imported. Additionally, the `os` and `Path` modules are also not imported, but they are being used in the function.

The reason for this bug is that the required modules are not imported, so the referenced functions and classes are not defined.

To fix the bug, the `six`, `os`, and `Path` modules need to be imported. Additionally, the `from thefuck.shells import shell` statement should be moved outside of the `get_all_executables` function as it's not directly being used inside the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_all_executables` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_2/thefuck/utils.py

import os
from pathlib import Path
import six
from thefuck.shells import shell

# relative function's signature in this file
def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _safe(fn, fallback):
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

# this is the fixed function
@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
