The bug in the function seems to be related to incorrect calls to the `Path` class and incorrect splitting of the path parameter using the pathsep. This results in the AssertionError raised in the test case.

This is mostly because the file path formats are not being handled properly which leads to incorrect splitting and assertion error in the test case. 

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the path parameters are handled in a platform-independent manner and the splitting of the path using pathsep is performed correctly. 

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from pathlib import Path

def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
In this corrected code, the splitting of the path is performed using `os.pathsep` to ensure platform independence, and the `Path` class from `pathlib` is used, allowing ease of usage for different path formats.
