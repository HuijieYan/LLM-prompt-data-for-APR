The bug in the provided function arises due to the way the `_safe` function is used within the `get_all_executables` function. The `_safe` function is called with a lambda to create a list of executables from the environment's PATH. However, the error message from the test function indicates that the `Path_mock` does not contain all the expected calls. This suggests that the call to `Path` might be the source of the issue.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the input parameter `path` is correctly handled and the `Path_mock` is being called with the correct arguments. Additionally, the calls to the `exe.name` might need to be handled more carefully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from thefuck.shells import shell
import six

# Relative function signature in this file
def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Relative function signature in this file
def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Relative function signature in this file
def _safe(fn, fallback):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Buggy function is fixed
@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(lambda: exe.is_dir(), True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

This corrected code ensures that the proper handling of file and directory names, `PATH` parsing, and `os` module functions is performed, thereby addressing the potential sources of the bug.
