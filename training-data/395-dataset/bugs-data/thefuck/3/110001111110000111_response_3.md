The error in the provided code is occurring because the function `info` is not correctly reading the version of the Fish shell. 

The `info` function is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. However, the test case is expecting the command `fish --version` to be executed. This mismatch in the command being executed is causing the function to return an unexpected version string, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the command being executed in the `info` function should be changed to `fish --version` in order to match the expectation in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

By modifying the shell.command from `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to `fish --version` in the `info` method, the function will now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell, resolving the issue.
