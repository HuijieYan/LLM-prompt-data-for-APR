The error occurs in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The function retrieves the version of the fish shell and returns it in the format "Fish Shell version_number". However, it seems that the function is not calling the correct command to fetch the version of the shell and therefore not formatting it correctly.

The potential error location is in the command being executed to fetch the version of the shell:

```python
Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
```

The command being called does not fetch the version information correctly, leading to the incorrect version being returned.

To fix this bug, the command being executed should be modified to fetch the shell version correctly:

```python
Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
```

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
