The error occurs in the test case `test_info` where it is expected that `shell.info()` will return `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but it actually returns `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`. This mismatch causes the Assertion error.

The bug is located in the `info` method of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file. The incorrect value returned in the `info` method is due to a hardcoded string `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` being used to get the version of Fish shell. This results in an extra "fish, version" being added to the output.

To fix the bug, the command `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` should be replaced with `['fish', '-v']` to correctly obtain the Fish shell version.

Here is the corrected `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By making this change, the method will properly capture the version of the Fish shell.

This fix will address the issue where the `thefuck -v` command causes a recursive loop due to the incorrect values being returned in the `info` method.
