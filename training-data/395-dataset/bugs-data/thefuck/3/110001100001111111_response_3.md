The bug in the provided code is that the Popen function from the subprocess module is not imported. Additionally, the DEVNULL variable is not defined. 

This bug could cause the info() function to fail as it cannot execute the Popen command without importing the subprocess module.

To fix this bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. Import the Popen and DEVNULL from the subprocess module.
2. Use the Popen function with stdout and stderr as arguments to execute the command to get the FISH version.

Here's the corrected code for the info() function:

```python
import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
