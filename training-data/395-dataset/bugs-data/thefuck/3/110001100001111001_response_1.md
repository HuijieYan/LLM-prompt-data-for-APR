Potential error location: The error may be in the way the Popen function is being used to capture the output from the command 'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION''. 

Reasons for the bug: The Popen function is not being handled correctly, leading to issues in capturing the standard output from the command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the usage of Popen to correctly capture the output from the command.
- Use the communicate() method of the Popen object to obtain the output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
