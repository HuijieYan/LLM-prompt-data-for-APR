Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring because the Popen function from subprocess module is not being imported and used correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The Popen function from the subprocess module is not being imported at the beginning of the file and is not being used with the correct parameters. Additionally, the stdout and stderr constants are not being imported from the subprocess module.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the Popen function from the subprocess module at the beginning of the file.
2. Also, import the stdout and stderr constants from the subprocess module to use them in the Popen function.
3. Use the correct parameters in the Popen function, such as shell=True if using a shell and capture_output=True to capture the output.

Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True, text=True, capture_output=True)
    version = proc.stdout.strip()
    return 'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```
