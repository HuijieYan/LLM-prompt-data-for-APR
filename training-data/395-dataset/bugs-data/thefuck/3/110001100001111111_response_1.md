Potential error location: The problem seems to be with the Popen command not capturing the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command properly.

Reasons behind the bug: The Popen command is not being handled correctly, which results in the function not returning the expected version information.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the communicate() method instead of just reading the stdout to ensure all data is captured properly.
2. Check for any errors in the Popen command and handle them appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
