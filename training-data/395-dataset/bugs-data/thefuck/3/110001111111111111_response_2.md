The test case `test_info` is trying to assert that the output of `shell.info()` is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', however, the actual output includes the version number '3.5.9' within a string that also includes 'fish, version'. This indicates that the bug is likely in the `info` function, where the version string is not being properly formatted.

The reason for the bug is that the `info` function is not formatting the version string correctly before returning it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to properly format the version string by including 'Fish Shell' before the version number.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                    stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected code, the `Popen` command is changed to `['fish', '--version']` to properly get the version of the Fish shell. The version is then extracted from the output and formatted as 'Fish Shell version_number'. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
