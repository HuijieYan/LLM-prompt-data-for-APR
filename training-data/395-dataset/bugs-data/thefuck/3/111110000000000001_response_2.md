Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the line where we are trying to get the Fish shell version using the `Popen` method.

Reason for the Bug: The `Popen` method is not being used correctly and may result in incomplete or incorrect data being returned. Additionally, the `Popen` method is not being properly handled, and this may lead to a resource leak. 

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `subprocess` module instead of the `Popen` method to capture the output of the command more reliably.
2. Ensure that the process is properly handled and closed to avoid resource leaks.

Corrected Code:
```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
