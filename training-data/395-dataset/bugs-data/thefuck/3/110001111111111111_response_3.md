The test case asserts that the output of `shell.info()` should be "Fish Shell 3.5.9", but the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9". This indicates that the function is not correctly formatting the version string.

The potential error location is the line `return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` inside the `info` function. The `version` variable is not being formatted correctly.

The bug occurred because the function is not correctly formatting the version string before returning it. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command returns "fish, version 3.5.9", but the function is not properly formatting it to "3.5.9".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `version` variable is formed before being returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This code uses the `split` method to separate the string "fish, version 3.5.9" into two parts and extracts the version number, which is then formatted correctly before being returned.
