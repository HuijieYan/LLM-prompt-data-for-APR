The potential error in the given function is the use of the `Popen` function without importing it from the `subprocess` module. This will result in a NameError as 'Popen' is not defined.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'Popen' function is a part of the 'subprocess' module, but it is being used without importing the module itself.

To fix the bug, we need to import the 'subprocess' module and then use the 'Popen' function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
By importing the `subprocess` module and using `subprocess.Popen` instead of `Popen`, we have fixed the bug in the given function.
