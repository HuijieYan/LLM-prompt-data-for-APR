The error occurred because the `Popen` call should pass `['fish', '--version']` as the command, not `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This caused the return value to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just '3.5.9', creating the mismatch in the test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` function to use the correct command when calling `Popen` and then extract just the version number from the output.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By using `['fish', '--version']`, we ensure that the version output is just the version number without any additional text. Then, by splitting the output and taking the last element, we can extract just the version number from the output.
