The error occurs in the `info` method of the `Fish` class due to the incorrect command used to get the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not the correct way to get the Fish shell version.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.
2. Update the return statement to include the correct version obtained from the command.

Below is the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
