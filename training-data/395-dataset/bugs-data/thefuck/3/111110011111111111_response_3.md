The error in the function is caused by the incorrect command being used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The function is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION` which is not the correct command to get the version.

To fix the bug, the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is `fish --version`.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` method in the `Fish` class:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, the function will now return the expected version, and the test case will pass without any assertion errors.
