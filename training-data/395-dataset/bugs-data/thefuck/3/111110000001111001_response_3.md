The issue in the provided function is that it is trying to access the stdout and stderr attributes of the Popen object using MagicMock, which is a mock object used for testing. This is not the expected behavior and it's causing the function to return incorrect values.

To fix this issue, the Popen object should be properly instantiated with the correct command and shell set to True. Additionally, the subprocess module should be imported at the beginning of the file as it is used to work with additional processes, such as the shell.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import subprocess

# class declaration containing the updated function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                                stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True, universal_newlines=True)
        version = proc.stdout.read().strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the function should now return the expected values based on the provided test case.
