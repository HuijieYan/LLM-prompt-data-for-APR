The error occurs because the function is not correctly reading the version output from the command. The function is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' as the command to retrieve the version, but the test case expects the output to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' instead of just '3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the version from 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to 'fish --version'. This will ensure that the version is retrieved in the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
