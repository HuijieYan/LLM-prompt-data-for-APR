In the provided test case, the `Popen` object is being used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The expected shell version is 'fish, version 3.5.9' but the actual result is '3.5.9'. This discrepancy indicates that the command used to retrieve the version of the shell is incorrect.

The issue lies in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The method is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to get the version, but it should be using `['fish', '--version']` instead.

The reason for the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. It is not providing the expected version string that the test case is asserting.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version should be changed to `['fish', '--version']`. This will ensure that the correct version string is retrieved and the test case will pass successfully.

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
