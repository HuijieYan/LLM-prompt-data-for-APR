The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to take a command and its settings, extract a URL from the command, and then return a new command with the URL formatted for opening in a browser.

The potential error is in the line that returns the new command: 

```python
return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
```

The bug occurs because when trying to extract the URL from the command, the function incorrectly assumes that the URL starts at the 5th character of the script. This assumption is incorrect because the URL doesn't always start at the 5th character.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to correctly identify the URL within the command script and use that to form the new command for opening in a browser.

The corrected function should be as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url_start = command.script.find('open ') + len('open ')
    url = command.script[url_start:]
    return f'open http://{url}'
```

This updated function uses the `find` method to locate the position of the URL and then extracts the URL to form the new command. This approach will work correctly regardless of the length of the URL or the position of 'open' in the original command script.
