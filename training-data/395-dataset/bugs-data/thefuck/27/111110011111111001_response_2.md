The issue with the given buggy function `get_new_command` is that it assumes the input `command` to be of type `Command` which has an attribute `script`. However, the test cases indicate that the actual input parameter is of type `str`. 

To fix this issue, the function should first check the type of the `command` input. If it is of type `str`, then it should directly use it. If it is of type `Command`, then it should access its `script` attribute.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
- Failure to handle different types of input for the `command` parameter.
- The buggy function assumes the structure of the `command` parameter without validating it.

The following is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if isinstance(command, str):
        return 'open http://' + command[5:]
    elif command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command.script if it doesn't start with 'open'
```

The corrected function first checks if the `command` is of type `str` and uses it directly. If it's of type `Command`, it checks if the `script` attribute starts with 'open ' and then constructs the new command accordingly. If it doesn't start with 'open ', it returns the original `command.script`.
