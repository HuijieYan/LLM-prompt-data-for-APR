The buggy function is `get_new_command`. The purpose of this function is to add 'http://' to the beginning of the script provided in the command. The bug is that the return statement is incorrectly slicing the script.

The bug occurs in the return statement:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
```

The bug occurs because the value `command.script[5:]` will only take the characters from index 5 to the end of the string, but it doesn't take into account the 'http://'. This results in the incorrect value being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the hardcoded indexing and combine the 'http://' with the actual script value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return f'open http://{command.script.split()[1]}'
```

With the corrected code, the `get_new_command` function should work as intended and pass the provided test cases.
