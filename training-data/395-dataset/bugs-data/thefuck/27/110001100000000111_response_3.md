Potential error location:
The error may be occurring in the index reference when retrieving the substring from the command script.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the index reference [5:] does not accurately capture the URL from the command script. This may lead to incorrect or incomplete URL extraction.

Possible approaches:
To fix the bug, we can use regular expressions to accurately capture the URL from the input command script.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    match = re.search(r'http://\S+', command.script)
    if match:
        return 'open ' + match.group(0)
    else:
        return ''
```
