The error in the function is due to the incorrect slicing of the `command.script` string. The buggy function's logic is to append "http://" to the URL, but it incorrectly assumes that the URL always starts after the 5th character of the input string. This is the reason for the incorrect output and assertion failures in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should identify the position of "http://" in the input string and handle different cases where the input string might not always start with "open". Additionally, it should consider cases where the input string starts with "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open".

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    open_command = command.script.split(' ', 1)
    domain = open_command[1]
    
    if open_command[0] in ['xdg-open', 'gnome-open', 'kde-open']:
        return open_command[0] + ' http://' + domain
    else:
        return 'open http://' + domain
```

This implementation splits the command script to check for "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open" and appends "http://" to the domain accordingly. This corrected code should address the bug and produce the expected results for the given test cases.
