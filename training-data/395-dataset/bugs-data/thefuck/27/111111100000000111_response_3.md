Potential error location: The function is trying to extract a URL from the input command but is doing so in a non-generic way.

Reasons for the bug: The function assumes that the URL always follows this specific format: "http://<remainder of the command>". This is not a generic assumption and could lead to errors with other URLs or commands.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use regex to extract the URL from the input command in a generic and reliable way.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url = re.search("(?P<url>https?://[^\s]+)", command.script)
    if url:
        return 'open ' + url.group("url")
    else:
        return "URL not found in the command"
```
