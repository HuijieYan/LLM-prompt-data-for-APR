The buggy function is designed to extract the website address from the input command and open it in a browser. However, the function has a bug where it always assumes that the command starts with "open" followed by the website address. This assumption is incorrect because some commands may start with other prefixes like "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open".

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle different prefixes and extract the website address accordingly. One approach to fix the bug is by using regular expressions to match different prefixes and extract the website address.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    match = re.match(r'(open|xdg-open|gnome-open|kde-open)\s+(.*)', command.script)
    if match:
        return f'{match.group(1)} http://{match.group(2)}'
    else:
        return command.script  # return the original command if no match is found
```

In this corrected function, we use the `re.match` function to match different prefixes (open, xdg-open, gnome-open, kde-open) along with the website address. If a match is found, the function constructs the new command using the matched prefix and website address. If no match is found, we return the original command. This approach ensures that different prefixes are handled correctly, and the website address is extracted based on the specific prefix used in the input command.
