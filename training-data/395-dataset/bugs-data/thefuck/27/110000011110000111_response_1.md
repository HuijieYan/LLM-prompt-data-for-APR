The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it tries to extract the URL from the command by taking a substring starting from the 5th character. However, this approach to extract the URL is not accounting for the 'http://' part that already exists in the command. This results in the output that includes a partial URL along with 'http://' which is already part of the original command, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `get_new_command` function to first check if the command already includes 'http://'. If it does, then it should simply return the original command. If it doesn't include 'http://', then it should append 'http://' to the extracted URL.

Here is the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if 'http://' in command.script:
        return command.script
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
```

By making these changes to the function, it will correctly handle the cases where the command already includes 'http://' and only extract and append the URL when necessary. This should resolve the mismatch errors in the test cases.
