The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to take a command and modify it to include a missing part. The problem with this function is that it relies on a specific index of the `command.script` string, which can cause errors if the input format is not consistent with the expected format.

The main issue here is that the function assumes the command always starts with "open " and then followed by a URL. If the command is anything other than this pattern, the function will break.

To fix this, we can modify the function to check if the string starts with "open " and then extract the URL. If the string format is not this way, a more generic approach can be taken to handle various types of commands.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command if it doesn't start with 'open '
```
