The buggy function `get_new_command` takes in two parameters, `command` and `settings`, and returns a URL. The function attempts to extract a URL from the `command` parameter and appends it to the string 'open http://'. However, the function incorrectly extracts the URL from the command script.

The bug occurs because the function erroneously assumes that the URL always starts at the 6th character of the script. This assumption is incorrect and leads to the function returning an incorrect URL.

To fix the bug, we need to find a more reliable method to extract the URL. One possible approach is to split the string by spaces and extract the second element of the resulting list, as the example input parameter values appear to follow a pattern where the URL is the second word in the script.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return 'open http://' + split_script[1]
    else:
        return 'Invalid command. No URL found in the script.'
```

This corrected code assumes that the URL is always the second word in the `command.script`. If this assumption is incorrect, a more advanced approach, such as using regular expressions, may be required to reliably extract the URL from the command script.
