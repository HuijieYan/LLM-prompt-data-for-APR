Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the line `return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]`. The use of `command.script[5:]` may not be appropriate for all cases.

Reason behind the bug: The function is attempting to extract a substring from `command.script` without checking if it's valid, which can lead to index out of range error or incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the length of `command.script` before attempting to extract a substring to avoid index out of range error.
2. Validate the input `command.script` to ensure it starts with "http://" before extracting the substring.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith("http://"):
        return 'open ' + command.script
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```
