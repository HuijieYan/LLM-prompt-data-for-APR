Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the indexing of the command.script list.

Reasons behind the bug:
The buggy function is trying to extract the URL from the command script by using an index of 5. However, this method is not reliable as the URL may not always be at the 5th index of the command script.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if the command script contains a URL and then extract it. We can use regular expressions to achieve this in a more robust way.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url_match = re.search(r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+', command.script)
    if url_match:
        return 'open ' + url_match.group(0)
    else:
        return command
```
