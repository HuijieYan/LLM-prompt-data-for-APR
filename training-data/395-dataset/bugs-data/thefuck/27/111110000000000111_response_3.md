Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the expression command.script[5:], since it is trying to access the 5th index of the command.script without checking if it exists.

Reason for the bug: The function assumes that the command.script has at least 5 characters, which may not always be the case. This leads to an index out of range error when trying to access the 5th index of a shorter string.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can modify the function to first check if the command.script has at least 5 characters before trying to access the 5th index. If it doesn't, we can handle it gracefully by returning an error message or taking alternative action.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if len(command.script) < 5:
        return 'Error: Command script is too short'
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
```
