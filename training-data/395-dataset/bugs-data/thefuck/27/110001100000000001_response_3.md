Potential error location: 

The issue is with the "command.script[5:]" part of the function, which is likely intended to extract the URL from the command.


Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function assumes that the URL always starts at the 6th character of the command.script, which may not always be the case.
2. It doesn't handle cases where the URL is not present at the expected index, leading to potential errors or improper behavior.


Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use string manipulation to extract the URL from the command.script in a more reliable way.
2. Add error handling to ensure that the function can handle cases where the URL is not found in the expected location.


Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    # Find the index of the first occurrence of 'http' in the command.script
    url_index = command.script.find('http')
    # If 'http' is found, extract the URL from that index
    if url_index != -1:
        url = command.script[url_index:]
        return 'open ' + url
    else:
        # If 'http' is not found, handle the error by returning the original command
        return command.script
```
