The potential error location within the problematic function is the string slicing operation `command.script[5:]` in the `get_new_command` function. This operation is supposed to extract the URL from the command script, but it is currently extracting the characters after the 5th index, which is leading to incorrect URLs in the new command.

The error message in the test function is caused by the incorrect behavior of the `get_new_command` function, which results in the generated command not matching the expected new command.

To fix this bug, we need to update the slicing operation to correctly extract the URL from the command script. One possible approach is to split the original command script by spaces and take the second part (index 1) as the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    # Split the command script by spaces and take the second part as the URL
    url = command.script.split()[1]
    return f'open http://{url}'
```

With this correction, the function will correctly extract the URL from the command script and generate the new command as expected. This will resolve the assertion errors in the test cases.
