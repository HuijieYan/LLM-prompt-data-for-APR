The error in the provided code is occurring because the string's index is hardcoded to 5 without checking if the command is 'open' or any other command.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function assumes that the command always starts with 'open', and then it uses "command.script[5:]" to extract the URL from the command. However, this assumption may not always hold true as seen in some test cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the command starts with 'open' and then extract the URL. If the command does not start with 'open', it should return the original command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```
