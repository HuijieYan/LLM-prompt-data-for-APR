The buggy function takes in a command and settings as input, and then attempts to return a new command by appending "open http://" to the input command. However, it is incorrectly using the `command.script` attribute directly without checking if it actually starts with "open". This would cause an error if the input command doesn't start with "open".

To fix this bug, we should first check if the `command.script` starts with "open" before trying to use it. If it does, we can then proceed to return the new command with "http://" appended to it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open'):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```
