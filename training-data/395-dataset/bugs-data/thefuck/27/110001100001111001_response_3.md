The buggy function is intended to take a command as input, extract the URL from it, and return a new command to open that URL in a web browser.

The bug occurs in the line: 'open http://' + command.script[5:], which tries to extract the URL from the command by taking all characters after the fifth character in the script. This works if the command always starts with "open ", however, in situations like "xdg-open" and "gnome-open" the command may start with these prefixes and the position of the URL would be different.

To fix this bug, we can split the script using a whitespace as the separator and extract the second element (if available) as the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if "open" in command.script:
        url = command.script.split(" ", 1)[1]
        return 'open http://' + url
    else:
        return command.script
```
