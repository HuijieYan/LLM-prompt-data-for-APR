The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it is not correctly extracting the URL from the input command.

In the initial implementation, the function returns 'open http://' followed by the substring starting from the 5th character of the command script. This is incorrect because it assumes that the URL always starts from the 5th character, which is not the case.

As a result, the test cases fail as they expect the correct URL to be appended to the command, but the function concatenates the incorrect substring.

To fix the bug, the function needs to identify the URL within the input command and append it to the new command. Additionally, for commands like 'xdg-open', 'gnome-open', and 'kde-open', the URL should still be appended to the corresponding command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    command_parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if len(command_parts) > 1:
        url = command_parts[1]
        return command_parts[0] + ' http://' + url
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected function first splits the input command by spaces and checks if the parts of the command are greater than 1. If they are, it extracts the URL from the second part of the command and appends it to the first part along with 'http://'. Otherwise, it returns None.
