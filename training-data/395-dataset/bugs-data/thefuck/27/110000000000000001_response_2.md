Potential error: The function is trying to access the 'script' attribute of the 'command' parameter without checking if it exists. This can lead to an AttributeError if 'script' is not present in the 'command' object.

Reason behind the bug: The function is assuming that the 'command' object has a 'script' attribute without any validation.

Approach for fixing the bug: Check if the 'command' object has the 'script' attribute before accessing it to avoid AttributeError.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if hasattr(command, 'script'):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'Invalid command'
```
