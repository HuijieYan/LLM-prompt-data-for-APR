Potential error location: 
The issue lies in the function's attempt to concatenate the 'open http://' string with the command.script[5:], which might not be present in the command input.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the command.script argument will always be at least 5 characters long, leading to an index out of range error if it is not.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the length of command.script before trying to access index 5.
2. Handle the case where command.script might be shorter than the expected length.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if len(command.script) > 5:
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'open http://'
```
