The test function is designed to check whether the get_new_command function is returning the expected result based on the given command input. The error messages indicate that the function is not generating the expected output.

The potential error in the get_new_command function is the incorrect indexing of the command.script string. The current implementation uses command.script[5:], which assumes that the URL starts at the 6th character of the command.script. This is causing the generated URL to start with 'pen' instead of the actual URL.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to use the correct indexing for extracting the URL from the command.script. Additionally, it should also include a check to verify that the command actually starts with 'open' before extracting the URL.

Here's the corrected version of the get_new_command function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return f'open http://{command.script[5:]}'
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected function first checks if the command starts with 'open'. If it does, it constructs the new command with the correct URL prefixed with 'http://'. Otherwise, it returns the original command.script.
