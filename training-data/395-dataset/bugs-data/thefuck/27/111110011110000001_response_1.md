The error in the given code is in the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to take a command and return a modified command that prepends "open http://" to the original command.

The error message indicates that the output of the function does not match the expected new_command. This error occurs consistently for all the test cases, suggesting that the problem lies within the function itself.

The bug in the function occurs because it attempts to extract the URL from the command using a fixed index (5), assuming that the URL always starts at the 5th character of the input command. However, this is not a reliable assumption as the length of the protocol (e.g., "open" or "xdg-open") can vary, resulting in an incorrect extraction of the URL.

To fix this bug, the function should properly parse the input command to extract the URL. This can be achieved by splitting the command by whitespace and then identifying the element that starts with the desired protocol, and extracting the remainder of that element as the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    tokens = command.script.split()
    for token in tokens:
        if token.startswith('open'):
            return ' '.join(['open', 'http://' + token.split('open')[1]])
    return ''
```

With this correction, the function will extract the URL component correctly based on the protocol specified in the input command. This should resolve the issue observed in the test cases.
