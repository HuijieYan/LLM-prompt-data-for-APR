The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a command and return a new command with 'http://' added to the beginning. However, it currently slices the command incorrectly due to the hard-coded index `command.script[5:]`. This rigid slicing causes issues when the command is not in the expected format (e.g., 'xdg-open', 'gnome-open', 'kde-open').

To fix this bug, we need to dynamically extract the URL from the command regardless of its prefix, and then concatenate it with 'http://' to build the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    url = None
    for token in split_command:
        if '.' in token:
            url = token
            break
    if url:
        return f"{split_command[0]} http://{url}"
    else:
        return command.script
```

In this corrected function, we split the original command into tokens and then search for the first token containing a period (indicative of a domain name). If found, we construct the new command with 'http://' added to the extracted URL. If no such token is found, we return the original command as is. This approach ensures that the function now handles various commands correctly.
