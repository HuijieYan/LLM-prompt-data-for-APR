The error is in the function `get_new_command`. It is concatenating the string 'open http://' with `command.script[5:]`, which is causing the incorrect output. 

The reason for the bug is that `command.script[5:]` is not extracting the correct part of the URL. It should extract the entire URL after 'open ', rather than starting from the fifth character.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use string manipulation to extract the URL correctly. We can split the `command.script` by spaces and take the second part, which will be the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url = command.script.split(' ')[1]
    return 'open http://' + url
```
