The provided buggy function is `get_new_command`. It takes two parameters `command` and `settings`. The function aims to return a new command that includes 'http://' before the provided URL in the `command` parameter.

Looking at the error message and the buggy function, the issue is with the concatenation of the strings. The current implementation only includes the script from the 5th index of the command. However, it fails to check for the presence of the 'http://' prefix. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if the script already includes 'http://' or not. If it does, then we don't need to add it again. If it doesn't, then we need to add 'http://' before the script.

Below is the corrected implementation of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url_prefix = 'http://'
    script = command.script[len('open '):]
    
    if url_prefix in script:
        return 'open ' + script
    else:
        return 'open ' + url_prefix + script
```

This corrected implementation will handle the cases where the script already includes 'http://' and will return the new command accordingly.
