The buggy function is supposed to return a modified command by adding "http://" in front of the original command. However, the bug occurs due to the incorrect string slicing and concatenation in the return statement.

The buggy function takes in a `command` object with a `script` attribute and a `settings` object. It attempts to modify the `command.script` by adding "http://" in front of it. 

The bug occurs because the slicing operation is hardcoded to `command.script[5:]`, which assumes that the input string always starts with "open ". This fails if the input string starts with "xdg-open", "gnome-open", "kde-open" or if the input string doesn't start with "open ".

A better approach is to split the `command.script` at the space, and use the second part of the split to concatenate with "http://". If the input string doesn't contain a space or doesn't start with "open ", it should use the original string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split(' ', 1)
    if len(parts) > 1 and parts[0] in ['open', 'xdg-open', 'gnome-open', 'kde-open']:
        return parts[0] + ' http://' + parts[1]
    else:
        return command.script
```
