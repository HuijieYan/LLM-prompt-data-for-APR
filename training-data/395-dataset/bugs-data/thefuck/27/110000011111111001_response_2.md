The potential error in the provided buggy function is the incorrect slicing of the command.script in the line "command.script[5:]". The buggy function is trying to remove the first five characters from the command.script, but it's not always the correct approach as the command.script can have different formats.

The error is occurring because the code is not accounting for different URL formats and is assuming that the command.script always starts with "open".

To fix the bug, we can use regular expressions to extract the URL from the command.script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url = re.search('(https?://[^\s]+)', command.script)
    if url:
        return 'open ' + url.group(1)
    else:
        return 'No URL found in command'
```

This code uses a regular expression to search for URLs in the command.script. If a URL is found, it appends "open" to the URL and returns the new command. Otherwise, it returns a message indicating that no URL was found. This approach is more robust and can handle different URL formats.
