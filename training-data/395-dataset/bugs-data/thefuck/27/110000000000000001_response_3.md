Potential Error Location:
The error is likely to occur in the concatenation of the URL string. 

Reason behind the Bug:
The current function assumes that the `command` object has a property called `script`, and it tries to access the substring of `command.script` starting from index 5 without any validation.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
We need to first check if the `command` object has a property called `script`, and if it does, then perform the substring operation. If the property doesn't exist, we should handle this case appropriately, such as returning an error message or a default URL.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if 'script' in command and len(command.script) > 5:
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'Error: Invalid command'
```
