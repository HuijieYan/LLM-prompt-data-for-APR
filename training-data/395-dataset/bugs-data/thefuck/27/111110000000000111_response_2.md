Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]` as it is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, which may not exist.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: It seems that the `command` object does not have a `script` attribute, causing the function to throw an error.

Approaches for fixing the bug: We can modify the function to check if the `command` object has a `script` attribute before trying to access it. If the `script` attribute is not present, we can either return an empty string or handle the case in a way that makes sense for the application.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if hasattr(command, 'script'):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return ''  # or handle the case in a way that makes sense for the application
```
