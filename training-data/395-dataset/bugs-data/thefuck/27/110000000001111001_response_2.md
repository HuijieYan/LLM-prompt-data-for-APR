The function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a command and extract a URL from it, then return a new command to open that URL. However, the current implementation only works if the input command has the format "open [URL]". This means that if the input command is in a different format, the function will not work as expected. 

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle different input formats and still extract the URL correctly. This can be achieved by splitting the input command string and extracting the URL based on the presence of specific keywords like "open", "http://" or "www.".

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open ' + command.script.replace('open ', '')
    elif 'http://' in command.script:
        return 'open ' + command.script.split('http://')[1]
    elif 'www.' in command.script:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
    else:
        # handle other cases as needed
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```
