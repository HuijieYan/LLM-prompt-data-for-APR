The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to append "http://" before the command.script URL. However, it is using a hardcoded index `5` to slice the string, which is causing issues.

The bug is occurring because the function is using a fixed index value `[5:]`, assuming that the URL always starts at the 6th character. This is not always the case, and it causes issues when the command has a different format.

The `get_new_command` function can be fixed by finding the position of the space character and then using that position to extract the URL from the command.script. This will make the function more robust and handle different URL formats correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    first_space_index = command.script.find(' ')
    if first_space_index != -1:
        url = command.script[first_space_index+1:]
        return 'open http://' + url
    return command.script  # Return the original command if no URL is found
```
