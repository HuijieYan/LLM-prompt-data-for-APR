The error occurs in the function `get_new_command` where it attempts to modify the command by appending `'http://'` to it. However, the current implementation only considers the string after the 5th character of the input `command.script`, which leads to the incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly extracting the domain name from the input command. It is assuming that the domain name always starts at the 5th character, which is not true for all cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to extract the domain name from the input command and append it to `'http://'` to create the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if len(parts) > 1:
        return 'open http://' + parts[1]
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```

This corrected code splits the input `command.script` by spaces and extracts the domain name, then appends it to `'http://'` to create the new command. This should fix the bug and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
