The buggy function receives a command script and extracts the URL from it using string slicing. However, this approach is error-prone as it assumes that the URL will always start at the 6th index of the input string `command.script`. This is not a reliable assumption, especially if there are variations in the command format.

To fix this, we can split the `command.script` string based on whitespace and extract the URL if it starts with 'open'. If not, we can return the original command as is.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if parts[0] == 'open' and len(parts) > 1 and parts[1].startswith(("http://", "https://")):
        return 'open ' + parts[1]
    else:
        return command.script
```
