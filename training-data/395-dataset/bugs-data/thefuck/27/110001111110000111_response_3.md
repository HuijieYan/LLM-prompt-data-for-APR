The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to add `http://` to the script of the given command. However, the implementation in the buggy function is not correctly accessing the script and appending `http://` to it, resulting in the wrong output.

The error occurs because the buggy function is mistakenly adding 'open' before 'http://' and missing a space between 'open' and 'http'. This results in the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the buggy function to properly access the script of the given command and append 'http://' to it with a space before it.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return command.script[:command.script.find(' ')+1] + 'http://' + command.script[command.script.find(' ')+1:]
```
