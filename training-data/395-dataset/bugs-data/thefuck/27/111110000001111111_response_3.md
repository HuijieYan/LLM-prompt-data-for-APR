The current function is trying to access the 6th character of the `command.script` and build the URL. However, this approach is not reliable, especially if the `command.script` changes. It doesn't take into consideration the possibility of different URLs starting with "open".

The bug in the function is caused by the hardcoded index in `command.script[5:]` which doesn't cover all possible scenarios.

To fix this bug, we should split the `command.script` string by space and take the second part as the URL. This approach will work with the provided test cases and also for URLs with different lengths, as long as they are always preceded by "open".

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return 'open http://' + command.script.split(' ')[1]
```
