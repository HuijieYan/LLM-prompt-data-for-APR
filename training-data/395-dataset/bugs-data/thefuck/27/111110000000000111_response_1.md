Potential error: The function is trying to access the 6th character of the 'script' attribute of the 'command' object, but it should be accessing the 7th character.

Reason for the bug: The function is incorrectly indexing the 'script' attribute of the 'command' object, resulting in an incorrect substring.

Approach for fixing the bug: Adjust the indexing to properly access the substring from the 'script' attribute.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return 'open http://' + command.script[6:]
```
