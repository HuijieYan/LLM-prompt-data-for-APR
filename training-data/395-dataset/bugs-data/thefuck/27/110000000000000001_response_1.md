Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the command.script[5:] part of the code, which is trying to extract the URL from the command.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The function is trying to extract the URL from the command, but it is not handling the case where the command may not contain a valid URL.
2. There is no check to ensure that the command has the correct format before extracting the URL.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the command has a valid URL format before extracting it.
2. Handle the case where the command may not contain a valid URL.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('http://') or command.script.startswith('https://'):
        return 'open ' + command.script
    else:
        return 'Invalid command format: ' + command.script
```
