Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the slicing of the `command.script` string.

Reason for the bug: The current implementation of the function tries to slice the `command.script` string starting from the 5th character, without considering the possibility that the string might be shorter than that.

Possible approach to fixing the bug: We should first check the length of the `command.script` string before attempting to slice it. If it's shorter than 5 characters, we should handle it gracefully.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if len(command.script) > 5:
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'open http://'
```
