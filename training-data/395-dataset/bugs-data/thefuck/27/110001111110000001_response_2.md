The error occurs because the original function "get_new_command" is not properly extracting the domain from the input command. The function is assuming a fixed length of the input command, which is not the case in all scenarios. This leads to an incorrect output for the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should extract the domain from the input command dynamically, rather than relying on a fixed length. This can be achieved by finding the index of the first space after "open" in the input command, and then extracting the substring from that index to the end of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the "get_new_command" function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    split_command = command.script.split(' ')
    domain = split_command[1]  # The domain is always the second word after 'open'
    return f'open http://{domain}'
```

This updated code uses the split function to separate the command script into individual words, and then extracts the domain from the second word. This approach is more dynamic and will work for any domain length, fixing the bug in the original function.
