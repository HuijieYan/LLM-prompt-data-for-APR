The buggy function is supposed to take a command and settings as input and return a new command. However, the current implementation only works if the command starts with 'open'. If the input command starts with a different value, the function will return an incorrect result.

To fix this, the function needs to check if the command starts with 'open'. If it does, it should return a new command with the correct format. If it doesn't start with 'open', it should return the original command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open'):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```
