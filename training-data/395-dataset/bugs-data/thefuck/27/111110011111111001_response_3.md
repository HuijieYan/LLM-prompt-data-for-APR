Potential error location: The `get_new_command` function is attempting to extract the URL from the `command.script` and concatenate it with the string 'open http://'.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function incorrectly takes a substring from index 5 of the `command.script` instead of using different methods to extract the correct URL.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use regular expressions to find the URL pattern in the `command.script` and construct the new command string accordingly.
- Use string manipulation functions to find the correct position of the URL in the `command.script` and concatenate it with 'open http://'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url_match = re.search(r'(https?://\S+)', command.script)
    if url_match:
        return 'open ' + url_match.group(0)
    else:
        return None  # handle the case where a valid URL is not found
```

In the corrected code, the `re.search` function is used to match the URL pattern in the `command.script`. If a match is found, the `group(0)` method retrieves the matched URL, and it is concatenated with 'open '. If no match is found, the function returns `None`, which can be handled accordingly.
