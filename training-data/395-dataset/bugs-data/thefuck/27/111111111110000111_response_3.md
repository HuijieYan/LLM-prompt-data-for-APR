The function `get_new_command` is supposed to append "http://" to the input command, but the current implementation is incorrect. It simply appends "http://" to the input string without considering the length of the command script.

Looking at the error messages from the test function, we can see that the expected new_command is not being generated correctly for commands that start with "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open". This is due to the incorrect slicing of the input string in the current implementation.

To fix the bug, we need to account for the specific length of the commands "xdg-open", "gnome-open", and "kde-open", instead of using a fixed index for slicing the input command.

Here is the corrected implementation of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmd = command.script.split(' ')[0]
    return f'{cmd} http://{command.script[len(cmd) + 1:]}'
```

This implementation correctly handles commands that start with "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open" by splitting the command and properly adding "http://" to the remaining part of the command script.
