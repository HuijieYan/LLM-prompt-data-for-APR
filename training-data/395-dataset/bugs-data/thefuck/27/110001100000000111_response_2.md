Potential error location: The bug is likely due to the incorrect indexing of the command.script string.

Reasons behind the bug: The function is attempting to extract a portion of the command.script string starting from the 6th character and prefixing it with "open http://". However, the indexing is off by one and should start from the 7th character instead of the 6th.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Adjust the indexing to start from the 7th character of the command.script string.
- Check for edge cases where the command.script might not have enough characters.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if len(command.script) < 6:
        return command
    return 'open http://' + command.script[6:]
```
