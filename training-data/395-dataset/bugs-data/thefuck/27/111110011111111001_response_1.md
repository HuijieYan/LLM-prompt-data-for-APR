The issue with the buggy function is in the way it constructs the new command. It is slicing the text from the 5th character onward, which is incorrect for most cases. It should instead check for the presence of 'foo.' in the command and then append 'http://foo.' to it.

The following is the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if 'foo.' in command.script:
        return 'open http://' + command.script.split(' ')[-1]
    else:
        return command.script
```
