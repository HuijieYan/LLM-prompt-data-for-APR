The buggy function `get_new_command` takes two parameters: `command` and `settings`. It attempts to extract the URL from the `command.script` and prepend it with "open http://". However, it erroneously uses `command.script[5:]` to extract the URL, which leads to incorrect output.

The erroneous output can be attributed to the indexing used to extract the URL. The function assumes that the URL always starts at the 6th character of the `command.script`. This assumption is incorrect, leading to incorrect URLs in the output.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the `command.script` starts with "open ". If it does, it should extract the URL after "open " and then prepend it with "http://".

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        url = command.script[5:]
        return 'open http://' + url
    else:
        # handle other cases or raise an error
        return ''  # or raise an error indicating that the URL couldn't be extracted
```

This amended function checks if the `command.script` starts with "open ". If it does, it extracts the URL by taking the substring after "open " and then appends it to "http://". If the `command.script` does not start with "open ", other cases can be handled as required.
