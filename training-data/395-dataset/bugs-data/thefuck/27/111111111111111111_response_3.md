The buggy function `get_new_command` replaces the string 'open' with 'open http://' in the command script. However, it does not handle cases where the string already starts with 'http'. This results in the incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function blindly assumes that the command.script will always start with 'open' and should be replaced with 'open http://'. However, this assumption does not account for cases where the command.script already starts with 'http'. 

To fix this bug, we need to check if the command.script already starts with 'http', and if so, we should not modify the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```

With this corrected code, when the input command starts with 'http', it will not be modified; otherwise, 'open ' will be replaced with 'open http://'. This fix addresses the bug and ensures that the function behaves as expected for all cases.
