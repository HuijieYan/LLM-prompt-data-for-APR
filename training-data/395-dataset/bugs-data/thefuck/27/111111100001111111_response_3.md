Potential error location: The issue is with the slicing of the `command.script` string, as the function assumes that the URL always starts at the 6th character, which may not be the case.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function assumes the URL always starts at the 6th character of the `command.script` string. Instead, it should determine the start of the URL dynamically.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by dynamically finding the start of the URL in the `command.script` string rather than hardcoding the position.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_27/thefuck/rules/open.py

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url_prefix = 'open '
    url_start_index = command.script.find(url_prefix) + len(url_prefix)
    url = command.script[url_start_index:]
    return 'open http://' + url
```
