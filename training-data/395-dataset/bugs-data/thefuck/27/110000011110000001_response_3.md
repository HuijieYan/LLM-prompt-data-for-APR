The function `get_new_command` takes two parameters: `command` and `settings`. 
The `command` parameter is an object with a property `script`, and the return value of the function should be a string that starts with 'open http://' and then includes everything after the 5th character in the `command.script`.

The issue here is the slicing part of the code: `command.script[5:]`. It seems the intention was to start from the 5th character of the `script` and include everything after it. However, due to the typo 'open' being hard-coded in the return statement, it's not providing the expected result.

The correct approach would be to use string manipulation to replace the 'open' part with 'open http://'. This way, regardless of the content of the command, it would always be prepended with 'open http://'.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return command.script.replace('open', 'open http://')
```

This function uses the `replace` method to replace 'open' with 'open http://'. This ensures that the return value of the function always starts with 'open http://' and then includes the rest of the `command.script`. This approach fixes the bug by correctly modifying the command as per the intended logic.
