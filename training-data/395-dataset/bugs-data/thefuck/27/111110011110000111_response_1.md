The buggy function is `get_new_command(command, settings)`. This function is intended to take a command and return a new command by prepending it with "open http://". 

The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is incorrectly concatenating the strings. The `get_new_command` function returns 'open http://' concatenated with the substring of `command.script` starting from the 5th character (index 4) till the end. However, this is not the correct behavior as it does not account for the different strings to be concatenated.

To fix this bug, the `get_new_command` function should be updated to concatenate the correct substring and return the new command as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return 'open http://' + command.script.split(' ')[1]
```
