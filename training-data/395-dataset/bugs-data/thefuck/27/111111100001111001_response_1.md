The buggy function takes a command and settings as inputs and returns a modified version of the command. It appends "open http://" to the beginning of the command.script string.

The potential error in the function lies in the use of a fixed string index of 5 to slice the command.script. This approach assumes that the command.script will always start with "open " and then contain the URL, which may not always be the case.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the command.script starts with "open " before slicing it to extract the URL. If it does not start with "open ", we should return the original command unchanged.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```

This code checks whether the command starts with "open ". If it does, it appends "open http://" to the URL. If not, it simply returns the original command. This fix ensures that the function handles a wider range of input cases and avoids potential errors.
