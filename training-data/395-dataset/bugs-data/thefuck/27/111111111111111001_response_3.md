The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it is trying to manipulate the `command.script` without checking if it has the expected prefix "open". 

The function is supposed to take the domain out of the command and format it into a URL. However, it makes the assumption that the command always starts with "open", which is not the case for commands like "xdg-open", "gnome-open", and "kde-open". 

To fix this, we need to check if the command starts with "open " and then extract the domain accordingly. If not, we should just return the original command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```
