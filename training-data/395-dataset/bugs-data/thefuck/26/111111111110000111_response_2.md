The `get_new_command` function is supposed to take a command and settings as input and return a new command based on certain conditions. However, the function implementation seems to have a bug.

Based on the error messages, it seems the bug is related to the use of the `shells.and_` function, which does not exist in Python. Additionally, the function should handle both the case when `cmds` has 3 or more elements and when it has less than 3 elements. 

The potential error location is within the line `return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)`.

The buggy function is incorrectly trying to use the `shells.and_` function, but this function does not exist in Python. To fix this issue, we can simply concatenate the strings using the `+` operator.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine + " && " + command.script
```

With this correction, the function will return the expected new command based on the conditions provided in the test cases.
