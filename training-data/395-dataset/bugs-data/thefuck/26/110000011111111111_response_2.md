The bug occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function is intended to split the `command.script` and extract the command to be executed on the virtual machine. However, it is not correctly obtaining the machine name from the input command.

When we examine the buggy function's logic, we can see that it incorrectly constructs the new command to include the machine name. It fails to account for cases where the original command already includes the machine name. Additionally, it erroneously inserts an additional space in the new command, which causes the assertion failures in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of obtaining the machine name from the input command. We also need to ensure that when constructing the new command, we correctly account for cases where the machine name is already included in the original command.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[-1]  # Extract the machine name from the last element
        return 'vagrant up ' + machine + ' && ' + command.script  # Construct the new command

    return 'vagrant up && ' + command.script  # If machine name is not present, construct the new command without it
```

By making these changes, the function now correctly constructs the new command based on the input command script and machine name. The corrected function should pass the provided test cases without raising any assertion errors.
