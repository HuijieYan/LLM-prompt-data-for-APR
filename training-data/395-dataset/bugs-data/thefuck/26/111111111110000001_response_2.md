The problematic function is `get_new_command`. The error messages indicate that the function is not correctly handling the input `command`. It is currently splitting the input command by spaces and then using the third token as the name of the virtual machine to bring up. However, the test cases show that this is not always the case. For example, in the second test case, the input command is 'vagrant ssh devbox', and the function incorrectly assumes that 'devbox' should be used as the name of the machine to bring up. 

To fix this, the function should check the first word of the input command to see if it's "vagrant". If it is, then it should return the input command. Otherwise, it should add "vagrant up" before the input command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('vagrant'):
        return command.script
    else:
        return 'vagrant up && ' + command.script
```
