The function `get_new_command` takes a `command` and `settings` as input and then splits the `command.script`. It aims to return a new command where "vagrant up" is added before the original command. 

The main issue is that it concatenates the "vagrant up" and the split command without handling issues such as spaces. This results in errors for certain inputs as the expected new command doesn't match with the actual new command.

To resolve the issue, the function needs to handle spaces properly and concatenate the strings correctly to form a valid command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {' '.join(cmds[2:])}"
```
