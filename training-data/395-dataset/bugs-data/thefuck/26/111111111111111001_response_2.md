The bug in the provided function is the use of `shells.and_`, which is not a recognized function in Python. Additionally, the logic for constructing the new command is incorrect.

The main issue lies in the function `get_new_command`, where the intention is to extract the machine name from the command and then construct a new command with "vagrant up" followed by the original command being run. The buggy function did not correctly handle the case when a machine name is provided in the command.

The correct approach here is to identify whether the command is "vagrant up" or not. If it is, the function should simply return the original command script. If it's not, then construct a new command with "vagrant up" followed by the original command script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3 and cmds[1] == "up":
        return command.script
    else:
        return "vagrant up && " + command.script
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the command is already "vagrant up". If it is, the original command script is returned. Otherwise, the "vagrant up" command is prepended to the original command script.

This should resolve the issue and align with the expected behavior described in the test cases.
