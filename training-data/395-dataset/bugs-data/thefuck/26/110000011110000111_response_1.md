The error occurs when the `get_new_command` function is tested using the provided test cases. The function `get_new_command` performs the split operation on `command.script` using the space delimiter and then assigns the third element to the variable `machine`. Later, it attempts to construct a new command using the `vagrant up` and machine values. 

The given buggy function has an issue with the construction of the new command. The problem is that it appends the 'vagrant up' command and the machine name with a space, but the correct syntax is to have an '&&' operator between these two commands.

To fix this issue, the buggy function needs to modify the command construction by adding the '&&' operator between 'vagrant up' and the machine name. Additionally, it should handle the case where machine name is not present, for example, when `cmds` list does not contain the third element.

Below is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    if machine:
        return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
    else:
        return f"vagrant up && {command.script}"
```
