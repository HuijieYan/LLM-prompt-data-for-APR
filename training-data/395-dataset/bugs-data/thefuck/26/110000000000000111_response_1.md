The potential error in the given function is that 'shells.and_' seems to be a non-existent function. It should probably be 'shlex.join' instead.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import shlex

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = shlex.split(command.script)
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine + " " + ' '.join(cmds)
```
