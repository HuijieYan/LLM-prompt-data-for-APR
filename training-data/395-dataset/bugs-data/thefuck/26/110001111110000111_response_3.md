The potential error in the provided function `get_new_command` is that it is not properly handling the case where the length of `cmds` is less than 3. This causes issues when trying to access `cmds[2]` because it may not exist.

The error messages are showing that the actual output of the function is not matching the expected output.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `get_new_command` function to handle the case where the length of `cmds` is less than 3. We can also change `shells.and_` to `subprocess.Popen` for executing the correct command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import subprocess

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    cmd = f"vagrant up {machine}"
    if machine:
        cmd += f" && {command.script}"
    return cmd
```

By making these changes, the function will now handle cases where the length of `cmds` is less than 3 and correctly build the new command to be executed.
