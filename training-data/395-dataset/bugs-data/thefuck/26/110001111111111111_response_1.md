The bug is likely located in the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to extract the machine name from the command script and then return a new command using the `vagrant up` command.

The bug occurs because the `shells.and_` method is used incorrectly. Additionally, the machine name is not being handled properly when it's present in the command script. This is causing the test cases to fail.

The potential approaches for fixing the bug could involve using the correct function to concatenate the commands instead of `shells.and_` and properly handling the machine name when it's present in the command script.

The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function would be:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine}" if machine else "vagrant up"
```

This fixes the incorrect usage of `shells.and_` and properly handles the machine name when it's present in the command script.
