Error:
The function is attempting to split the `command.script` using a space and then retrieve the machine name. However, this approach fails when the `command.script` contains more than three words, as it only considers the third word as the machine name. 

Correction:
1. Split the `command.script` based on spaces.
2. Check if the split list contains 'up' and use the index of 'up' to extract the machine name.
3. If 'up' is not present, set the `machine` variable to an empty string.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if 'up' in cmds:
        machine = cmds[cmds.index('up') - 1]
    return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
```
