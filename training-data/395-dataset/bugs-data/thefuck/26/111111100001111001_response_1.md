The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to split the input command and extract the machine name if present, then use that name to run a new command. However, the current implementation is not working correctly for certain cases.

The `machine` variable is set to the third element in the `cmds` list, but if the input command is `'vagrant ssh'` or `'vagrant rdp'`, then there is no machine name specified. In these cases, the `machine` variable should be an empty string.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of `cmds` is sufficient to extract the machine name. If it is, we'll assign the machine name; otherwise, we'll leave it as an empty string.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = "" if len(cmds) < 3 else cmds[2]
    return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
```
