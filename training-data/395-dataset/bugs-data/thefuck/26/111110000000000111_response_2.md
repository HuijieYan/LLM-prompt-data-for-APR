Potential error location: 
The error is likely located in the line `return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)`, where `shells.and_` seems to be used in an incorrect way.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might have occurred due to the incorrect usage of the `shells.and_` function. It seems like the intention was to concatenate the "vagrant up" command with the machine name and then with the original command script, but the usage of `shells.and_` is incorrect here.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use simple string concatenation to achieve the desired result.
- Use the appropriate function from the shells module, if such a function exists for this purpose.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine + " " + command.script
```
