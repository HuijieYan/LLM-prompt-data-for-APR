The bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to the concatenation of the command strings based on the provided input. The function fails to handle the condition when the `machine` variable is empty. The buggy code also incorrectly uses `shells.and_` instead of Python's `and` operator.

Based on the test cases and the error messages, the bug is mainly related to the concatenation of the command strings, especially when `machine` is empty or not specified.

To fix the bug, the `machine` variable should be used in the concatenation of the commands only when it is not empty. Additionally, the use of Python's `and` operator should replace `shells.and_`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    
    if machine:
        return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
    else:
        return f"vagrant up && {command.script}"
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle the different scenarios when constructing the new command based on the input.
