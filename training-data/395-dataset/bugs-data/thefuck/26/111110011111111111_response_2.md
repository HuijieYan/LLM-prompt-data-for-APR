The buggy function `get_new_command` seems to have several issues:

1. The function seems to be trying to split the command script into individual words to identify the machine name.
2. The function combines `vagrant up` with the machine name and the original command script, which is possibly trying to concatenate these commands. However, it does not appear to handle all cases correctly, as seen from the test errors.

The potential errors could be related to how the machine name is extracted and how the commands are combined.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle all cases correctly and produce the expected result. The corrected function is shown below:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    start_instances = "vagrant up"
    new_command = command.script

    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
        start_instances += " " + machine
    return f"{start_instances} && {new_command}"
```

This corrected function addresses the issues in the original function by properly handling the machine name and combining the commands to form the new command. The corrected function uses an f-string to build the combined command, ensuring the correct spacing and arrangement of the commands.
