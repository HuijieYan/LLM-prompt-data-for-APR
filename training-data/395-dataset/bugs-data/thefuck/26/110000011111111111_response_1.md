The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to split the input `command.script` and store it in the `cmds` variable. It then attempts to extract the value corresponding to the machine when it exists in the `cmds` list and returns a new command using the `shells.and_` function.

From the error messages, it seems that the problem lies in the way the buggy function constructs the new command. It fails to properly handle cases where the `machine` is empty or when it should be appended to the `vagrant up` command.

The buggy function fails to consider edge cases where the `machine` may or may not be available in the `command.script`. When the `machine` is not present, it results in the generation of erroneous commands.

To fix the function, we need to first identify if the `machine` is available in the `command.script`, and then construct the new command accordingly. Additionally, we should address the issue regarding the extra space before the `&&` operator, as seen in the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
        idx = command.script.find(machine)
        return " && ".join(['vagrant up ' + machine, command.script[:idx]+command.script[idx+len(machine):]])
    else:
        return "vagrant up && " + command.script
```

In this corrected version, we properly address edge cases where the `machine` is not present in the `command.script`, and construct the new command accordingly, removing any unnecessary spaces around the `&&` operator.
