The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to split a command by spaces and extract the third element as the machine name from a specific pattern. It then concatenates this machine name with the 'vagrant up' command and the original command. However, it seems the intention was to use a library or module that is not defined in the code, as `shells` and `and_` are not previously mentioned as part of the imports or the external dependencies.

The potential error location is the usage of `shells.and_()`. It seems that this is a custom function or a function from another library that is not defined in the given code.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the correct library or module for concatenating the commands and to define the required functionality as a custom function if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    startAllInstances = f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
    return startAllInstances
```
