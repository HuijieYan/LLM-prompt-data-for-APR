Potential error location: The buggy line of code is `return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)`.

Reason for bug: The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the `shells.and_` function, and the incorrect concatenation of the command.

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to properly format the new command and return it as a string.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine
```
