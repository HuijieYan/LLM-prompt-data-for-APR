The provided function splits the command script by spaces and then tries to form a new command using the 'vagrant up' command with the machine name and the original command script. It seems that the logic is flawed and does not generate the expected new command as shown in the error messages.

The above test cases demonstrate the failure to generate the expected modified command for various input commands. The error messages indicate that the new command generated by the function does not match the expected new command.

The bug occurs because the 'shells.and_' method is used incorrectly. The correct usage for concatenating shell commands in Python would be to use the '&' character to separate the commands.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the 'get_new_command' function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return 'vagrant up ' + machine + ' && ' + command.script
```
