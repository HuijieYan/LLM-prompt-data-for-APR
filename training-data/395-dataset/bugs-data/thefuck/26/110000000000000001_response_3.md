Potential error location:
The potential error is in the line `return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)`, where `shells.and_` seems to be a wrong function call.

Reason for the bug:
The `shells.and_` function call is not a standard Python function, which is causing the error. It seems like the intention is to concatenate the "vagrant up" command with the `machine` variable.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can simply concatenate the "vagrant up" command with the `machine` variable using the `+` operator.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine + " " + command.script
```
