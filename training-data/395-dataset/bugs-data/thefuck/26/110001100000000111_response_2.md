Potential error location:
The potential error is in the line "return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)", where the "shells.and_" function seems to be incorrectly used. It seems like the intention is to concatenate the "vagrant up" command with the machine name and return it.

Reason behind the bug:
The "shells.and_" function is not the correct way to concatenate strings in Python, hence it is causing the bug. Additionally, the use of "command.script" in the return statement does not seem to be necessary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct string concatenation method in Python, such as using the "+" operator or the ".join()" method.
2. Remove the unnecessary "command.script" from the return statement.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine
```
