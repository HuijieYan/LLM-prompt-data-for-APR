Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the return statement where the 'shells.and_' method is being used. It seems that the 'shells.and_' method is not a built-in Python method, as it is not recognized by the Python interpreter.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The use of an undefined method 'shells.and_' is causing the bug. This method is likely intended to concatenate the two commands 'vagrant up' and 'vagrant ssh', but there is no built-in method in Python called 'shells.and_'. It seems like the intention might have been to use logical 'and' operator to combine the two commands.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the '+' operator to concatenate the two commands 'vagrant up' and 'vagrant ssh'.
2. Use the string formatting method to concatenate the two commands.
3. Consider using an external library if the intention was to use a custom method for combining shell commands.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine + " && " + command.script
```
