Potential Error Location: 
The buggy function "get_new_command" is incorrectly using undefined function "shells.and_" and the return statement is also incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy function is trying to use a function "shells.and_" which is not defined in the buggy function or anywhere else in the code. Additionally, the return statement is trying to concatenate a string with the "vagrant up" command and the original command script, which is not the expected behavior according to the comments provided in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the logical operator "and" instead of "shells.and_" for combining commands.
2. Correctly separate the "vagrant up" command and the original command script in the return statement.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    # Combine commands using 'and' operator
    startAllInstances = "vagrant up " + machine + " && " + command.script
    return startAllInstances
```
