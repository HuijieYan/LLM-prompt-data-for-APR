The bug is located in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line that constructs the new command.

The buggy function splits the `command.script` into a list of strings using the space character and then attempts to access the element at index 2 (cmds[2]) to obtain the machine name. If the length of cmds is less than 3, the `machine` variable is left blank. The new command is then constructed by combining "vagrant up " with the obtained machine name and the original `command.script`.

The bug occurs because the "vagrant up " part of the new command is hardcoded into the function, which does not account for different cases where the machine name might be missing or included in the original command. Additionally, the function uses a `shells.and_()` method which is not a standard Python method, and it appears to be intended to join the commands together with an '&&' operator.

To fix this bug, we can use Python's string formatting to construct the new command and use the logical AND operator '&&' to join the commands together.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    new_command = f"vagrant up {'&& ' + machine if machine else ''} && {command.script}"
    return new_command
```
