The potential error in the given code is that the `command` object does not have a property called `script`, which is being used in the `get_new_command` function.

The `command` object may have a different property name that contains the actual command script to be executed.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to use the correct property name for the command script.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    machine = ""
    if len(command.split(' ')) >= 3:
        machine = command.split(' ')[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine + " && " + command
```
