The issue with the `get_new_command` function is the use of `shells.and_` which is not defined in the code provided. Additionally, there are also issues in extracting the machine name from the `command.script` for the cases when the script contains more than one word.

To fix the code, we need to properly extract the machine name from the command and then concatenate it with the "vagrant up" command. We can use the `shutil.which` function to check if the needed command exists in the system.

After analyzing the requirements and the buggy code, the corrected function is provided below:

```python
import shutil

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3 and cmds[1] == "up":  # Check for "up" command
        machine = cmds[-1]
    elif len(cmds) == 3 and cmds[1] == "ssh" and shutil.which("vagrant"):  # Check for "ssh" command
        return "vagrant up && " + command.script
    elif len(cmds) == 3 and cmds[1] == "rdp" and shutil.which("vagrant"):  # Check for "rdp" command
        return "vagrant up && " + command.script

    return "vagrant up " + machine + " && " + command.script  # Concatenate with "up" command if machine exists
```

In this corrected function, we first split the command script and extract the machine name properly. We then check if the command is "up", "ssh", or "rdp" and concatenate the appropriate commands. If the "up" command is detected within the command script, we directly use the provided command. If the "ssh" or "rdp" commands are detected, we check for the existence of the "vagrant" command using `shutil.which` and then concatenate the "up" command accordingly.

This corrected function should fix the issues with the buggy function and enable the test cases to pass successfully.
