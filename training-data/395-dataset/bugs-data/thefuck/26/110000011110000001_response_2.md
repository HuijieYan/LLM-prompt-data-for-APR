The problem with the `get_new_command` function is that it is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter directly and then splitting it on spaces. However, the `command` parameter is of type `Command` and does not have a `script` attribute. It seems it should be accessing the `command`'s `script` attribute directly, not `command.script`.

To fix this function, we should modify the two lines referencing the `command` object to directly access its `script` attribute.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command)
```

The reason behind the bug is a simple misunderstanding of how to access attributes of the `Command` object.

The potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Accessing the `script` attribute correctly from the `Command` object.
2. Ensuring that the `command` object passed to the function is of the correct type and has the expected attributes.

By following these approaches, we can ensure that the function works as intended and does not throw any errors.
