The potential error in the buggy function is with the use of `shells.and_()` function, which is not a standard Python function and could be causing the error.

The bug occurs because the `shells.and_()` function used in the buggy code is not a standard Python function. It seems like the intended functionality is to concatenate the strings 'vagrant up ' and the content of the `machine` variable, along with the original command script. However, this is not the correct way to achieve this in Python.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to use the standard string concatenation and also handle the cases where the 'machine' variable is empty or contains a value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
        if machine:
            return 'vagrant up ' + machine + ' && ' + command.script
        else:
            return 'vagrant up && ' + command.script
    else:
        return command.script
```
