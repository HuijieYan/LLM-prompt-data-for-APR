The bug in the provided function occurs because the code attempts to access a property `command.script` which does not exist. Instead, it should be `command`. This is because `command` is an instance of the `Command` class, which has a property `script`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return machine if cmds[0] == 'vagrant' else ''
```
