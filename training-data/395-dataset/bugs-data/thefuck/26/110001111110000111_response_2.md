The buggy function `get_new_command` takes a command and settings as input and is expected to return a new command based on certain conditions. In the provided test cases, different commands and their expected new commands are being tested.

The potential error is located in the `get_new_command` function where the incorrect concatenation of commands is leading to the test failures.

Looking at the test cases and the error messages, it seems that the buggy function is failing to produce the expected new commands as per the provided input commands. For example, in the first test case of the `test_get_new_command` function, the expected new command is 'vagrant up && vagrant ssh', but the actual result is 'vagrant up  && vagrant ssh'. This indicates that there is a problem with how the new command is being generated by the 'get_new_command' function.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function should concatenate the commands correctly by using the '&&' operator in a valid manner and handling the case where the machine name is provided in the command.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return 'vagrant up ' +  machine + ' && ' + command.script
```

In this corrected code, the '&&' operator is used to concatenate the commands properly, and the machine name is included in the new command if available. This should address the issues observed in the test cases and resolve the bug.
