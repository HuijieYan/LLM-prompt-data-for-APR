The potential error in the function "get_new_command" is on the line "return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)".

The reason for the bug is that the "shells.and_" function is not defined, which causes the function to fail.

To fix this bug, the "shells.and_" function should be replaced with the appropriate logic to concatenate and format the commands correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the "get_new_command" function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
```
