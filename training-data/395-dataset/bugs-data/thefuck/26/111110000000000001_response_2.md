Potential error location: 
The variable "command" is used as if it has a property called "script", which suggests that "command" is an object with a "script" property. However, in the given code, "command" is treated as a string, which does not have a "script" property.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The "command" parameter is being used as an object in some places (command.script), and as a string in others (cmds = command.script.split(' ')). This inconsistency causes a bug in the code.
2. There is no error handling for cases where the command does not have a script property.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function signature to accept an object with a "script" property instead of a string.
2. Add error handling to check if the "script" property exists on the "command" object.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if hasattr(command, 'script'):
        cmds = command.script.split(' ')
        machine = ""
        if len(cmds) >= 3:
            machine = cmds[2]
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
    else:
        return "Invalid command"
```
