Potential Error Location:
The issue lies in the `get_new_command` function. Specifically, the problem is with the `shells.and_` method application.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The `shells.and_` method is used incorrectly. It should actually be used to chain multiple shell commands together. The current implementation is incorrect and doesn't account for the situations where the machine part is already present in the command.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `machine` value is empty or not, and accordingly concatenate the strings in the `shells.and_` method.
2. Ensure that the correct value is being placed within the `shells.and_` method to form the desired new command.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    
    if machine:
        return 'vagrant up ' + machine + ' && ' + command.script
    else:
        return 'vagrant up && ' + command.script
```
