The bug occurs in the function `get_new_command`. The function splits the input command by spaces and then uses the third entry as the machine name to be passed to "vagrant up". However, if the machine name is not provided in the original command, the logic to get the machine name fails and it results in an error.

The error is occurring because the implemented logic doesn't handle cases where the machine name is not provided in the original command.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the machine name is provided in the original command. If it is not provided, the function should simply return the original command concatenated with "vagrant up".

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    if machine:
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)
    else:
        return shells.and_("vagrant up", command.script)
```

With this correction, the function will check if the machine name is available. If it is, it will concatenate "vagrant up" with the machine name. Otherwise, it will append "vagrant up" to the original command. This should resolve the bug.
