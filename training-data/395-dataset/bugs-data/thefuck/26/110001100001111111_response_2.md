The bug in the function `get_new_command` is that it tries to call `command.script.split(' ')` even when `command.script` does not contain any spaces. This leads to an IndexError when trying to access `cmds[2]` later in the function.

To fix this bug, we can first split `command.script` only if it contains a space. Otherwise, we can directly set `machine` to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    if ' ' in command.script:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
```

This approach ensures that `machine` is set to an empty string when there are no spaces in the `command.script`.
