The buggy function `get_new_command` has several issues that need to be addressed. The function attempts to split the `command.script` into a list using whitespace as the delimiter, but it then fails to correctly capture the required machine name in some cases. Additionally, the usage of `shells.and_` seems incorrect. The issue seems to be caused by mishandling of the `command` and `settings` parameters and the logic for joining the strings.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to use a conditional assignment for extracting the machine name and use string formatting to build the `startAllInstances` string. We also need to correct the handling of the `command` and `settings` parameters in the function signature.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = cmds[-1] if len(cmds) > 2 else ''
    startAllInstances = f"vagrant up {' '.join(cmds[2:])} && {command.script}"
    return startAllInstances
```

In this fixed code, we extract the machine name by checking the length of `cmds` and use string formatting to build the `startAllInstances` string. We also simplified the logic for extracting the machine name.

After making these changes, the tests should pass without any assertion errors.
