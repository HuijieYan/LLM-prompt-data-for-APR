The error occurs because the `match` function is using the `_search` method, but based on the error message and the test case, it seems that the `_search` method is not defined.

There are a couple of potential reasons for this bug:
1. The `_search` method may not have been imported or defined within the same module as the `match` function.
2. It's possible that the `_search` method is from an external module, and the `match` function is not invoking it correctly.

To fix the bug, the `_search` method needs to be properly defined or imported within the `match` function, or a suitable alternative needs to be used. 

Here's the corrected `match` function:
```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and 'ERROR' in command.stderr
```

In this corrected version, the `_search` method has been removed, and the presence of an error in the command's stderr is checked directly.

If the `_search` method is from an external module, make sure to import it correctly or use an alternative method provided by that module.
