The issue with the `match` function is that it checks if the 'EDITOR' environment variable is present in `os.environ`, but it does not use the `settings` parameter at all. The function also references an undefined `_search` function. 

To fix the function, we need to use the `settings` parameter in some way or remove it if it is unnecessary. Additionally, if the intention was to call a `_search` function, it needs to be defined or imported.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r'error|syntax|command not found', command.stderr)
```
