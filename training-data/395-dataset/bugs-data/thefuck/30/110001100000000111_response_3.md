Potential error location: The match function has incorrect indentation which leads to the function being defined inside _search function, causing a syntax error.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The match function is not properly indented, causing it to be defined inside the _search function and leading to a syntax error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Correct the indentation of the match function so that it is defined outside of the _search function.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
