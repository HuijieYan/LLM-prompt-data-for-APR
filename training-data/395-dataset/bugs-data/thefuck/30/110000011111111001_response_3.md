The main issue with the `match` function is that it fails to import the necessary module `re`. This results in the `_search` method not being identified, causing the function to fail.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(command.stderr)
```
