The function is returning an object of type 're.Match' when an assertion of this type should not be present.

Here is the fixed function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
