The problematic function is the `match` function, which takes a `command` and `settings` as input and checks if a specific environment variable is present, and then calls the `_search` function with the `stderr` attribute of the `command`. The `_search` function is not provided in the code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug seems to be the incorrect implementation of the `match` function, as well as the absence of the `_search` function.

To fix the bug, ensure that the `match` function correctly checks for the environment variable and handles the `stderr` attribute of the `command`. Additionally, implement the `_search` function to process the `stderr` attribute.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function, assuming `_search` is implemented:

```python
# Updated match function
def match(command, settings):
    import os  # assuming that the os import is needed here

    def _search(stderr):
        # ... implementation of the search logic ...

    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```

If the `_search` function implementation is provided and is meant to be a separate utility function, it should be implemented as a separate function in the codebase. However, the code provided does not include the `_search` function, so its implementation is assumed when fixing the `match` function.
