The issue with the provided function `match` is that it includes an incorrect logic related to the checking of the presence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable and the call to the `_search` function. This results in the test cases failing due to incorrect matches being produced.

The potential error location is the `match` function, particularly in the logic for checking the 'EDITOR' environment variable and calling the `_search` function.

The bug occurred because the 'EDITOR' environment variable check was incorrect and the `_search` function call was not being used properly.

To fix the bug, the 'EDITOR' environment variable check should be performed using the `os.getenv` method, and the `_search` function needs to be invoked correctly by passing the `stderr` as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return os.getenv('EDITOR') is not None and _search(command)
```

By making the above changes, the `match` function should work correctly and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
