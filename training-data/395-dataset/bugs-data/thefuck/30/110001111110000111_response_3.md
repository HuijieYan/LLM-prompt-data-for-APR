The buggy function `match` seems to be trying to determine whether an environment variable 'EDITOR' is present and if a certain condition involving the `stderr` parameter is met. However, it looks like the implementation of the `match` function is incorrect, leading to various assertion errors in the test cases.

The implementation of the `match` function is causing errors in the test cases because it should check for the presence of an environment variable named 'EDITOR' and the 'stderr' parameter. However, the original implementation seems to be incorrect in handling the `stderr` parameter and does not properly account for the contents of the variable.

To fix this bug, the `match` function should be modified to properly handle the 'stderr' parameter and accurately check for the presence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable.

Below is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os

def match(stderr):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and stderr is not None and 'expected expression' in stderr
```

In this corrected implementation, we are checking for the presence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable and ensuring that the 'stderr' parameter is not None, and also contains the specific text 'expected expression'. This should address the issues present in the original implementation and make the function more reliable for the given test cases.
