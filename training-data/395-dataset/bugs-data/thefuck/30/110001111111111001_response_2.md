The error occurs in the `match` function, which tries to find the presence of an environment variable (`EDITOR`) in `os.environ` and searches for a given pattern in the `stderr` attribute of the `Command` object. The function returns a string, but in the test cases, it is returning a regular expression match object. This mismatch leads to the assertion errors.

The `match` function should be modified to correctly return a boolean value based on the search result using the regular expression. Specifically, the `re.search` function should be used to perform the search, and its return value should be appropriately handled to return the expected boolean result.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
import re

def _search(stderr):
    pattern = r'error|syntax|unexpected|invalid|not found'
    return re.search(pattern, stderr, re.IGNORECASE) is not None

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
