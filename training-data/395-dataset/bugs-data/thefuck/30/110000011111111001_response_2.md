The buggy function seems to be using the `_search` function from an unknown source. It is also missing the import statement for the `os` module. Additionally, the match function is returning a boolean value, while it is expected to return a boolean expression that checks for a match with the input command's stderr.

The reason for the bug is that the function is missing both the `_search` function and the import statement for the `os` module, which causes failure in returning a boolean expression to check for a match.

To fix the bug, we need to include the import statement for the `os` module and define the `_search` function or use a built-in method like `re.search` to perform the string search.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r'\nerror:', command.stderr) is not None
```
