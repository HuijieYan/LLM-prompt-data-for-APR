The bug in the provided function is that the function is checking for the existence of 'EDITOR' in the environment variables, but it is not using the 'settings' parameter anywhere. Additionally, the use of the '_search' function is not provided.

To fix the bug, the function should consider the 'settings' parameter and modify the logic accordingly.

```python
import os

# Updated function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r'error', command.stderr)
```
