The problem in the provided code is the indentation of the `match` function. It is defined inside another function `_search`, which is incorrect.

The error occurs because the `match` function is not being called correctly with the appropriate parameters.

To fix the issue, the `match` function should be defined outside of the `_search` function. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Corrected match function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)

# Variable runtime value and type should be checked to align with the corrected function.
```

This should resolve the issue with the function and make it callable with the appropriate parameters.
