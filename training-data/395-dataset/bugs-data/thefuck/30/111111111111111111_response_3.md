The buggy function `match` seems to contain a logic error in its implementation. The function is intended to check if the environment variable 'EDITOR' is present and then call the `_search` function to search for a specific pattern in the command's stderr attribute. However, it's not handling the return value of the `_search` function correctly. The return value of `_search` is a regular expression match object, and the function is returning the match object directly instead of checking if the `_search` function has found a match.

Here's the explanation of the buggy function and suggestions for the fix:
- The match function should ensure that the _search function returns a match object, and if it does, then return True.
- If the _search function returns None or no match object, then the match function should return False.
- The regex match object should be checked with an if condition to return True or False accordingly.

Below is the corrected match function:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and bool(_search(command.stderr))
```

In this revised implementation, I used the `bool()` function to convert the return value of the `_search` function, which will check if the value is a match object and return True, otherwise it will return False. This ensures that the match function will correctly handle the return value of the `_search` function and return True or False based on whether a match is found.
