Potential error location: The issue is with the `_search` function being called inside the `match` function. The `_search` function is not implemented and is likely meant to contain the logic for searching the error message for specific patterns.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is incomplete and the functionality of the `_search` function is missing. This creates a bug when the `match` function is called and tries to use the `_search` function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement the logic for the `_search` function to search for specific patterns in the error message. This may involve using regular expressions to match error patterns.
2. Update the `match` function to properly utilize the `stderr` parameter and the `_search` function's logic to determine whether 'EDITOR' is present in the environment.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import os
import re

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # Implement logic for searching specific patterns in the error message
    error_patterns = ['expected expression', 'command not found', 'syntax error']
    for pattern in error_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, stderr):
            return True
    return False

# Updated `match` function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
