The buggy function is `match`, which is checking if the environment variable 'EDITOR' is present and if the `_search` function returns anything for the given `command.stderr`.

Looking at the error messages from the test cases, it seems the `match` function is returning a match object when it's expected to return `False` based on the assertion `assert not match(...)`. The returned match object represents a successful search of the pattern in the `command.stderr`, which is not the intended behavior.

The potential error location is in the `match` function, where the `_search` function is being utilized to check for a pattern in `command.stderr`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_search` function is not returning a boolean value as expected by the `match` function.

To fix the bug, the `_search` function should return `True` if the pattern is found in `command.stderr` and `False` if it's not found.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:
```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)

# Corrected _search function
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    return True if re.search(pattern, stderr) else False
```
