The problematic function is called "match" and it takes two parameters: "command" and "settings". It seems like this function is checking for the existence of a particular environment variable and performing a search operation. However, there are multiple issues with this function that need to be addressed.

Looking at the error messages, it appears that the "match" function is returning a regular expression match object instead of the expected boolean value. This indicates that the function is not performing the expected check and returning the wrong type of value.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error is likely in the _search() operation within the match function. It seems that the return statement of the match function is using this _search() function, which may be the source of the issue.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The match function is not correctly performing the environment variable check in os.environ.
2. It's not properly handling the search operation and returning the result.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the code to properly check for the existence of the environment variable. Use the 'settings' parameter if it includes information for this check.
2. Ensure that the search operation (_search) returns a boolean value instead of a match object.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    if 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
In the corrected code:
- We first check for the existence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable using os.environ.
- Then we use the _search() function to perform the search operation.
- Finally, we return a boolean value based on the result of the environment variable check and the search operation.
