The problem in the `match` function is that it is returning a regular expression match object instead of a boolean value. This is causing the test cases to fail.

One potential reason for this bug is that the `_search` function is being called with `command.stderr` as an argument, which is then being returned in the `match` function. This leads to the match object being returned instead of a boolean value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to return a boolean value based on the result of the `_search` function.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and bool(_search(command.stderr))
```

In this corrected function, we are using the `bool` function to convert the result of the `_search` function to a boolean value, which will ensure that the `match` function returns a boolean as expected.

This should fix the bug and make the test cases pass.
