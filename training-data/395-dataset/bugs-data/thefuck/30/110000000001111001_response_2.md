The bug in the provided function is that it is checking for the 'EDITOR' environment variable in the os module, but the variable 'os' is not imported in the function. Also, the function uses an undefined `_search` function.

To fix this bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Import the os module at the beginning of the file.
2. Replace the `_search` function with the appropriate search function, possibly using regular expressions as indicated by the variable `m` in the function.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r'pattern', command.stderr) is not None
```
