The error is occurring due to the mismatch between the assertion in the test function and the actual output from the `match` function. This indicates that the `match` function is not returning the expected value.

The potential error location within the `match` function is the condition `return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)`. The `_search` function seems to be missing or defined incorrectly, causing a problem with the overall logic of the `match` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_search` function is not defined, and there is no call to it within the `match` function. This makes the condition `return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)` always evaluate to `False`.

To fix the bug, first, the `_search` function needs to be defined or removed. Since it is not being used in the `match` function, it can be removed. Then, the condition in the `match` function should be modified to check for the presence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly check for the presence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable and return a boolean value accordingly.
