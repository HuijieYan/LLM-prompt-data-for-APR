Potential error location: The `_search` function is not defined in the provided code, so it should be replaced with `re.search` to use the `search` function from the `re` module.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is attempting to use a function `_search` which is not defined anywhere in the provided code. It seems the intention was to use the `re.search` function from the `re` module to search for a pattern in the `command.stderr`.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug: Replace the `_search` function with `re.search` to utilize the `search` function provided by the `re` module.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(command.stderr)
```
