The problem with the given function is that it is only checking for the existence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable and does not utilize the 'command.stderr' to match against any pattern.

To fix this, we can use the '_search' function to check for specific patterns in the 'command.stderr' and return a Boolean value based on the result.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r'error|syntax error|command not found|unexpected token', command.stderr)
```
