The potential error in the provided function is that the `os` module is not imported, so the `os.environ` is not accessible.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to access `os.environ` without importing the `os` module.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `os` module at the beginning of the file. Then we can use the `os.environ` to check for the 'EDITOR' environment variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os # import the os module

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```

By importing the `os` module, we can now access the `os.environ` and fix the bug in the `match` function.
