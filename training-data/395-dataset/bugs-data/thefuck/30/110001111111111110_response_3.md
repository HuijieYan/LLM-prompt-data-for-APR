The `match` function is incorrectly checking for a `re.Match` object. The following is the correct way to fix it so that it returns a boolean value, which is more suitable for the test conversion. 

You can update the `match` function as follows:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and bool(re.search(r'.*error:.*', command.stderr))
``` 

With the updated function, the test function should work as expected.
