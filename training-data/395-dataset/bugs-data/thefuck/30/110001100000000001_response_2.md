The `match` function is checking if the environment variable 'EDITOR' is present and if the `_search` function returns a truthy value. However, there are a few issues with this function:
1. The function is missing the import statement for the `os` module, so the usage of `os.environ` will raise an error.
2. The function is not receiving the `command` parameter nor is it using the `settings` parameter.

To fix this function, we need to import the `os` module and include the `command` and `settings` parameters in the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os  # Import the os module

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# Fix the buggy function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
