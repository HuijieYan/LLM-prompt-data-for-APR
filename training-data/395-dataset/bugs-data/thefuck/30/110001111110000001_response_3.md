The error in the `match` function is causing the test cases to fail. The `match` function currently checks if the environment variable `EDITOR` is present and then calls `_search` function with `command.stderr`. However, the `_search` function is not returning any value, so the `match` function always returns `False`.

To fix this, we need to implement the `_search` function so that it performs the actual search in the `stderr` and returns a boolean value whether the search was successful or not. Then, the `match` function can check if `EDITOR` is present and if the search using `_search` function returns `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` and `_search` functions:

```python
import os  # Make sure os module is imported

def _search(stderr):
    # Perform the search in the stderr and return True if found, False otherwise
    # Example search logic:
    return 'error' in stderr.lower()

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```

In this corrected code, the `_search` function checks for the occurrence of the word "error" in the `stderr` and returns `True` if found, `False` otherwise. The `match` function then checks if the environment variable `EDITOR` is present and if the search using `_search` function returns `True`, indicating that an error was found in the `stderr`.
