Potential error location: The function is trying to access a variable `os` and a method `_search` which are not defined within the function.

Reason behind the bug: The function is using `os` and `_search` without importing `os` and defining `_search` method within the function, causing a NameError and AttributeError.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `os` module.
2. Define the `_search` method within the function or use any other appropriate method based on the requirement.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    def _search(stderr):
        # define the _search function here or use any other appropriate function
        pass
        
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
