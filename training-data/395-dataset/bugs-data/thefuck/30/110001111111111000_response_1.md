The function provided has a buggy code to be fixed. It is hard to deduce the exact code to be replaced without understanding the entire structure. However, some parts of the function can be identified from the test cases.

## Fix to be applied:

```python
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr) is not None
```
In the provided function, the `match` function is comparing an integer with None value. The fixed implementation uses the `is not None` statement to check if _search is returning a valid value or otherwise.

This fix will change the output to True or False based on the returned value of `_search`.
