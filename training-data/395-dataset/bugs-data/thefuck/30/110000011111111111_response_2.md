The error in the given function is that it always returns a match object without any conditional logic. This results in failing assertions in the test cases, as the expected behavior is to not have a match in some cases.

The reason behind the bug is that the `match` function always returns a match object without considering the actual content of the `command.stderr`. This behavior is incorrect because the function should match the output against a specific pattern and return an appropriate value based on the match.

To fix this bug, the `match` function should be modified to include actual matching logic. It should check for specific patterns in the `command.stderr` and return True or False based on the match.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    pattern = r'error|exception|fatal'  # Define the pattern to be matched
    return re.search(pattern, command.stderr) is not None  # Return True if pattern is found, False otherwise
```

In this corrected function, a specific pattern is defined to be matched against the `command.stderr`. If the pattern is found, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

This fix ensures that the function adheres to the expected behavior, and the test cases should pass as well.
