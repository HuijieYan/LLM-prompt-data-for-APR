Potential error location: The function is trying to access the 'stderr' attribute of the command input without passing the command as an argument.

Reason behind the bug: The function is not receiving the 'command' input as an argument, so it cannot access its 'stderr' attribute. Additionally, the _search function is not defined.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Pass the 'command' input as an argument to the function and define the _search function if it's required for the functionality.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command)

def _search(stderr):
    # Implementation of the search function
    pass
```
