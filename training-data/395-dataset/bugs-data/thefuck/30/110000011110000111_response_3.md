The error in the given code is that it is trying to access the `os` module without importing it. So, the `os` module is not accessible in the `match` function, which is causing the code to fail.

The reason behind this bug is that the `os` module is used without being imported. In Python, before using any module, it needs to be imported using the `import` statement.

To fix the bug, the `os` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file where the `match` function is defined.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```

By importing the `os` module at the beginning of the file, the `match` function will now have access to the `os.environ` attribute to check for the 'EDITOR' environment variable.

Once this change is made, the `match` function should work as expected and the test cases should pass without any AssertionError.
