Potential error location: The match function is not properly aligned within the file, and the indentation of the _search function is incorrect.

Reason for the bug: The match function is not properly defined or indented and the _search function is not properly indented under the file.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Properly align the match function and indent the _search function under it.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
