Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is that the 'os' module has not been imported, so the 'os.environ' and 'stderr' are not being recognized in the function.

Reason for the Bug:
The 'os' module needs to be imported in order to access the 'os.environ' and 'stderr' attributes.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Import the 'os' module at the beginning of the file to resolve the issue. Additionally, it seems that the '_search' function is missing or not defined, so it needs to be addressed as well. 

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

# Corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
Additionally, the '_search' function needs to be defined or imported from another module for the corrected code to work as intended.
