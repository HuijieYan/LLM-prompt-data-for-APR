Potential Error Location:
- The potential error location is the use of `_search` without any prior definition.

Reasons behind the Bug:
- The code is trying to check if 'EDITOR' is in the environment variables and then calls a function `_search` without implementing it anywhere.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if the `_search` function is defined elsewhere in the code. If not, consider removing the reference to it.
- If the intention is to search for a string in the command's stderr, consider using the appropriate string search method (e.g., `command.stderr.find('EDITOR')`).

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and command.stderr.find('EDITOR') != -1
```
