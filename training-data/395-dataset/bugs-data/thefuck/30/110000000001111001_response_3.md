The buggy function is trying to check if the 'EDITOR' environment variable is present in the os.environ dictionary and then calling a function `_search` with the `command.stderr` as an argument. However, the `_search` function is not defined in the provided code.

The code is also trying to access the `command.stderr` attribute, but the `command` object is of type `Command` and it does not have an attribute `stderr`.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to properly handle the `command` object and check for the existence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and command.script.startswith('ERROR')
```

In the corrected code, we are now simply checking if the 'EDITOR' environment variable is present and if the `command.script` starts with the word 'ERROR' (assuming this is a valid way to determine an error message). The exact condition to check for errors may vary depending on the actual use case.
