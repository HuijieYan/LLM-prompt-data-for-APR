The issue in the provided function is that the `_search` function is being called with `command.stderr` as a parameter but `_search` function does not seem to exist. The purpose of the `match` function is to return True if the 'EDITOR' environment variable is present and the `_search` function returns a match object, but the implementation is incorrect.

It seems like the `_search` function is supposed to search for a specific pattern in the `stderr` string and return a match object if found. The bug occurs because the correct logic for searching the pattern and returning the match object is not implemented.

To fix this bug, we can assume that the `_search` function is supposed to search for a specific pattern in the `stderr` string and return a match object if the pattern is found. We can use the `re.search` function for this purpose.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # assuming you want to search for the pattern 'error' in stderr
    pattern = r'error'
    return re.search(pattern, stderr)

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr) is not None
```
