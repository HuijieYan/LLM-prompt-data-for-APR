Potential error location: The function is checking if 'EDITOR' is in the os.environ and then calls a private method _search, but it's not clear what _search is supposed to do. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The function doesn't take the 'settings' parameter into account at all.
2. The usage of the private method _search is not clear and may not be defined anywhere.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the 'settings' parameter to determine how to match the command.
2. Remove the usage of the private method _search unless it's defined elsewhere.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and 'stderr' in command and command['stderr']  # Assuming command is a dictionary and we want to check if 'stderr' exists and has a value
```
If the _search method is necessary then it needs to be properly defined and utilized within the function.
