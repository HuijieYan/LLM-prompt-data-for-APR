Potential error: The indentation of the `match` function is incorrect, making it a nested function within the `_search` function.

Reason for bug: The `match` function should not be nested within the `_search` function. This incorrect nesting causes the function to be defined within another function, which is not the intended behavior.

Approach for fixing the bug: Correct the indentation of the `match` function to place it at the same level as the `_search` function.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
