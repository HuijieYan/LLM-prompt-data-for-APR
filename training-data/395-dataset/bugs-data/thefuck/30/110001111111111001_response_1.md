The problem occurs in the `match` function. The function checks if the 'EDITOR' key is in the `os.environ` and then attempts to call the `_search` function on the `command.stderr`. However, the `_search` function is not defined and creates an error.

The reason behind the bug is that the `match` function is trying to call an undefined function `_search`.

The bug can be fixed by defining the `_search` function and then modifying the `match` function to use it properly.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Define the _search function
def _search(stderr):
    # Add the search logic here
    pass

# Fix the match function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```

With the defined `_search` function, the `match` function will now be able to utilize it correctly.
