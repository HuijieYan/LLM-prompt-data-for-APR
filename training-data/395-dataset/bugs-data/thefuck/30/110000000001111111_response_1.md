The issue with the `match` function is that it is trying to check for the presence of a match in the `command.stderr` without importing the `os` and `re` modules, which are needed for the function to work correctly. Additionally, it is unclear what the `_search` function is as it is not defined within the provided code snippet.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r'pattern_to_match', command.stderr)
```

In this corrected code:
- We have imported the `os` and `re` modules to be able to access environment variables and perform regular expression searches, respectively.
- We use the `re.search()` function to look for a specific pattern in the `command.stderr` based on the provided test cases. You will need to replace `'pattern_to_match'` with the actual pattern you are looking for in the `command.stderr`.

Please note that the actual pattern to match in the `command.stderr` is missing in the provided test cases, so you need to replace `'pattern_to_match'` with the appropriate regular expression pattern based on the specific content of `command.stderr`.
