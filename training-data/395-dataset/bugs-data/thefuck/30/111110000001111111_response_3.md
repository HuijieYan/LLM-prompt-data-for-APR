The issue with the provided function is that it is missing the import statement for the `os` module. Additionally, it is missing the `_search` function, which seems to be a typo and should be replaced with `re.search` to use regular expression matching.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(command.stderr, settings)
```

This function now imports the `os` and `re` modules and uses the `re.search` function for pattern matching.
