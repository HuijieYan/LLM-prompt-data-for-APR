The buggy function `match` is attempting to match a regular expression using the `_search` function with the `command.stderr` as input. However, the indentation of the `match` function and the if condition is incorrect, which is causing it to always return `True` if the 'EDITOR' environment variable is present, and the `_search` function is called regardless of its result.

To fix the bug, the indentation of the `match` function should be corrected to include the if condition that checks for the presence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable. Additionally, the `_search` function should be passed the `command` object, and not its `stderr` attribute.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

import os

def _search(command):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def match(command, settings):
    if 'EDITOR' in os.environ:
        return _search(command)
    return False
```

With this correction, the `match` function now correctly checks for the presence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable and calls the `_search` function with the `command` object as input.

This correction ensures that the function returns `True` only if 'EDITOR' is present in the environment and the `_search` function returns a valid result. If 'EDITOR' is not present or the `_search` function does not return a valid result, the function will return `False`, as intended.
