The bug is occurring in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is trying to extract the upstream branch suggestion from the `stderr` of the `command` object.

The bug is occurring because in some cases, the `stderr` message contains multiple suggestions for setting the upstream branch, and the code is not handling this properly. It is assuming that the suggestion will always be located at `[-3]` index after splitting the `stderr` message by newline character.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle multiple suggestions by searching for the line that starts with "git push --set-upstream" and extracting the suggestion from that line.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip()
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script  # Return the original command.script if no suggestion is found
```

This corrected function will search for the line starting with "git push --set-upstream" in the `stderr` message and extract the suggestion. If no suggestion is found, it will return the original `command.script`.
