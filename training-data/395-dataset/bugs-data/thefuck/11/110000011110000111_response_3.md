The error message indicates that the assertion in the test case is failing because the expected output and the actual output are not matching. The expected output is "git push --set-upstream origin master" while the actual output is "git push --set-upstream origin master -u origin".

The potential error location within the function is the line that extracts the push_upstream information from the stderr. It seems that the partition method is not functioning as intended and is not correctly extracting the push_upstream value from the stderr.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the partition method used to extract the push_upstream value is not correctly partitioning the string and therefore not extracting the desired value effectively.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to use regular expressions to extract the push_upstream value from the stderr, or to identify a different string manipulation method that can accurately extract the desired value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream_match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (\S+)', command.stderr)
    if push_upstream_match:
        push_upstream = push_upstream_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # handle cases where push_upstream is not found in stderr
        return command.script  # return the original command if push_upstream is not found
```
