Potential error location: The potential error lies in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` as it tries to access the third last element of `stderr` after splitting it by a newline character.

Reason for the bug: The error occurs because the `stderr` might not always contain at least three elements after splitting by a newline character, causing an "index out of range" error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can add a check to ensure that the `stderr` contains at least three elements before trying to access the third last element.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) > 2:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # Handle the case where stderr doesn't contain at least three lines
        return command.script
```
