The error occurs in the function `get_new_command` where it is trying to extract the upstream branch from the stderr message of the `git push` command. The error seems to be related to the split operation on the stderr, which is leading to an incorrect extraction of the upstream branch.

The potential error location is within the `push_upstream` assignment line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is assuming a specific format for the stderr message, and when the format of the stderr message changes, the function fails to extract the correct upstream branch.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to search for the upstream branch using a regular expression in the stderr message. This will make the extraction more robust and independent of the exact format of the stderr message.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (.+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # If no match found, return the original script
        return command.script
```

This corrected code uses a regular expression to search for the `git push --set-upstream` pattern in the stderr message, and if found, it extracts the upstream branch. If no match is found, it simply returns the original script. This approach makes the function more flexible and robust to changes in the format of the stderr message.
