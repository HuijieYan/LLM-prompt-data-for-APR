The error in the provided function seems to be related to the way it processes the `stderr` attribute of the `Command` object. The function is supposed to extract information from `stderr` to determine the appropriate git command to execute, but it seems to be extracting the wrong information. This is causing the test case `test_get_new_command` to fail.

The function is incorrectly splitting the `stderr` attribute and extracting the third last line to get the `push_upstream` value. This approach appears to be sensitive to different error messages returned by the `git push` command, and it does not handle the presence of additional options like `-u` or `--quiet` correctly.

To fix this, we can modify the function to use a more robust approach to extract the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` attribute, ensuring it handles different error messages and variations of the `git push` command correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if "To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream" in command.stderr:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('git ')[-1].split('\n')[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

With this corrected function, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
