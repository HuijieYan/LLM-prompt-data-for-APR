The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to extract the upstream option from the error message in the `command.stderr` and replace it in `command.script` using the `replace_argument` function. However, it seems to have a bug in extracting the upstream option from `command.stderr`.

The bug occurs because the function is using the split method on `command.stderr` without considering the new line characters. This causes the extraction of the incorrect substring to assign to the `push_upstream` variable.

To fix this bug, we can use regular expressions to extract the upstream option from the error message in a more robust manner.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push (.*?)$', command.stderr, re.MULTILINE)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # return the original script if no match is found
```

In the corrected code, we use the `re.search` function to search for the pattern "git push" followed by any characters until the end of the line. This will correctly extract the upstream option from the error message.

By using regular expressions, we ensure that the extraction is more accurate and flexible, accommodating different variations of error messages.
