The error occurs due to the incorrect extraction of the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` within the `get_new_command` function. The buggy function splits the `command.stderr` string and tries to get the `push_upstream` value from the `-3` index, which is causing the incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to parse the `command.stderr` string more accurately. The `fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.` and the subsequent line provide the correct information. We need to extract the branch name from the `command.stderr` and use it to form the `push_upstream` value.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')

    if len(error_lines) >= 4:
        push_upstream = error_lines[-2].strip()
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This code correctly parses the `command.stderr` and extracts the necessary information to form the `push_upstream` value.
