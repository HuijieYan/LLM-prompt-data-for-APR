The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is not correctly parsing the `stderr` output to extract the upstream information. The function seems to always assume that the upstream information is available and only replaces the 'push' command with the extracted upstream information. This results in incorrect replacements.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to parse the `stderr` output to check if the "current branch has no upstream branch". If it does, then we should extract the suggested push command and replace the original 'push' command with it. Otherwise, we should simply return the original command as is.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if "has no upstream branch" in command.stderr:
        suggested_command = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().split()[-3:]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', ' '.join(suggested_command))
    else:
        return command.script
```

This revised function first checks if the "has no upstream branch" message exists in the stderr. If it does, it extracts the suggested command and replaces the original 'push' command with it. If not, it simply returns the original command. This approach should address the bug and ensure correct parsing and replacement of the commands.
