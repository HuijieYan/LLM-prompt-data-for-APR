The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to extract the suggested command from the error message and return it in a specific format. However, the current implementation uses the wrong logic to extract the command and does not handle cases where the upstream option is already included in the input command.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly assumes that the suggested command will always be the last three lines of the error message. This is not always the case, as demonstrated by the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly extract the suggested command from the error message, regardless of its position within the message. Additionally, we need to check if the upstream option is already included in the input command and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip()[4:]  # Extract the suggested command
            if '-u' in command.script_parts:  # Check if the upstream option is already included
                return replace_argument(command.script, '-u', push_upstream)  # Replace the upstream option
            else:
                return replace_command(command.script, push_upstream)  # Simply replace the command
    return command  # Return the original command if the suggestion is not found
```
