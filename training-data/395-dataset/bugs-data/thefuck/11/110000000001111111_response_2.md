The buggy function is trying to extract the suggested command from the error message and replace the 'push' command with the suggested one. However, the bug occurs because the function is not correctly identifying the upstream suggestion from the error message.

To fix the bug, the function should extract the suggested upstream command from the error message and replace the 'push' command with that extracted upstream command.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    error_message = command.stderr
    match = re.search(r'git push (.+)$', error_message, re.MULTILINE)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        new_script = re.sub(r'git push', f'git {push_upstream}', command.script)
        return new_script
    else:
        return command.script
```
