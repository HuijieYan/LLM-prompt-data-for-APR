The bug in the provided function is likely occurring because the function is attempting to access the last 3 lines of the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object and then extract the 'git' substring from it. However, the function does not handle cases where the required substring may not be present in the `stderr` attribute, leading to index out of range errors.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle different scenarios of `stderr` attribute content and extract the required substring accordingly. We can also incorporate error handling to avoid index out of range errors.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```
