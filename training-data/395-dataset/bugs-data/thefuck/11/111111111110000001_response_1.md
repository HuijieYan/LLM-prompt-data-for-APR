Potential error location: 
The potential error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`.
This line is trying to extract the upstream branch information from the `stderr` of the `git push` command.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `push_upstream` variable is being extracted using a hardcoded index from the split `stderr` string. This approach is error-prone because it assumes the exact position of the required information in the `stderr` string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of relying on a hardcoded index, use a more robust method to extract the upstream branch information from the `stderr` string.
2. Utilize regular expressions to extract the required information from the `stderr` string in a more reliable manner.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    regex_pattern = r'git push --set-upstream origin (\S+)'
    match = re.search(regex_pattern, command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command if upstream branch information is not found
```
