The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The error message indicates that the function is not producing the expected output.

The buggy function extracts the last error message part from the command's stderr, which suggests that the current branch has no upstream branch. It then creates a new command to push to the upstream branch. However, the buggy function incorrectly extracts the upstream branch information, resulting in an incorrect new command being generated.

To fix the bug, we should parse the error message from the stderr using regular expressions to extract the upstream branch information correctly. Then we can create the new command with the correct upstream branch information.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (\S+) (\S+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        upstream_branch = match.group(1)
        branch_name = match.group(2)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', f'push --set-upstream {upstream_branch} {branch_name}')
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected code uses regular expressions to match the required information from the error message in the stderr. Then it constructs the new command with the correct upstream branch information.
