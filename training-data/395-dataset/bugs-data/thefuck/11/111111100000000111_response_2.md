The bug is due to the incorrect handling of the stderr output in the `get_new_command` function. The function is attempting to split the stderr output and extract the upstream branch from it, but it's not accounting for different error messages or variations in the stderr output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to handle different error messages and extract the upstream branch in a more robust manner.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_11/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.split(' ')[-1]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.stderr
```
