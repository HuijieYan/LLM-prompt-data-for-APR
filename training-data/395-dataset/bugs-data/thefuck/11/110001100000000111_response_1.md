The error in the code seems to be related to the incorrect parsing of the command.stderr. The function is trying to split the stderr and extract the upstream branch from it, but it seems to be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic.

The potential error location is:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is assuming the location of the upstream branch in command.stderr, which may not always be at the same line index. 

To fix this bug, we can use a more robust approach to extract the upstream branch from the error message. We can consider using regular expressions to extract the relevant information from the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_11/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_message = command.stderr
    match = re.search(r'git push (--set-upstream|-u) (\S+)', error_message)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(2)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return None # handle case where upstream branch is not found in error message
```

This corrected code uses regular expressions to search for the pattern 'git push --set-upstream' or 'git push -u' followed by the upstream branch name, and then extracts the upstream branch from the error message. This approach is more robust and should handle different error message formats.
