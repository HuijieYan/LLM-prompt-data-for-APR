The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to split the `command.stderr` string and extract the upstream branch information from it. However, in some cases, the index used to get the upstream branch information is incorrect, leading to the wrong result.

It seems that the function is trying to extract the upstream branch suggestion from the `command.stderr` string, and then replace the argument 'push' with this suggestion in the `command.script` string. The bug occurs because the index used to extract the upstream branch suggestion is not being calculated correctly from the `command.stderr` string. This causes the wrong suggestion to be extracted and passed to the `replace_argument` function, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly calculate the index of the upstream branch suggestion in the `command.stderr` string and then extract the correct suggestion. We can use regex to extract the suggestion, which would make the code more robust and handle different scenarios more effectively.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    suggestion_match = re.search(r'git push (.+)$', command.stderr, re.MULTILINE)
    if suggestion_match:
        push_upstream = suggestion_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # If no suggestion is found, return the original command.script
```

In this corrected code, we use regular expression to search for the suggestion in the `command.stderr` string. If the suggestion is found, we extract it and replace the 'push' argument in the `command.script` string with the correct suggestion. If no suggestion is found, we return the original command.script. This approach should fix the bug and handle different cases more effectively.
