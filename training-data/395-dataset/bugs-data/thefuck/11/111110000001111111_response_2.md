The buggy function is trying to extract the suggested git command from the `stderr` of the `Command` object and replace the 'push' command with the suggested command. The buggy function is failing to extract the correct suggestion in some cases.

The reason for the bug is that the buggy function is relying on fixed indices to split and extract the suggested command from the `stderr`, which is not reliable as the position of the suggestion may vary.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to dynamically identify and extract the suggested command from the `stderr` of the `Command` object. We can use regular expressions to search for the suggested command pattern in the `stderr` and extract it.

Below is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    suggestion_match = re.search(r"git push (.+)$", command.stderr, re.MULTILINE)
    if suggestion_match:
        push_upstream = suggestion_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return original command if suggestion not found
```

This corrected code uses regular expression to search for the pattern "git push" followed by any characters to the end of the line in the `command.stderr`, which represents the suggested command. If a match is found, it replaces the 'push' command in the original command with the suggested command. If no match is found, it returns the original command unchanged.

This approach will make the function more robust and reliable in extracting the suggested command from the `stderr` in various scenarios.
