Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is trying to extract the upstream branch name from the stderr of the git push command.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes that the stderr of the git push command will always have the upstream branch name at the same position (-3) in the split list. This assumption may not always hold true and can lead to an IndexError if the stderr does not contain the expected format.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the stderr contains the expected format before trying to extract the upstream branch name.
2. Use regular expressions to extract the upstream branch name from the stderr in a more reliable way.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'Everything up-to-date\n\n\[new branch\] (\S+) -> (.+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        upstream_branch = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', upstream_branch)
    else:
        return command.script
```
