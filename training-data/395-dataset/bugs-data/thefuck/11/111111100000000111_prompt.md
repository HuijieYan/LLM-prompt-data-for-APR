Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_11/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)

```




# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
```
