The bug in the function is that it splits the `command.stderr` incorrectly to get the upstream branch information. This causes the incorrect assignment of the `push_upstream` variable.

The function is trying to extract the upstream branch information from the `command.stderr` by splitting it and then assigning the third to last element after stripping the whitespace to the `push_upstream`. This can lead to errors as the position of the required value may change in the future.

To fix this, we need to update the function to use a more reliable method to extract the upstream branch information.

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = None
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith("    git push --set-upstream"):
            push_upstream = line.strip().replace("    ", "")
            break

    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
```
