The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. It seems that the function is trying to split the `stderr` message by newline and then access the third-last element, assuming it contains the information required to form the new command. However, this assumption is not reliable, as the error message structure may change, leading to an incorrect extraction of the required information.

The reason for the bug is that the function is relying on an assumption about the structure of the `stderr` message, which is not guaranteed to remain consistent across different scenarios. Additionally, the function is not handling cases where the required information is not present in the `stderr` message.

To fix the bug, the function should instead parse the `stderr` message to extract the necessary information in a more reliable way. It should also handle the case when the required information is not present and provide a fallback behavior. 

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().split()[-2]  # Extract the upstream branch from the error message
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', '--set-upstream ' + push_upstream)
    # Fallback - if the required information is not found in stderr, return a default command
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', '--set-upstream origin master')
```

With this corrected function, it properly parses the `stderr` message to extract the required information and provides a fallback behavior in case the required information is not present. This should resolve the issue and make the function more robust.
