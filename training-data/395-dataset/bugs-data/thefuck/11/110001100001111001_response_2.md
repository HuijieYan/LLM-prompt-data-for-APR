The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect parsing of the `command.stderr` string to extract the `push_upstream` value. The function tries to split the `command.stderr` string by the newline character and then accesses the third last element, splits it by 'git ', and takes the third partition. This process is error-prone and does not handle variations in the stderr message adequately.

To fix this, it is better to use regular expressions to extract the `push_upstream` value, as it will be more robust to changes in the error message format.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_11/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_message = command.stderr
    match = re.search(r'git push (.+)', error_message)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command
```

In the corrected code, the `re.search` method is used to find a match for the pattern `'git push (.+)'` in the `error_message`. If a match is found, the `push_upstream` value is extracted using `match.group(1)` and then used to replace the original push command in the script.

This approach is more robust and should handle variations in the error message format.
