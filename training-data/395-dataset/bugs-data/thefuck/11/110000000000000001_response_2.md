The potential error location in the given function is in the line:
`push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that if the `command.stderr` does not contain the expected information or if the string does not match the expected format, this will result in an index out of range error or a NoneType object error.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the `stderr` contains the expected information before attempting to split and access the required data.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'git ' in command.stderr:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # Handle the case where 'git ' is not found in command.stderr
        return command.script
```

In the corrected function, we check if the 'git ' string is present in the `command.stderr`. If it is present, then we proceed to split and access the required data. If not, we simply return the original `command.script`. This fix ensures that the code does not throw errors if the expected information is not present in `command.stderr`.
