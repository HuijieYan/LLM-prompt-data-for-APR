The error is occurring because the `get_new_command` function is incorrectly extracting the push upstream branch from the stderr. It is currently relying on splitting the stderr string and extracting the upstream branch, which is causing issues when the command is run with additional parameters like `-u` or `--set-upstream`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to correctly extract the upstream branch from the stderr, regardless of the parameters passed with the `git push` command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.split('git push --set-upstream ')[1]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script  # Return the original command if the upstream branch is not found
```

This corrected function iterates through the lines of the stderr to find the line that contains the information about setting the upstream branch. Once found, it correctly extracts the upstream branch without relying on a fixed index or the presence of other parameters.

This should resolve the issue and make the function work correctly for all test cases.
