The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line attempts to extract the upstream branch information from the stderr of the command.

The bug occurs because the line is trying to split the stderr string at '\n' and then access the third last element, which may not always contain the required information. This leads to inconsistencies in extracting the upstream branch information.

To fix the bug, we can use regular expressions to extract the upstream branch information from the stderr of the command. This will make the extraction more reliable and consistent.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push (--\S+ )*(\S+ \S+)$', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(2)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # If match is not found, return the original command script
```

In this corrected code, we used the `re.search` function to identify the required information from the stderr of the command. The regular expression `r'git push (--\S+ )*(\S+ \S+)$'` looks for patterns matching the message about setting the upstream branch in the stderr. If a match is found, the upstream branch information is extracted and used to replace the argument in the command script. If no match is found, the original command script is returned.
