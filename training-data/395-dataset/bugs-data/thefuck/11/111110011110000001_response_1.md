Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is splitting the `stderr` and extracting the relevant information from it, which seems to be causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the split and extraction logic used in the `get_new_command` function is not properly handling the different variations of the `git push` command and its associated error message. As a result, the incorrect downstream command is being generated.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use regular expressions to extract the desired information from the `stderr` of the `git push` command.
2. Ensure that the logic can handle different variations of the `git push` command and its associated error message.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream origin [\w-]+', command.stderr)
    if match:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', match.group(0))
    else:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --set-upstream origin master')
```
