The error is occurring in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` of the given function `get_new_command`. The purpose of this code is to extract the upstream push command from the error message.

The error occurs when the location of the upstream push command in the error message changes. The current implementation assumes that the relevant line will always be the third from the last in the `stderr`, which is not always the case. This assumption causes the incorrect extraction of the upstream push command.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to find the line containing the upstream push command dynamically based on the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    push_upstream = None
    for line in error_lines:
        if "git push --set-upstream" in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip()
            break
    
    if push_upstream:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command
```

In the corrected code, we split the `stderr` into individual lines and then iterate over each line to find the one containing the upstream push command. If found, we use it to replace the old push command in the `command.script`. If not found, we return the original `command`.
