The error message from the test function is showing an AssertionError, indicating that the output of the get_new_command function does not match the expected output for the input 'git push -u origin'. The expected output is "git push --set-upstream origin master", but the actual output is "git push --set-upstream origin master -u origin".

The potential error location within the get_new_command function is the line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The bug is caused by the incorrect parsing of the stderr output. The function is extracting the -u option from the stderr and adding it to the new command, which is not required.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to correctly parse the desired output from the stderr and use that in constructing the new command. This can be done by extracting the desired suggestion from the stderr and then constructing the new command with the correct options.

Here's the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    suggestion = None
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            suggestion = line.strip()
            break
    if suggestion:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', suggestion)
    else:
        return None  # handle case where suggestion is not found
```

This corrected code iterates through the lines of the stderr and looks for the line starting with '    git push --set-upstream', which contains the correct suggestion. If it finds the suggestion, it constructs the new command using that suggestion and returns it. If no suggestion is found, it returns None to handle that case.
