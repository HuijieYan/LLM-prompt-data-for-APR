The bug occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The bug seems to be related to a wrong index being used to access the `stderr` message.

The issue is related to the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is extracting the relevant line from the `stderr` output, but it's assuming that the relevant line will always be in the third-to-last position after splitting by '\n'.

The buggy code seems to be assuming a consistent position for the relevant information in the `stderr`. However, the information might not always be in the same position, leading to incorrect parsing and generation of the new command.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to search for the relevant line from the `stderr` based on a pattern rather than its position.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip()
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream.partition('git ')[2])
    return command.script  # return the original command if the relevant line is not found
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the lines of the `stderr` output and look for the line containing the relevant information. Once we find it, we extract the necessary part and use it to generate the new command. If the relevant line is not found, we return the original command. This approach makes the function more robust and less reliant on the position of the information in the `stderr` output.
