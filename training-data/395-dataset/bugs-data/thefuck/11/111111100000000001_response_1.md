Potential Error: The error likely occurs at the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line attempts to split the `stderr` output of the `command` and extract the upstream branch by splitting at 'git' and accessing the third element. 

Reason for the bug: The error likely occurs because the `stderr` output may not be as expected, and the indexing may not be accurate due to different error message formats.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can modify the function to extract the upstream branch from the `stderr` output in a more robust way, such as using regular expressions to extract the branch name.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')  # Split the stderr output into lines

    # Iterate through each line to find the line containing the upstream branch information
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if 'Your branch is up to date with' in line:
            match = re.search(r'(?<=up to date with ).*$', line)
            if match:
                upstream_branch = match.group(0)
                return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', upstream_branch)

    return command  # If upstream branch information is not found, return the original command
```

In the corrected code, we use regular expressions to search for the upstream branch information in the `stderr` output. This approach is more flexible and can handle different error message formats.
