The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is not handling the case where the `stderr` does not contain the expected information. The bug is in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. If the `stderr` does not contain the expected "To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream" message, then this line will cause an `IndexError` because `split('\n')[-3]` will not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the expected message exists in the `stderr`. If it does, we can then extract the push upstream information. Otherwise, we can return the original command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3 and "To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream" in stderr_lines[-3]:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This code first checks if the `stderr` contains the expected message. If it does, then it extracts the push upstream information as before. If not, it simply returns the original command.
