The error location within the function is likely in the line where push_upstream is being assigned. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to split the stderr output and then extract the suggested git command from it. However, it seems that the split and extraction logic is not correctly accounting for the changed output format after the #538 issue was merged.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly extract the suggested git command from the stderr output. It seems that we should split the stderr by the ':' character and take the last component of the split. Then, we should split that component by the 'use' string and take the first component of this split. This should give us the correct suggested git command.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    suggested_command = command.stderr.split(':')[-1].split('use')[0].strip()
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', suggested_command)
```
