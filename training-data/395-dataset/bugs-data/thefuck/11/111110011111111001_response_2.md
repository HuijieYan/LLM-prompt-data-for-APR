The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is incorrectly splitting the `command.stderr` string and obtaining the wrong portion as the upstream branch to push.

The bug in the function is due to the incorrect calculation of the `upstream_option_index`. This index is used to extract the necessary part of the `command.stderr` to get the upstream branch to push. However, the logic used to calculate this index is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the index of the `git push` command in the `command.script_parts` list, and then use that index to parse the `command.stderr` string to extract the upstream branch name.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    push_index = command.script_parts.index('git') + 1  # Find the index of 'git push' in command.script_parts
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git push ')[2]  # Extract the upstream argument
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', f'push {push_upstream}')  # Replace the push part of the command with the corrected upstream argument
```
