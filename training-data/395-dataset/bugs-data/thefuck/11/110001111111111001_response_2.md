The buggy function `get_new_command` extracts the last line of the `command.stderr`, which provides the upstream branch information. It then appends this information to the `git push` command.

The issue arises from the usage of `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` to extract the upstream branch information. This approach assumes that the error message will always be at a specific index in the split list, causing the function to fail when the stderr message format differs.

To fix this issue, we can parse the stderr message to check for the line containing the upstream branch information, instead of relying on a specific index in the split list.

The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script
```

By iterating through the lines in `command.stderr` and searching for the line containing the upstream branch information, the correct information can be extracted in a more reliable manner.
