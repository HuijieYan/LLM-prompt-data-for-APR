The error is occurring because the `get_new_command` function is not correctly extracting the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` input. The `push_upstream` value is supposed to be extracted from the error message, but the current code is using the `split('\n')[-3]` method, which is not robust and can lead to incorrect extraction.

The potential error location in the code is the line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is assuming the location of the `git push` command within the `stderr` message, which may not always be at the same position. This can lead to inaccuracies in extracting the `push_upstream` value.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly extract the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` input. It can be done using regular expressions to match the `git push --set-upstream origin master` pattern within the `stderr` message.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream origin \w+', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(0)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

By using regular expressions to precisely match the `git push --set-upstream origin master` pattern within the `stderr` message, the corrected function can accurately extract the `push_upstream` value and replace it in the command.
