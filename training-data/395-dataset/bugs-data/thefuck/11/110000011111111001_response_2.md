The problem seems to be related to how the `get_new_command` function is handling the `stderr` output of the `git push` command. It attempts to extract the necessary information from the `stderr` output using string manipulation, but it is not handling different scenarios correctly.

The buggy function is trying to split the `stderr` output and extract the upstream branch information. However, it does not account for the possibility that the command might have additional flags like `-u` or `--quiet`. This leads to incorrect extraction of the upstream branch information.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle different scenarios based on the content of the `stderr`. If the `stderr` contains information about setting the upstream branch, we can extract that information and return the updated command. If not, we can simply return the original command.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('To push the current branch'):
            parts = line.split('git push ')
            if len(parts) > 1:
                push_upstream = parts[1].strip()
                return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
            else:
                return command.script

    return command.script
```

This corrected function checks the `stderr` for the specific message indicating the need to set the upstream branch. If the message is found, it extracts the necessary information and returns the updated command. Otherwise, it simply returns the original command.
