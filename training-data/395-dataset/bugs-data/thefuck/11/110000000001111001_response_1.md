The buggy function is trying to extract the 'push --set-upstream origin master' string from the error message returned in the stderr attribute of the 'command' object. However, it incorrectly assumes that this string is always located in the second-to-last line of the error message.

The bug occurs because the function always tries to extract the information from a fixed position without checking the actual content of the error message. This approach is not reliable because the error message may vary, and the required information may not always be in the same position.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the error message contains the specific pattern 'git push --set-upstream origin' and then extract the relevant information accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if 'git push --set-upstream origin' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script  # Return the original command script if the pattern is not found
```
