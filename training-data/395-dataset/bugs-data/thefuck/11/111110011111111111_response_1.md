The error message from the test function indicates that the buggy function is not producing the expected output for the second test case. It seems that the function is not handling the `-u` flag correctly.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the manipulation of the `push_upstream` variable, which is used to construct the new command.

The reason behind the bug is that the current implementation of the function does not distinguish between the presence of the `-u` flag in the original `git push` command and the subsequent construction of the new command.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the `-u` flag is present in the original `git push` command. If it is, the function should construct the new command without the `-u` flag and with the `--set-upstream` option.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if 'fatal: The current branch' in stderr_lines[0]:
        upstream_option = stderr_lines[-3].split('git ')[-1]
        if '-u' in command.script_parts:
            new_script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part != '-u']
        else:
            new_script_parts = command.script_parts
        new_script = ' '.join(new_script_parts)
        return replace_argument(new_script + ' ' + upstream_option, 'push', 'push --set-upstream')
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected code first checks if the error message indicates the absence of an upstream branch. If so, it extracts the upstream option from the error message. Then, it checks if the original script_parts contain the `-u` flag. If it does, the flag is removed, and the new command is constructed without the `-u` flag. Finally, the upstream option is appended to the new command with the `--set-upstream` option.
