The error occurs because the original function incorrectly extracts the upstream suggestion from the `stderr` string. It seems to be assuming a specific location for the relevant information in the error message, which is not valid for all cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to extract the upstream suggestion in a more robust way that is not dependent on its location within the `stderr` string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    matches = re.search(r'git push (.*)$', command.stderr, re.MULTILINE)
    if matches:
        push_upstream = matches.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

With this correction, the function will use a regular expression to extract the `git push` command suggestion from the `stderr` string, ensuring that it works for all cases.
