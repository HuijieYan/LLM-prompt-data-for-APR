Potential Error Location: 

The potential error is in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is trying to extract the git push upstream information from the command's stderr, but it may raise an IndexError if the split result does not have enough elements, and it may fail if the 'git' keyword is not found.

Reasons behind the Bug: 

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that the stderr from the command will always have the structure it expects. If the stderr does not match the expected structure, it will cause an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Use error handling to catch potential exceptions.
2. Check for the presence of the 'git' keyword in the stderr before trying to extract the information.
3. Ensure that the stderr from the command is in the expected format before processing it.
4. Provide a default value or error message if the expected information is not found in the stderr.

Corrected Code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) > 2:
        for line in stderr_lines:
            if 'git' in line:
                push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
                return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    # default behavior if git info is not found
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'origin')

```
