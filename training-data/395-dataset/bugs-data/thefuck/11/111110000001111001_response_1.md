The buggy function is designed to extract the last line of the `command.stderr` and then manipulate it to form a new command. However, the buggy function is not correctly extracting the desired substring from the `command.stderr` for all cases.

The buggy part of the code is the line that extracts the `push_upstream` value:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```
This line does not handle different scenarios properly, resulting in incorrect extraction of the desired substring.

Approaches to fix the bug:
1. Split the `command.stderr` by newline and directly extract the last relevant line.
2. Use a regular expression to extract the desired substring from the `command.stderr`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re  # For using regular expression

def get_new_command(command):
    last_line = command.stderr.split('\n')[-2]  # Extract the last relevant line

    # Use regular expression to extract the desired substring
    match = re.search(r'git\s(.+)$', last_line)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command script if pattern not found
```
