The potential error in the function is the use of the `@git_support` decorator, which is not a valid Python decorator. It seems like the intention was to have a decorator that supports Git commands, but it's not a standard decorator in Python.

The function is trying to extract the Git push upstream from the stderr of the command and then replace the 'push' command with the upstream value in the command script.

To fix this, we can remove the `@git_support` decorator and handle the Git specific operations within the function itself. We also need to handle cases where the stderr might not contain the expected information.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return "Error: Git push upstream not found"
```

In this corrected code, we first split the stderr into lines and then check if there are at least 3 lines. If so, we extract the push upstream and replace the command script. If not, we return an error message. There's no need for the `@git_support` decorator as it was not a standard Python decorator.
