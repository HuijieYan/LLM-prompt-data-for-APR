The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it is trying to split the command's `stderr` by '\n' and then accessing the third last element. This approach is error-prone as the `stderr` message might change, and the required output might not always reside in the third last position. The buggy function is not handling different cases effectively, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to use a more robust and generalizable approach to extract the required `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` message. We can use regular expressions to search for the pattern 'git push' followed by '--set-upstream origin' and extract the subsequent part as the `push_upstream`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push\s+--set-upstream origin\s+(\S+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # No modification if pattern not found
```

This corrected code uses regular expression to search for the required pattern in the `stderr` message and extract the `push_upstream` value. If the pattern is found, it replaces the 'push' argument in the command script with the extracted `push_upstream` value. If the pattern is not found, it returns the original command script without any modification.

This approach ensures that the function can handle different cases of `stderr` messages and reliably extract the `push_upstream` value, thus fixing the bug.
