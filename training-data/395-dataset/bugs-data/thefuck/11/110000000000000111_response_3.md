The error seems to be related to the incorrect suggestion being made by the function when 'git push' fails.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is incorrectly parsing the error message from the 'git push' command and extracting the push_upstream value from it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the error message and extract the push_upstream value.

Here's the corrected code for the function:
```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.strip().split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.split()[-2]  # Extracting the push_upstream value
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command
```
In this corrected code, we are splitting the error message into lines and then iterating over each line to find the line containing 'git push --set-upstream'. Once found, we extract the push_upstream value from that line and use it to replace the argument in the command script. If the line is not found, we return the original command.
