1. The test case is checking the output of the `get_new_command` function with different input Command objects and their corresponding stderr messages. The error message indicates that the output of the function does not match the expected output for the input Command('git push -u origin', stderr=stderr).

2. The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is likely in the line:
   ```python
   push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
   ```
   This line is extracting the upstream branch name from the stderr of the `git push` command.

3. The bug is occurring because the `split('\n')[-3]` is trying to access the third to last element of the split stderr, which may not exist if the stderr does not contain enough lines. This is leading to an index out of range error.

4. To fix the bug, we can first check if there are enough lines in the stderr before trying to access the third to last line. If there are not enough lines, we can return an appropriate error message or handle it in a different way.

5. Corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # Handle the case where stderr does not contain enough lines
        return "Error: Unable to get upstream branch from stderr"
```
