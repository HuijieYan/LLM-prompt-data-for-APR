The potential error in the function is with the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line tries to split the `command.stderr` string and extract the second partition after 'git' to get the push upstream command. However, this approach is not reliable, as it depends on the specific format and positioning of the error message, which may change.

To fix this bug, we should use a more robust method to extract the push upstream command from the error message. We can use regular expressions to search for the pattern that matches the push upstream command, which is `'git push --set-upstream origin <branch>'`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream_match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream origin \w+', command.stderr)
    if push_upstream_match:
        push_upstream = push_upstream_match.group(0)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected function uses the `re.search` function to find the push upstream command pattern in the error message. If a match is found, it replaces the 'push' command with the push upstream command using the `replace_argument` function. Otherwise, it returns the original command script. This approach is more reliable and resistant to changes in the error message format.
