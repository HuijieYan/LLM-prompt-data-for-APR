The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is not correctly extracting the upstream branch from the stderr string. It tries to split the stderr string and access the third last element without considering that the number of elements in the split string may vary. 

To fix the bug, we should extract the upstream branch from the stderr by using a regular expression to match the specific pattern rather than relying on the position of the string in the split result.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    pattern = r"git push --set-upstream origin (.+)"
    match = re.search(pattern, command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return original command if pattern not found
```

By using the regular expression pattern to extract the upstream branch from the stderr, the function will be more robust and able to handle different variations of the error message.
