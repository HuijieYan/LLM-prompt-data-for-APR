The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to extract the suggested `git push --set-upstream` command from the error message and replace the `push` command in the original `command.script` with the extracted suggestion.

The bug occurs because the `push_upstream` is derived by simply splitting the `command.stderr` string and taking the third from last item without considering the variations in the output of the `git` command. The buggy function does not account for the presence of the `-u` option in the `command.script`.

To fix the bug, we need to parse the `command.stderr` to check if the current `command.script` contains the `-u` option or not. Then, extract the suggestion accordingly and replace the `push` command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    suggestion_line = stderr_lines[-3].strip()
    
    if '-u' in command.script:
        push_upstream = suggestion_line.partition('use\n    ')[2]
    else:
        push_upstream = suggestion_line.partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle the different variations of the `git` command's output and extract the suggestion accordingly. This should fix the issue and provide the expected behavior for the function.
