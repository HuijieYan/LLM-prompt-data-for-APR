Potential error location: 

The error likely occurs in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. The function is trying to extract the upstream branch from the error message, but it's not handling the case where the error message format has changed, as indicated by the GitHub issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurred because the function is relying on a specific format of the error message, and when the format changed, it caused the function to extract incorrect information.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Instead of relying on the specific format of the error message, the function could use a more robust method to extract the upstream branch from the error message.
2. It could also handle different error message formats more gracefully, for example, by checking for different patterns before extracting the upstream branch.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')  # Split error message into lines
    for line in reversed(error_lines):
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in line:  # Find line containing the suggestion
            push_upstream = line.split('git push --set-upstream ')[1].split()[0]  # Extract the upstream branch
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return ''  # If suggestion is not found, return an empty string or handle it in a different way
```
