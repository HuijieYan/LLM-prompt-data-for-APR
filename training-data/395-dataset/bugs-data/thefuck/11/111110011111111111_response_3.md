The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function when it tries to process the upstream option from the `command.stderr`. The function appears to be splitting the `command.stderr` string and extracting the upstream option incorrectly.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that the `stderr` will contain the upstream option in the same fixed position for every input. However, in reality, the upstream option may appear at different positions in the `stderr`, causing the function to extract the wrong value.

To fix the bug, the function should use a more robust method to extract the upstream option from the `stderr`. One way to achieve this is by using regular expressions to search for the upstream option in the `stderr` string. This would ensure that the function can correctly extract the upstream option regardless of its position within the `stderr`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push (.+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1).strip()
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this code, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now correctly extract the upstream option from the `command.stderr` for all input cases.
