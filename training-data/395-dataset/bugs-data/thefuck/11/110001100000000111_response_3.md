Potential error location: 

The error is likely occurring at the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is attempting to split the `stderr` output of the command and extract the necessary information. However, the splitting and extraction may not be robust enough to handle all possible error messages.

Reasons behind the bug:

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not accurately parsing the error message to retrieve the necessary information. The error message structure might vary, and the function does not handle this variability properly, leading to incorrect parsing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use regular expressions to parse the error message and extract the necessary information.
2. Implement more robust error message parsing logic to handle different error message formats.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_message = command.stderr
    matched = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream [\w-]+ [^: ]+', error_message)
    if matched:
      push_upstream = matched.group()
      return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
      return ""
```

In the corrected code, we use regular expression to search for the pattern 'git push --set-upstream' followed by a remote and a branch name. If a match is found, we use that as the `push_upstream` value and return the new command. Otherwise, we return an empty string. This approach provides a more robust way of extracting the information we need from the error message.
