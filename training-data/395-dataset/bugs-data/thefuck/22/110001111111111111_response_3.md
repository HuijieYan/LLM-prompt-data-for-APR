The error message states that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" on line 85 in the types.py file. This error occurs when trying to access the first element of an empty list, which is happening in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]]`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]]`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_cached` list is empty, and the code is trying to access its first element, which doesn't exist. This is leading to an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `_cached` list is empty before accessing its first element. If it's empty, we should handle it differently. One way to fix this is to use an if statement to check if `_cached` is not empty before accessing its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if _cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
