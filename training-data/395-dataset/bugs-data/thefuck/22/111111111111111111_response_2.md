The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" on line 85 of the `thefuck/types.py` file, within the `_realise` method. The problematic line is `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)`.

The bug occurs because `self._cached` is an empty list `[]`, and the code is trying to access the first element of an empty list, which results in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, you should first check if `self._cached` is not empty before accessing its first element.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self._cached` is not empty. If it's not empty, we append its first element to the sorted `commands`. If it's empty, we simply assign the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`. This will ensure that the IndexError is avoided.
