Error:
The buggy function `_realise` is trying to access the `self._commands` attribute, which is a `list_iterator` type. However, the `_remove_duplicates` function expects a `list` as an input, which is causing the issue.

Potential error location:
The issue lies in the call to `_remove_duplicates` within the `_realise` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_remove_duplicates` function is designed to work with a list as an input, but it is receiving a `list_iterator` type, which causes a type error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to convert the `list_iterator` type to a `list` before passing it to the `_remove_duplicates` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(self._commands)  # Convert list_iterator to list
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(commands)  # Pass the list to _remove_duplicates
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
