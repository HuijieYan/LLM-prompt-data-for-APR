Potential error location: 
The error may occur when trying to access the first element of the self._cached list, as self._cached is an empty list at the beginning of the function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function is trying to access the first element of self._cached list without checking if it is empty. This will result in an IndexError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to add a check to see if self._cached is empty before trying to access its first element. If it is empty, we can simply set it to the sorted commands list.

Corrected code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if not self._cached:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
