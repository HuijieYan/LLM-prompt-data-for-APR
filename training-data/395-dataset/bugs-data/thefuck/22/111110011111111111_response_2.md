The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred at line 85 in the `_realise` function. This error is happening at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`, indicating that the attempt to access index 0 of `self._cached` led to the error.

The reason behind this bug is that `self._cached` is an empty list (`[]`) at this point, and accessing index 0 of an empty list raises an IndexError.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle the case where `self._cached` is empty before attempting to access index 0.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if self._cached:  # Check if _cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, the `if self._cached:` statement is used to check if `_cached` is not empty before attempting to access index 0. If `_cached` is empty, then the `sorted` function is used directly on `commands` and assigned to `_cached`. If `_cached` is not empty, then it is appended with the first element and the sorted commands.

This should fix the bug and prevent the IndexError from occurring.
