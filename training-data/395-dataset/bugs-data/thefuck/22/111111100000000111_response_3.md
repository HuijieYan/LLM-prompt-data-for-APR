Potential error:
The `_remove_duplicates` method is being called with `self._commands` as an argument but the method itself doesn't take `self` as an argument. 

Reasons behind the bug:
The `_remove_duplicates` method should be an instance method, which needs to take `self` as an argument. It seems like the method was intended to be an instance method, but the `self` argument was missing.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Add the `self` parameter to the `_remove_duplicates` method so that it becomes an instance method and can access the instance variables.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """

    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
