The potential error in the provided function is that it tries to access the first element of the `self._cached` list without checking if it is empty. This can lead to an `IndexError` if `self._cached` is empty.

To fix this, we can check if `self._cached` is empty before trying to access its first element. If it is empty, we can directly assign the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self._cached` is not empty. If it is not empty, we use the existing logic to concatenate the first element of `self._cached` with the sorted `commands`. If `self._cached` is empty, we directly assign the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`. This ensures that we don't encounter an `IndexError` when `self._cached` is empty.
