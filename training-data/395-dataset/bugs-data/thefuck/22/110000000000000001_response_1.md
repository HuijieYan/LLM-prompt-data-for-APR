Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)` where it seems that self._cached is being used before it has been initialized.

Reasons behind the bug:
The code tries to access `self._cached[0]` before it has been assigned any value, which will result in an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to initialize `self._cached` with an empty list before using it in the `sorted` function.

Corrected code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = []
    if commands:
        self._cached.append(sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)[0])
        self._cached.extend(sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)[1:])
    else:
        self._cached = []
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
