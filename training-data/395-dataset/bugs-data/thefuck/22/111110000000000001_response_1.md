The potential error in the _realise function is that it is trying to access self._commands which is not defined anywhere in the code provided. It seems like there might be a missing attribute in the class or the code segment where self._commands should have been initialized is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that self._commands is properly initialized before it is used in the _realise function.

Here's the corrected code for the _realise function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    if not hasattr(self, '_commands'):
        raise AttributeError("'_commands' attribute is not defined.")

    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
