Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)` where the `_cached` attribute is being manipulated.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. It looks like the intention is to add the first element of `self._cached` to the sorted list of `commands` in order to remove duplicates and sort the commands. However, the implementation is incorrect.
2. The sorted function doesn't work as intended with the addition of the first element of `_cached` and it may lead to an incorrect sorting.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Generate a new list that contains the first element of `self._cached` and the sorted list of `commands` separately.
2. Remove duplicates and sort the commands correctly.

Corrected code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    sorted_commands = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted_commands
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
