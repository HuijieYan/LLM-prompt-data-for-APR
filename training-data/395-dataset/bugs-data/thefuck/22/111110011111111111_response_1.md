The error message indicated that there was an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 85, which is caused by the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)` in the `_realise` function.

The bug occurred because `self._cached` is initially an empty list `[]`, and in the `_realise` function, it tries to access the first element (`self._cached[0]`) of the empty list which caused the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we should check if `self._cached` is empty before trying to access its first element and modify the line to handle this case. We can initialize `self._cached` with an empty list to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
  
    if not self._cached:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)

    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
