Potential Error Location: The error is occurring at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)` inside the `_realise` method.

Reason for the Bug: The issue is that `self._cached` is being accessed as if it is expected to have at least one element, but it is not being initialized correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to ensure that `self._cached` is correctly initialized before trying to access its elements.

Corrected Code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected _realise function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    # Ensure self._cached is initialized as an empty list
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached'):
        self._cached = []

    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
