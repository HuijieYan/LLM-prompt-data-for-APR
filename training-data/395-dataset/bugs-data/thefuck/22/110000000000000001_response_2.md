Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is in the line where we are trying to sort the commands using the lambda function for the key. It seems like the lambda function is referencing a "priority" attribute of the corrected_command, but no "priority" attribute seems to be defined for the corrected_command object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the lambda function is trying to access a "priority" attribute of the corrected_command, which does not exist. This is causing a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by using an attribute of the corrected_command object that can be used for sorting, such as "_priority" or any other relevant attribute. Additionally, we should also check if the "priority" attribute is indeed the correct attribute to use for sorting.

Corrected code:
```python
# Corrected function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command._priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
