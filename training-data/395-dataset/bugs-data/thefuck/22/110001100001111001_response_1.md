The potential error in the code is that the `_remove_duplicates` method is being called using `self._commands`, which is a list_iterator object, as the argument. This is not the correct way to call the method with the correct argument.

The `_remove_duplicates` method expects a list of commands as input, but it is being called with a list_iterator object, which is incorrect. This is likely the cause of the error.

To fix this bug, the `self._commands` list_iterator object should be converted to a list before passing it to the `_remove_duplicates` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(self._commands)  # convert list_iterator to list
    corrected_commands = self._remove_duplicates(commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        corrected_commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In this corrected code, the `self._commands` list_iterator object is converted to a list using the `list()` function before passing it to the `_remove_duplicates` method. This should fix the bug and allow the method to work correctly.
