The buggy function `_realise` is trying to use the function `_remove_duplicates` as a method of the same class, but it is not defined as a method. This causes a `self` reference error and prevents the function from working correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to define `_remove_duplicates` as a method within the class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    def _remove_duplicates(corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    commands = _remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
