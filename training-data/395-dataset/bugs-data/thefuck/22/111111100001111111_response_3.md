The potential error in the given code is in the _realise() function. The code seems to be trying to access the _commands attribute of the object, but it is a list_iterator object, which cannot be directly accessed like a list.

The bug occurs because the _commands attribute is a list_iterator object, not an actual list. This causes an error when trying to access elements from it.

To fix this bug, we need to convert the list_iterator object into a list before performing any list operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the _realise() function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(self._commands)  # Convert list_iterator to list
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
