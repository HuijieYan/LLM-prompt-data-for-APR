The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. This suggests that the `_cached` list does not have an item at index 0, hence the error.

The potential error location within the `_realise` function is at `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. 

The error occurs because the `_cached` list doesn't have an item at index 0. This is likely because it hasn't been initialized with any values.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `_cached` with an empty list at the beginning of the class and then modify the `_realise` function to append the sorted `commands` directly to `_cached`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
# corrected _realise function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

With this correction, the `_realise` function will correctly sort the `commands` and store them in the `_cached` list. This should resolve the "IndexError: list index out of range" issue.
