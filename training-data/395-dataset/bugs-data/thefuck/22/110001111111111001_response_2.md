Based on the error message and the test case, the issue seems to be related to an "IndexError" that occurs at line 85 in the function `_realise()` in the file "types.py". The error indicates that a list index is out of range, which means that `self._cached` is an empty list, and the code is trying to access its first element `[0]` which doesn't exist.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to access the first element of `self._cached` list ([0]) without checking if the list is empty. Since the test case involves an empty input, this is causing an IndexError.

To fix this bug, the code should first check whether `self._cached` is empty before attempting to access its elements. If the list is empty, the code can simply append the sorted `commands` as the `_cached` list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_realise()` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if len(self._cached) == 0:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

With this corrected code, the function checks if `self._cached` is empty and then either sets it to the sorted `commands` or appends the sorted `commands` to it, based on the condition.
