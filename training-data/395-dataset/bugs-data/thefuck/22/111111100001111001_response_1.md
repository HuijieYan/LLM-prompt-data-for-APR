Analysis:
The error occurs when the _realise() function is executed. It seems that there is an issue with the _remove_duplicates() function, which is called within the _realise() function. 

The potential error is likely in the _remove_duplicates() function, where the type of the input parameter may not be appropriate for the operations performed inside the function. It is also possible that the corrected_commands variable is not being used properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The input parameter corrected_commands is expected to be a list, but it is being passed a list_iterator object. This could cause issues when trying to perform list operations inside the _remove_duplicates() function.
2. The _remove_duplicates() function is not actually removing duplicates from the corrected_commands list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Convert the list_iterator object to a list before passing it to the _remove_duplicates() function.
2. Modify the _remove_duplicates() function to actually remove duplicates from the corrected_commands list.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    return list(set(corrected_commands))

def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(list(self._commands))  # Convert list_iterator to list
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
