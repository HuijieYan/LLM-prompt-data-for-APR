The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" occurring in the `_realise` function of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class in the `thefuck/types.py` file. 

The potential error location seems to be in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted...` within the `_realise` function.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `_cached` list does not have any elements, so trying to access `self._cached[0]` is causing the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._cached` has at least one element before attempting to access its first element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if len(self._cached) > 0:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
