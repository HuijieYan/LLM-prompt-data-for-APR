The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 85 of the `thefuck/types.py` file. The problematic function is `_realise` and it seems that the error occurs in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted...`.

The potential error location within the function is accessing `self._cached[0]` when `self._cached` is an empty list. This is causing the "IndexError: list index out of range".

The bug occurred because the function did not check if `self._cached` was empty before trying to access its first element.

To fix this bug, you can implement a check to see if `self._cached` is empty. If it is empty, simply assign it to the sorted `commands` list. If it's not empty, then add the first element of `self._cached` to the sorted `commands` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if not self._cached:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `self._cached` is empty. If it is, it will assign it to the sorted `commands` list. If it's not empty, it will add the first element of `self._cached` to the sorted `commands` list.
