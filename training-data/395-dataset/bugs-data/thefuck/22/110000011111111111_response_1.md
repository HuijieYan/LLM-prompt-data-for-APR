The error message indicates an "IndexError" at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`, which suggests that the list `self._cached` is empty and we are trying to access its first element.

The potential error location is at the line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
    commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```
The bug occurs because it attempts to access the first element of `self._cached` when it is empty, causing an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `self._cached` is empty before trying to access its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if `self._cached` is not empty. If it is not empty, we proceed to access its first element. Otherwise, we directly assign the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`.
