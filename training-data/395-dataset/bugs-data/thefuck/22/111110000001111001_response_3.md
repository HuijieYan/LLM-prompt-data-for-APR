The potential error in the provided function is that it is attempting to access `self._commands` as a list, but it is actually a `list_iterator` type. This will cause an error when trying to perform list operations on `self._commands`.

The bug occurred because `self._commands` is being assigned a `list_iterator` object instead of a list.

To fix this bug, we need to convert `self._commands` to a list before performing any list operations on it.

```python
# corrected function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(self._remove_duplicates(list(self._commands)))
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `list()` function to convert `self._commands` to a list before passing it to the `_remove_duplicates` function and performing list operations on it. This will ensure that the code runs without any errors related to incorrect data types.
