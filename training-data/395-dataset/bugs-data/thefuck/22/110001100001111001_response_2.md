The bug in the given function is that it is trying to call the method `_remove_duplicates` on the class instance `self`, but it is not an instance method. The `_remove_duplicates` method should be a static or class method, or it should be a regular method that takes an instance as the first parameter.

In this case, the `_remove_duplicates` method is intended to be a regular method, so it should take `self` as the first parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_remove_duplicates` method and the `_realise` method:

```python
# Corrected function source code
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    return corrected_commands

# corrected function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, I added a `return` statement to the `_remove_duplicates` method to return the `corrected_commands` after removing duplicates. I also updated the `_realise` method to call `_remove_duplicates` correctly.

With these changes, the `_remove_duplicates` method now takes `self` as the first parameter, and the `_realise` method calls it correctly.
