Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. This suggests that `self._cached` does not have any items which is causing the `IndexError`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `_realise` method is attempting to access the first element of `self._cached`, but it seems that `self._cached` is empty or does not have any elements at the point when this method is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self._cached` is empty before attempting to access its first element.
2. Handle the case when `self._cached` is empty to avoid the `IndexError`.
3. Ensure that `_realise` is being called after `self._cached` has been populated with an element.

Corrected code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
