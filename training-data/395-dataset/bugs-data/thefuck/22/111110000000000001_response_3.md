Potential error location: 

The potential error occurs within the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)` where `self._cached` is being used without being defined.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because `self._cached` is being used in the `_realise` function without being defined, which leads to a NameError. Additionally, the logic for sorting the commands is not clear and can potentially lead to incorrect sorting.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Define `self._cached` before using it in the `_realise` function.
2. Use a clearer and more explicit approach for sorting the commands.

Corrected code:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [commands[0]] + sorted(
        commands[1:], key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
