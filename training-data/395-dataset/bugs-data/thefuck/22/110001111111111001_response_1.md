The error message indicates an "IndexError" which occurred on line 85 of the file `thefuck/types.py`. This error occurred within the `_realise` function while trying to access an index of an empty list.

The potential error location is this line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
    commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```
The error likely occurred because `self._cached` is an empty list, and the code is trying to access its first element, `self._cached[0]`, which doesn't exist.

The bug occurred because the `_realise` function did not handle the case where `commands` is an empty list, leading to the attempt to access the first element of an empty list

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to see if the `commands` list is empty before trying to access its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected _realise function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if commands:  # Check if the commands list is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

With this correction, the code will check if the `commands` list is not empty before trying to access its first element. If it is empty, the line that caused the IndexError will not be executed.
