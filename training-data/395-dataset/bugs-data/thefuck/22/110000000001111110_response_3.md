# Corrected function source code
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(set(self._commands))
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
The function has been corrected to remove duplicates from the commands list using the `set()` function and then convert it back to a list using the `list()` function. This will ensure that the commands are unique and then sorts the list.
