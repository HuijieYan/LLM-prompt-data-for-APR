Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)` inside the `_realise` method.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error message 'IndexError: list index out of range' indicates that the index being accessed, i.e., `self._cached[0]`, is out of range. This could be due to the fact that `self._cached` is empty, causing the index to be out of range.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `self._cached` is not empty before trying to access its first element. We can add a condition to check if `self._cached` is empty, and if so, initialize it with an empty list before adding the first element.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if not self._cached:
        self._cached = []
    
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
