Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is that the '_cached' attribute is being used before it has been defined within the function. It seems like the intention is to append the first element of '_cached' with the sorted 'commands', but since '_cached' is not defined, this will result in an error.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the '_cached' attribute is being used before it has been initialized or defined within the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Initialize '_cached' with an empty list before appending any elements to it.
2. Check if '_cached' is already defined and if not, define it as an empty list before using it.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached'):
        self._cached = []
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
