The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` with the list index out of range in the `_realise` function of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class.

The potential error location within the `_realise` function is the line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
    commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```
The error occurs because `self._cached` is used on the right-hand side without being initialized, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element (`self._cached[0]`).

To fix the bug, we need to initialize `self._cached` correctly before using it. We can do this by checking if `self._cached` exists, and if not, setting it to an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if not hasattr(self, '_cached'):  # check if _cached exists
        self._cached = []
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

With this correction, the `IndexError` should no longer occur when running the test case.
