Potential error location: The _remove_duplicates function is being called within the _realise method, but the function is defined with a self parameter which indicates that it should be a method of a class.

Reasons behind the bug: The _remove_duplicates method should be a part of the class, but it is defined as a standalone function. This is causing an AttributeError when it is called within the _realise method.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define the _remove_duplicates method as a proper method within the class, ensuring that it takes the necessary self parameter.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

class ClassName:
    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
