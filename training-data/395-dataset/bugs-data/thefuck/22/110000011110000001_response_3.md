## Analyzing the buggy function

The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 85 of the SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence object. This suggests that the issue might be related to trying to access an index that is out of range in the _cached list.

## Potential error location

The potential error location is in the line where the _cached list is being modified: `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`

## Reasons behind the bug

The bug is likely occurring because the _cached list is empty when the function is called.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug

One possible approach to fix this bug is to initialize the _cached list with an empty list before trying to modify its elements. This will ensure that the list has at least one element when trying to access the first element.

## Corrected code

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
