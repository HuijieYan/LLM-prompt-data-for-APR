The error message indicates that the issue lies within the `_realise` method of the SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence class. Specifically, the error is an "IndexError: list index out of range" which occurs when trying to access `self._cached[0]` when `self._cached` is an empty list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when trying to access the first element of `self._cached` (`self._cached[0]`) without checking if the list is empty. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not handle the case when `self._cached` is an empty list.

To fix the bug, we should add a check to see if `self._cached` is empty before accessing its first element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
