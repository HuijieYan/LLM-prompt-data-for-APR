The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 85 of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class. Looking at the `test_with_blank` test function, it is trying to create a `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` object with an empty iterator and then check if it returns an empty list.

The potential error location within the `_realise` function is likely the line: 
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```

The bug occurs because `self._cached` is initially set to an empty list `[]`, and then we try to access `self._cached[0]`, which results in an IndexError since the list is empty. This causes the line to fail.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self._cached` is not empty before trying to access its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check if `self._cached` is not empty before trying to access its first element. If it's empty, we directly sort the `commands`. This avoids the IndexError that occurred before.
