The potential error in the provided function is that self._commands is of type list_iterator, which cannot be directly sorted. This is likely the reason for the error as it is attempting to sort a list_iterator.

To fix this, we need to convert the list_iterator to a list before sorting it. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(list(self._commands))  # Convert list_iterator to list
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
