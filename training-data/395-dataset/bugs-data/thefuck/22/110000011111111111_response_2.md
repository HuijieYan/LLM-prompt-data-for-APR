The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError" in the "_realise" method of the "SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence" class. The error occurs in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. This error occurs because `self._cached` is an empty list, and we are trying to access the first element in it, which does not exist.

The potential error location within the "_realise" method is the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. 

The bug occurs because the code is trying to access the first element of an empty list and use it in the creation of a new list.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self._cached` is not empty before trying to access its first element. If it's empty, we can directly assign the sorted "commands" to `self._cached`. If it's not empty, we can append the sorted "commands" to it.

Here's the corrected code for the "_realise" method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
