The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" on line 85 of the types.py file. This error suggests that an attempt is being made to access an index in a list that is out of bounds, meaning the list does not have an element at that index.

The potential error location within the _realise function is the line: 
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```
In this line, the program is trying to access the first element of `self._cached` list using `self._cached[0]`. However, it seems that `self._cached` list is empty, which is causing the IndexError.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `self._cached` is not empty before trying to access its first element. We can add a check to make sure `self._cached` has at least one element before trying to access it.

The corrected function would be:
```python
def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        if self._cached:
            self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        else:
            self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
