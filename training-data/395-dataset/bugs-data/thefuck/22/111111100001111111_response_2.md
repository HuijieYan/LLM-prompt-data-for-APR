The issue in the provided code seems to be with the `_remove_duplicates` function. It is defined both as a standalone function and as a method within the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class. 

The error seems to occur within the `_remove_duplicates` function when it is called with `self._commands` as an argument. The variable `self._commands` is a list_iterator object, and it seems that the `remove_duplicates` function is not handling this type correctly, resulting in a potential error.

One approach to fixing this is to modify the `_remove_duplicates` method to handle the `list_iterator` object properly and remove any duplicates from it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected _remove_duplicates method
    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        return list(set(corrected_commands))

    # corrected _realise method
    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(list(self._commands))
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, the `_remove_duplicates` method has been modified to convert the `list_iterator` to a list using `list()` and then remove duplicates using the `set()` function. This ensures that the duplicates are properly removed and the remaining unique values are returned.
