The buggy function `_realise` has a few issues. 

1. The variable `commands` is assigned the result of calling `_remove_duplicates` on `self._commands`, but `_remove_duplicates` function is not shown and could potentially be the cause of the bug.
2. After assigning `commands`, the code tries to access `self._cached[0]` without checking if `self._cached` is empty or not.
3. The `sorted` function is used with a lambda function as the key, but the attribute `priority` is accessed without any check if it exists within the `corrected_command` object.

To fix the issues, we need to make sure that `_remove_duplicates` function works correctly, add a check for `self._cached` before accessing its first element, and handle the case where `corrected_command.priority` might not exist.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(self._remove_duplicates(self._commands))  # convert the iterator to a list
    if self._cached:  # check if self._cached is not empty
        first_cached_command = self._cached[0]
    else:
        first_cached_command = None
    if commands:
        self._cached = [first_cached_command] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: getattr(corrected_command, 'priority', 0))  # use getattr to safely access priority attribute
    else:
        self._cached = []
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

This code first converts the `self._commands` iterator to a list, adds a check for `self._cached` before accessing its first element, and uses `getattr` to safely access the `priority` attribute of `corrected_command`.
