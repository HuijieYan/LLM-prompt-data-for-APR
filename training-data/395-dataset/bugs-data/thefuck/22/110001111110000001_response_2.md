The error message indicates that the bug is causing an IndexError, stating that "list index is out of range."

The potential error location is the line: 
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```

The reason behind this bug is that the `_cached` attribute is being accessed and modified, but it appears that it hasn't been defined yet. This is causing the "index out of range" error.

To fix this, we need to initialize the `_cached` attribute before trying to access and modify it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = []  # Initialize _cached attribute
    if len(self._cached) > 0:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
