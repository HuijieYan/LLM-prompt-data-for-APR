Potential Error Location: 
The error likely occurs on the line where `self._cached` is being accessed and manipulated.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that the index being accessed in `self._cached` is out of range. This could happen if `_cached` is an empty list. The code is trying to access an element from an empty list, hence the error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self._cached` is empty before accessing it and handle the case where it is empty.
2. If the intention is to add an element to `self._cached`, make sure it is initialized correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if not self._cached:  # Check if _cached is empty
        self._cached = [commands[0]] + sorted(
            commands[1:], key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
