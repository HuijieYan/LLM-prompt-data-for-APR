The error message indicates that the bug occurs in the `_realise` method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class. Specifically, the error is an IndexError: list index out of range, which is caused by trying to access the first element of an empty list.

The potential error location is in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...` inside the `_realise` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_cached` list is empty (`self._cached = []`), and the code is trying to access its first element (`self._cached[0]`). This leads to an IndexError because there are no elements in the list.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to first check if the `_cached` list is empty before accessing its first element. If the list is not empty, then proceed with the concatenation and sorting.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if _cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

By adding the check for the emptiness of the `_cached` list, the code now ensures that it won't try to access the first element of an empty list, which should prevent the IndexError.
