The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 85 in the `_realise` method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class.

After analyzing the code, it appears that the issue is due to accessing `self._cached[0]` without checking if `self._cached` is initialized. This is likely causing the "IndexError" when trying to access an index of an empty list.

To fix this issue, we should first check if `self._cached` is empty before accessing its first element. If it is empty, then we can directly assign the sorted `commands` to it.

```python
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        if not self._cached:
            self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        else:
            self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected `_realise` method, we first check if `self._cached` is empty. If it is, we assign the sorted `commands` directly to it. If it is not empty, we append the sorted `commands` to it after adding the first element of `_cached` to the list. This should fix the "IndexError" issue.
