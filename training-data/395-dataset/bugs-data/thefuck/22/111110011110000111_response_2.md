The error message is indicating an "IndexError: list index out of range" in the _realise function, specifically in the line where self._cached is being assigned a new value. This suggests that there is an issue with accessing an index that does not exist in the list.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely that self._cached[0] is being accessed without checking if it exists or not. If self._cached is an empty list, accessing the first element will cause an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that self._cached has at least one element before accessing it.

Here's the corrected code for the _realise function:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if len(self._cached) > 0:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the self._cached list has at least one element. If it does, we use the [self._cached[0]] as the first element in the sorted list; otherwise, we directly assign the sorted list to self._cached. This way, we avoid the IndexError caused by accessing an empty list.
