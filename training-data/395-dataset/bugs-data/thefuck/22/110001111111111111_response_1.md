The test function `test_with_blank` creates an instance of `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` with an empty iterator and then tests whether the resulting list is also empty. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurred at line 106 in the `thefuck/types.py` file, which is within the `_realise` method.

The potential error location is likely within the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`, specifically referencing `self._cached[0]`. Since `self._cached` is initially an empty list, trying to access index 0 will cause an `IndexError`.

The bug occurs because the code tries to access the first element of `self._cached` even though it's empty. It seems that the intention was to add the first element of `self._cached` to a sorted list. Additionally, the usage of `self._remove_duplicates` is incorrect, as it's used like a method while it should have been a regular function.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `self._cached` is not empty before accessing its first element. Additionally, we should define `_remove_duplicates` as a regular function and pass `self._commands` as a parameter to it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function 
def _remove_duplicates(corrected_commands):  # Change from method to regular function
    # ... implementation to remove duplicates ...
    pass

def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = _remove_duplicates(self._commands)  # Pass self._commands as parameter
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)  # If empty, just sort
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
