The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred at line 85, which is within the `_realise` method. The error occurred when trying to access `self._cached[0]` when `self._cached` is an empty list, leading to a "list index out of range" error.

The potential error location within the function is the line that tries to access `self._cached[0]` within the `_realise` method.

The bug occurred because the code did not handle the case when `self._cached` is an empty list.

To fix this bug, the code should first check if `self._cached` is empty. If it is, then it should directly assign `self._cached` to the sorted `commands` without concatenating `[self._cached[0]]`. This will prevent the "list index out of range" error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
