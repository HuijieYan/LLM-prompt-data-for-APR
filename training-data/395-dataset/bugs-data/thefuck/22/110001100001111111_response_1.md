Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the `_remove_duplicates` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `_remove_duplicates` function is not defined in the given code, but it is called in the `_realise` function. This is likely causing a NameError.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Define the `_remove_duplicates` function.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence:
    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        return list(set(corrected_commands))

    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        if len(self._cached) > 0:
            self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        else:
            self._cached = sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, the `_remove_duplicates` function is defined within the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class. It removes duplicates from the `corrected_commands` list by converting it to a set and then back to a list. Additionally, a check is added to the `_realise` function to handle the case where `self._cached` is empty before sorting the commands.
