The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the index being accessed is out of range, which suggests that there is an issue with the access to the index `0` in the `_cached` list in the `_realise` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely on this line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
    commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```

The error occurs because `self._cached` is an empty list, and when trying to access `self._cached[0]`, it results in an IndexError since there is no element at that index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self._cached` has at least one element before attempting to access it. This could be done by adding a check for the length of `self._cached` before accessing its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if len(self._cached) > 0:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
