Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line:
`self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)`

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `self._cached` variable is being used before it has been initialized. It seems like the intention is to add the first element of `self._cached` to the sorted `commands`, but the code does not handle the case where `self._cached` may be empty.

Possible Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Check if `self._cached` is not empty before using its first element.
2. Initialize `self._cached` with an empty list if it is not already initialized.
3. Add error handling in case `self._cached` is empty.

Corrected Code:
```python
    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        
        if not self._cached:
            self._cached = []
        
        if self._cached:
            self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
