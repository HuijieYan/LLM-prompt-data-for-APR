The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" occurring at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)` inside the `_realise` method. This suggests that the `_cached` list is empty and an index of 0 is being accessed, resulting in the IndexError.

The potential error location is the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)`.

The bug occurs because the `_cached` list is empty, and the code is trying to access `self._cached[0]`, leading to the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we should first check if `self._cached` is empty before trying to access its elements. If it is empty, we can directly assign the sorted `commands` to `_cached`. We can also remove the lambda function from the `sorted` function and directly pass the `priority` attribute as the key for sorting.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if not self._cached:  # Check if _cached is empty
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

By adding a check if `_cached` is empty and directly assigning the sorted `commands` to it if it is, we can prevent the IndexError from occurring. Additionally, we can improve the `sorted` call by directly using the `priority` attribute as the key for sorting.
