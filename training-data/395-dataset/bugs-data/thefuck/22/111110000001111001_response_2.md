The potential error in the `_realise` function is the usage of `self._cached` before it has been defined. The code tries to access `self._cached[0]` before any value has been assigned to `self._cached`, which can lead to an `IndexError`.

To fix this, we can initialize `self._cached` as an empty list at the beginning of the class. Then, we can check if it is empty before accessing the first element. If it is empty, we can skip sorting the commands and directly set `self._cached` to the sorted `commands`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._cached = []  # initialize the _cached attribute as an empty list

    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        if not self._cached:  # if _cached is empty
            commands = self._remove_duplicates(list(self._commands))  # convert list_iterator to list
            self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
            self._realised = True
            debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
                self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In this corrected code, we check if `self._cached` is empty before accessing `self._cached[0]`. If it's empty, we directly set `self._cached` to the sorted `commands`.
