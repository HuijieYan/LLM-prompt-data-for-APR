Potential Error:
The error is likely due to the usage of `command.script` without checking if the `command` object has a `script` attribute. 

Reason for the Bug:
The error may occur because the `command` object does not have a `script` attribute, resulting in an AttributeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can check if the `command` object has a `script` attribute before trying to access it.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if hasattr(command, 'script'):
        return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
    else:
        return ''
```
