The error occurs because the original `get_new_command` function takes a 'command' parameter, but then tries to access the 'script' attribute, which does not exist. This causes the function to return the original command string followed by '--staged', resulting in the incorrect output.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to properly handle the input command and add '--staged' to it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command[1] if len(command) > 1 else 'git diff')
```

This updated function checks if the input 'command' contains more than one element. If it does, it takes the second element and appends '--staged' to it. If the input 'command' contains only one element or is empty, it defaults to 'git diff --staged'.

With this change, the function can now handle different inputs correctly and should pass the test case provided.
