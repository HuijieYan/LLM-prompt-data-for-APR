The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to return the original command with the `--staged` argument appended to it. However, the current implementation incorrectly tries to access the `command.script` attribute, which does not exist. The correct attribute to access is `command.script` itself.

The approach for fixing the bug involves simply using the `command.script` attribute directly without any modifications.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
