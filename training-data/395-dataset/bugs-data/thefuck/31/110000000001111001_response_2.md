The buggy function `get_new_command` is attempting to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object to create a new command with the `--staged` flag appended. However, the `command` object is not defined within the function and it seems to be expecting an object with a `script` attribute.

Based on the provided information and the expected behavior, it seems like the `command` object should be an instance of a class, let's call it `Command`, with a `script` attribute.

The potential error location within the function is the use of `command.script` without specifying the class of the `command` object and whether it has a `script` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `Command` class with a `script` attribute and modify the function to properly access the `script` attribute of the `command` object.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```

In this corrected function, we assume that the `command` object is already an instance of a class that has a meaningful string representation. If that is not the case, the implementation of the `__str__` or `__repr__` method for the `Command` class may be needed.
