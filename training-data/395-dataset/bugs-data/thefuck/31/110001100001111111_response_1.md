The buggy function `get_new_command` takes a `command` and `settings` as input and returns a modified command with `--staged` appended to it. However, it is currently accessing `command.script` directly, which may not always exist and can lead to an AttributeError.

To fix this, we can modify the function to check if `command.script` exists before using it in the return statement.

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    script = command.script if hasattr(command, 'script') else ''
    return '{} --staged'.format(script)
```
