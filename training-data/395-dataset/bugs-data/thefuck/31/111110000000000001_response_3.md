Potential Error Location: The error may be occurring due to the use of the `@utils.git_support` decorator, which is not defined in the provided code.

Reason for the Bug: The `@utils.git_support` decorator is being used without being defined or imported in the given code. This is causing a NameError and preventing the function from working as intended.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define or import the `@utils.git_support` decorator if it is part of a module or library.
2. If `@utils.git_support` is a custom decorator, make sure it is correctly defined and implemented to avoid any errors.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Assuming @utils.git_support is a custom decorator
import utils

@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
