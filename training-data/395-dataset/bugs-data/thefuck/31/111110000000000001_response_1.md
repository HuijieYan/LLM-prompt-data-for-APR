Potential Error:
The error is likely to occur in the line `return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)` because the `command` object likely does not have a `script` attribute.

Reason for Bug:
The `command` object does not have a `script` attribute, which leads to an AttributeError when attempting to access it.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We need to check the attributes of the `command` object and use the appropriate attribute to construct the new command.

Corrected Code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```

In the corrected code, we are using the `command` object directly to construct the new command, and there is no attempt to access a non-existent `script` attribute.
