The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to append the string '--staged' to the `command.script` and return the result. The bug in the function is that it is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter directly, but in the buggy function definition, it is treating `command` as an object with a `script` attribute.

The bug occurs because the `command` parameter is actually an instance of a `Command` class, so accessing the `script` attribute directly will give an attribute error. To fix this, we need to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

By using the `command` object directly and accessing the `script` attribute, we can correctly append '--staged' to the command and return the result.

With this correction, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
