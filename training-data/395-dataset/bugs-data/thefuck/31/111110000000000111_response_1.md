The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to access the 'script' attribute of the command object, but the 'script' attribute does not exist in the command object.

The reason for the bug is that the function is trying to access a non-existent attribute 'script' of the command object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to accept the command as a string instead of an object, as it seems to only require the command name.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```
