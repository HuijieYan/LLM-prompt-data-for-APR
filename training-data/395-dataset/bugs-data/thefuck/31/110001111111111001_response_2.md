The issue lies in the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to append the `--staged` option to the input command, but it incorrectly appends it at the end instead of after "git diff".

The buggy function incorrectly returns the modified command by appending `--staged` at the end of the command string, resulting in the incorrect command as seen in the error message.

To fix this, the function should split the input command string by whitespace, insert `--staged` at the second position, and then join the components back into a single string.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    command_parts = command.script.split(' ')
    new_command = ' '.join([command_parts[0], '--staged'] + command_parts[1:])
    return new_command
```
