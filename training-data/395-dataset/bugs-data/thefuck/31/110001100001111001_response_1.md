The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to append `--staged` to the `command.script` and return the modified command. However, the function is incorrectly accessing `command.script` instead of `command`.

The bug occurs because the `get_new_command` function is attempting to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object directly, when it should be accessing the `script` attribute of the `command` object's attribute.

To fix this bug, the function should access `command.script` and then append `--staged` to it.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return Command(script='{} --staged'.format(command.script), stdout='', stderr='')
```

With this correction, the function now correctly modifies the command script by appending `--staged` to it and returns the modified command.
