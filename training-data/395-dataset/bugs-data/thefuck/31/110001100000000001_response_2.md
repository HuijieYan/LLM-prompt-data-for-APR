The potential error in the problematic function is the use of the variable 'command.script' without it being defined. It seems like 'command' is expected to be an object with a 'script' attribute, but this is not guaranteed.

The bug occurred because the 'command' parameter does not have a 'script' attribute, so attempting to access it will result in an AttributeError.

To fix this, we can pass the 'command' directly instead of trying to access an attribute. We can also add a check to ensure that the 'command' object has the necessary attribute, and if not, return an error message.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# this is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if hasattr(command, 'script'):
        return '{} --staged'.format(command)
    else:
        return "Command script not found."
```
