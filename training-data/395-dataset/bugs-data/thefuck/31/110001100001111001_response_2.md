The provided function is supposed to add `--staged` to the end of the command.script string. However, the implementation is incorrect as it only returns the modified string without taking into account the original command with possible options and arguments.

The bug occurs because the function simply appends `--staged` to the `command.script` without considering the original options and arguments that might be passed with the command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the original command and append `--staged` at the end.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return Command(script='{} --staged'.format(command.script), stdout='', stderr='')
```

This modification ensures that the original command along with any options or arguments is preserved, and `--staged` is appended at the end.
