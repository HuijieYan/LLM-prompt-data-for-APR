The buggy function `get_new_command` takes a `command` object and returns the command with `--staged` appended. The bug seems to be that it is not handling the `command.script` properly.

The error message from the test function shows that for the input `Command('git diff foo')`, the function returns `'git diff foo --staged'` instead of the expected `'git diff --staged foo'`.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

The bug occurs because `command.script` is not being split properly to add `--staged` in the correct position.

To fix the bug, the `command.script` string should be split at the first space, and `--staged` should be added before the rest of the string. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split(' ', 1)
    if len(parts) > 1:
        return '{} --staged {}'.format(parts[0], parts[1])
    else:
        return '{} --staged'.format(parts[0])
```
