Potential error location: The error likely occurs because the `command.script` attribute does not exist, and it should be replaced with `command.script_parts`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `command` object likely does not have a `script` attribute, causing the function to fail.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Replace `command.script` with `command.script_parts` to access the split command script parts.

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return ' '.join(command.script_parts) + ' --staged'
```
