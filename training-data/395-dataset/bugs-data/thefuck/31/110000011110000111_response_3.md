The error occurs because the function `get_new_command` is not correctly adding the `--staged` option to the provided command.

The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is the line `return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)`. This line simply appends `--staged` to the end of the command script, which is incorrect.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not correctly modifying the provided command to add the `--staged` option.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function should be modified to ensure that it correctly adds the `--staged` option to the command, while preserving any additional arguments if they exist.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    script_parts.insert(2, '--staged')
    return ' '.join(script_parts)
```

With this corrected function, the provided test cases should pass without any errors.
