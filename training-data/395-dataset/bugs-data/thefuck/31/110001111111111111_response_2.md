The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect use of `command.script`. The function is currently returning `command.script` followed by `--staged`, resulting in the incorrect order of the arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to properly handle the command and its arguments. We should check if there are any arguments in the `command.script` and then append `--staged` to the command with the arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if ' ' in command.script:
        command_parts = command.script.split(' ', 1)
        return f'{command_parts[0]} --staged {command_parts[1]}'
    else:
        return f'{command.script} --staged'
```

With this correction, the `--staged` option will be appended correctly after the command and its arguments. This should resolve the bug and address the assertion error in the test functions.
