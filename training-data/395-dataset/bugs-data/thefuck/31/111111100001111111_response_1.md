The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to return the new command by appending `--staged` to the input command's script. However, it is not accessing the `script` attribute of the `command` object correctly.

The bug is occurring because the function is trying to access the `script` attribute directly from the `command` object, which is not the correct way to access attributes of the `command` object.

To fix this bug, the correct approach is to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object using the `command.script` syntax.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return Command(script='{} --staged'.format(command.script), stdout='', stderr='')
```

This corrected code correctly accesses the `script` attribute of the `command` object and forms the new command with `--staged` appended to the original command's script.
