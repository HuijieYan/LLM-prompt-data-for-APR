The provided function is attempting to use a decorator `@utils.git_support`, but the code for this decorator is not provided. This is the potential error location within the code.

The bug occurs because the `get_new_command` function is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `Command` object, but it should be accessing the `command` attribute instead.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to correctly extract the `script` from the `command` object. The corrected code for the function would be:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

This change allows the function to use the `script` attribute of the `Command` object correctly, leading to the expected behavior in the test cases.
