The error occurs because the get_new_command function is incorrectly appending --staged to the given command's script, rather than building a new command with --staged.

To fix this bug, we should modify the get_new_command function to correctly build a new command with --staged appended to it.

Here's the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    # Split the command's script and arguments
    script_args = command.script.split(' ')
    # Append --staged to the script
    script_args.append('--staged')
    # Join the script and arguments back together
    return ' '.join(script_args)
```

This corrected code will correctly append --staged to the command's script and return the new command. This should resolve the error in the test case.
