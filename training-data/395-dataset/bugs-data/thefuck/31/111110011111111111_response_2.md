The buggy function `get_new_command` is expecting a `Command` object as the `command` parameter, but it is trying to access `command.script` directly which is causing the bug. It should access `command.script` as an attribute of the `Command` object.

The error is occurring because the function is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter directly, which is not the correct way to access attributes of an object. It should access the `script` attribute of the `Command` object by using `command.script`.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to access the `script` attribute of the `Command` object by using `command.script`. The corrected function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

This fix ensures that the `script` attribute of the `Command` object is accessed correctly, regardless of the input parameters.
