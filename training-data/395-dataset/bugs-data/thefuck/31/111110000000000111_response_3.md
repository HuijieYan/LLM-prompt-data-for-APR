Potential error location: The error is likely related to the 'git_support' decorator being used in the function.

Reason for the bug: The function is using a 'git_support' decorator but it's not defined or implemented anywhere in the provided code, causing a NameError.

Approach for fixing the bug: Define or implement the 'git_support' decorator in the code. Assuming that the decorator should handle git related functionality, it should be implemented with the appropriate git related logic.

Corrected code:

```python
import utils

# Assuming the git_support decorator is defined and implemented in utils
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return utils.git_support('{} --staged'.format(command.script))
```
