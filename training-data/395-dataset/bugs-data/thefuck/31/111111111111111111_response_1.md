The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to append the `--staged` flag to the `command.script` value. However, the buggy implementation is using `command.script` directly, which cannot provide the desired output.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The incorrect usage of `command.script` instead of `command`.
2. The incorrect formatting of the new command.

To fix this bug, the function should use `command.script` to append the `--staged` flag and return the new command in the correct format.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    new_command = '{} --staged {}'.format(command.script, ' '.join(command.script.split()[1:]))
    return new_command
```

With this correction, the test function should now pass for both input cases.
