Potential Error: The function is trying to access the 'script' attribute of the 'command' object, but the 'command' object does not have a 'script' attribute.

Reason for the bug: The 'command' object does not have a 'script' attribute, so trying to access it will result in an error.

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the function to correctly access the command and append '--staged' to it.

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```
