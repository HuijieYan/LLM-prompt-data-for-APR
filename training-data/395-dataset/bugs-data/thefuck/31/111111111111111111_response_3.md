Potential error location: The buggy function `get_new_command` is not properly handling the input `command`. It only appends `--staged` to the `command.script` attribute, which leads to incorrect behavior when `command.script` contains additional arguments like in Buggy case 2.

Reasons behind the bug:
The function only considers `command.script` and does not handle additional arguments that might be present in the `command` object. This causes incorrect command generation when there are additional arguments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to construct the new command by incorporating the original command script and adding `--staged` to it, considering any additional arguments.
2. Use a parsing approach to separate the command and its arguments and then construct the new command with `--staged`.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from collections import deque

@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    command_tokens = command.script.split()
    new_command_tokens = deque(command_tokens)
    new_command_tokens.appendleft('--staged')
    return ' '.join(new_command_tokens)
```
