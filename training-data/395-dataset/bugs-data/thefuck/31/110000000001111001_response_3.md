The potential error in the provided buggy function is the use of `command.script` as if `command` is an object with a `script` attribute, whereas `command` is actually an instance of the `Command` class. 

The reason for the bug is that the `command` object does not have a `script` attribute, but rather the `script` attribute is part of the `Command` class.

To fix this bug, we need to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object instead of trying to access it directly. We also need to handle the case where `command.script` is empty.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script:
        return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
    else:
        return ' --staged'
```
