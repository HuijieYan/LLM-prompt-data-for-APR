The issue in the `get_new_command` function is that it is incorrectly appending the `--staged` flag to the end of the command, instead of before any additional arguments that come after the main command. This is causing the test to fail because the expected output is different from the actual output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle appending the `--staged` flag in the correct position.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if len(parts) > 1:
        return '{} --staged {}'.format(parts[0], ' '.join(parts[1:]))
    else:
        return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

This corrected function will split the command script into parts and add the `--staged` flag before any additional arguments that come after the main command. This should resolve the error in the test case.
