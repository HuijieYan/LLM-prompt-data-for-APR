The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to add the `--staged` flag to the provided command. However, in its current form, it is trying to access the `script` attribute directly from the `command` object, which doesn't exist. 

The error occurs because the `command` object does not have a `script` attribute.

To fix this bug, we can directly access the `command`'s `script` attribute instead of trying to access it through `command.script`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# this is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return f"{command.script} --staged"
```

In this corrected code, we directly use the `script` attribute of the `command` object and add the `--staged` flag to it.
