The problematic function is `get_new_command`. The issue with this function is that it appends `--staged` to the end of the `command.script` instead of after the initial command `git diff`.

Given the expected new command for the buggy cases, it is evident that the `--staged` flag should be inserted after the initial command, not at the end of the `command.script`.

To fix the bug, the corrected function is as follows:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged{}'.format(command.script, ' ' + command.script.split(' ', 1)[1] if len(command.script.split(' ', 1)) > 1 else '')
```

This corrected code will handle both cases, appending '--staged' after the initial command in the command script. This should resolve the issues identified in the test cases.
