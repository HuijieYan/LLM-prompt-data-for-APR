The bug in the code is that the `get_new_command` function is attempting to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, but the `script` attribute does not exist. Instead, it should be accessing the `command` attribute.

The error message indicates that the function is returning 'git diff foo --staged' instead of 'git diff --staged foo'.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `get_new_command` function to use the `command` attribute instead of `command.script` to retrieve the command script.

The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.command)
```
