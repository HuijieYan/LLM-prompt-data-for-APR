The issue with the provided function is that it is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, but the `command` object does not have a `script` attribute. Instead, the `script` value should be accessed directly from the `command` parameter.

Additionally, the `@utils.git_support` decorator is not defined, so it may be causing an error.

To fix the function, the following corrections should be made:

1. Remove the `@utils.git_support` decorator.
2. Access the `command` parameter directly to get the `script` value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```

With these changes, the function will correctly access the `script` value from the `command` object and will not rely on any undefined decorators.
