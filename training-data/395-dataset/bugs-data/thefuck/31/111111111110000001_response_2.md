Potential error location: The problematic line is `return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)`. This line is adding `--staged` to the end of the command script, which is not the desired behavior.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the original function simply appends `--staged` to the end of the command script, regardless of its position or presence.

Approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the position of `--staged` in the command script. We can use regular expressions or string manipulation to insert `--staged` after the `git diff` command.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'git diff', 'git diff --staged', command.script)
```
