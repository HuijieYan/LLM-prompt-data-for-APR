The buggy function `get_new_command` is encountering an issue with the placement of the `--staged` flag. The function is currently formatting the command with `--staged` at the end, which is causing the mismatch in the test case results.

The bug occurs because the function is using `command.script` directly and appending `--staged` at the end, which is incorrect. Instead, it should use the `command.script` and then add `--staged` with the appropriate format, considering the presence of additional arguments in the command.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if ' ' in command.script:
        base_command, remaining_args = command.script.split(' ', 1)
        return '{} --staged {}'.format(base_command, remaining_args)
    else:
        return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

In the corrected code, we split the command by the first space to separate the base command and the remaining arguments. Then, we format the new command appropriately with `--staged` inserted at the correct location. This ensures that the `--staged` flag is added at the appropriate position in the command.
