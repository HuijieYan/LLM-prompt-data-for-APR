The error occurs because the existing function `get_new_command` is not correctly handling the `command` parameter, specifically the `command.script` attribute. The function is simply appending `--staged` to the script attribute of the `command` object, regardless of its content.

To fix this, the `get_new_command` function needs to check if the script already contains "--staged" before appending it. If it already contains "--staged", then it should not be added again.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if "--staged" in command.script:
        return command.script
    else:
        return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
