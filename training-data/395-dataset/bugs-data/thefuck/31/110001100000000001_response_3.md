Potential error location: The buggy function is returning the input command followed by "--staged", but it is incorrectly accessing the command with "command.script" which does not exist.

Reasons behind the bug: The function is trying to access a non-existent attribute "script" of the "command" argument.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to properly access the command script to append "--staged" to it.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```
