The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a command and return the new command with the `--staged` flag appended to it. The bug occurs in the function due to the incorrect use of the `.script` attribute of the `command` object.

The error message from the test function shows that the expected new command should be 'git diff --staged foo', but the actual new command returned by the function is 'git diff foo --staged'. This indicates that the `--staged` flag is being appended in the wrong position in the command string.

To fix the bug, the code should format the new command as '{} --staged {}'.format(command.script, command.script_args) to correctly place the `--staged` flag after the command.  Additionally, the function should be updated to handle cases where the command has additional arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged {}'.format(command.script, ' '.join(command.script_args))
```

This should solve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
