The error in the test case is due to the incorrect behavior of the `get_new_command` function. The function should append `--staged` to the existing command, but instead, it is placing it at the end. This is causing the test case to fail because the expected output is `'git diff --staged foo'` but the function is returning `'git diff foo --staged'`.

The bug is in the `get_new_command` function. Instead of appending `--staged` to the end of the command, it should add it immediately after the command.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function should be modified to use string concatenation to add `--staged` to the command immediately after the command itself.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged{}'.format(command.script, ' ' + command.args if command.args else '')
```
