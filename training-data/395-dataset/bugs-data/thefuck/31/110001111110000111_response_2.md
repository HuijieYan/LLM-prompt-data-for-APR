The bug in the `get_new_command` function results from the fact that the function is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, which does not exist.

The likely reason for the bug is that the `command` object does not have a `script` attribute, so when the function tries to access it, it returns an empty string, which causes the subsequent `return` statement to concatenate an unexpected string.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to access the `command`'s `script` attribute. If the `script` attribute is not available, it should default to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return f"{command.script or ''} --staged"
```

In this corrected version, the `f"{command.script or ''} --staged"` expression will check if the `command.script` attribute is available. If it is, it will use it; otherwise, it will default to an empty string.

With this corrected function, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
