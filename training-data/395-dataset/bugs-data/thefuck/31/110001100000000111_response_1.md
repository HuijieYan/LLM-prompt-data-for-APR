The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to access the `command.script` attribute, which does not exist. This is likely causing the bug in the function.

The bug occurred because the function is trying to access an attribute `script` of the `command` object, which is not a valid attribute.

To fix this bug, we should access the `script` attribute from the `command` object directly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
