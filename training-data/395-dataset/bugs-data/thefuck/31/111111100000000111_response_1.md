The potential error in the provided function is that the `command.script` is not a valid attribute. The intended behavior is likely to append `--staged` to the command, but the current implementation attempts to access an attribute `script` which does not exist.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to append `--staged` directly to the command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```

In the corrected code, we removed the unnecessary `.script` attribute and directly appended `--staged` to the `command`. This should fix the bug and provide the intended behavior for the function.
