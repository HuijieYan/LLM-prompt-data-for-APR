The buggy function is `get_new_command(command, settings)`. The function takes a `Command` object `command` and a `settings` parameter as input and returns a modified command string.

Looking at the test case and error message, it seems that the buggy function is not correctly appending the `--staged` option to the `git diff` command.

The reason behind the bug is that the buggy implementation is simply appending `--staged` to the original command's script, but it should be appending it as an argument to the command.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to append `--staged` as an argument after the original command's script.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged {}'.format(command.script, ' '.join(command.script_parts[1:]))
```

This implementation separates the first part of the command script (the original command) from the rest of the script's parts and appends `--staged` followed by the remaining parts of the original command's script.
