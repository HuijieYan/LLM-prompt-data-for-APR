The test case is checking the output of the `get_new_command` function for the input `Command('git diff foo')` and expects the output 'git diff --staged foo'. However, the function is currently returning 'git diff foo --staged', which is incorrect.

The potential error in the function is the way the command is being concatenated with the string '--staged'. The current implementation is using `command.script`, which is not the correct variable to use.

The reason for the bug is that the concatenation is not correctly placing the '--staged' option. It is directly appending '--staged' at the end of the command without any space, and it should come before the file 'foo' in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to change the way the command and '--staged' string are concatenated.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command`:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged{}'.format(command.script, ' ' + command.script.split(' ', 1)[1] if len(command.script.split(' ')) > 1 else '')
```

With this correction, the function should return the correct output for the test cases provided.
