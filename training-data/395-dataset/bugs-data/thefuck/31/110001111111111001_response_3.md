The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a `command` and `settings` as input parameters, and then return the updated command with `--staged` appended to it.

The error message from the test function is showing that the actual output of the `get_new_command` function is not matching the expected output, based on the test cases provided.

The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is the line `return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)`. This line is using `command.script` to construct the new command, but it does not append the rest of the original command after '--staged'.

The reason for the bug is that the buggy function is concatenating the command with '--staged' without considering the rest of the original command.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to concatenate the rest of the original command after '--staged'.

Here's the corrected function for `get_new_command`:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged {}'.format(command.script, ' '.join(command.args))
```

This modification ensures that the original command and its arguments are preserved while appending '--staged' to the new command.
