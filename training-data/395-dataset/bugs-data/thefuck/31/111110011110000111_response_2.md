The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is using `command.script` instead of just `command` to access the command string. This causes the `--staged` option to be appended to the end of the command script instead of being inserted in between the command and the argument.

To fix the bug, the function should access the `script` attribute directly from the `command` object without trying to extract it from `command.script`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```
