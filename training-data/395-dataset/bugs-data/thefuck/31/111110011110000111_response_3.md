The error is occurring because the `get_new_command` function is incorrectly concatenating the input `command.script` with `--staged` instead of replacing `--staged` with `command.script`. This results in the incorrect order of the command and `--staged` flag.

To fix this issue, the `get_new_command` function should be modified to correctly generate the new command by replacing `--staged` with `command.script`.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return command.script.replace('diff', 'diff --staged')
```

With this correction, the function will now replace `diff` with `diff --staged`, allowing the test case to pass without any assertion errors.
