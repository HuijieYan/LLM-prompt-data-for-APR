The potential error in the given function is in the way the overridden_aliases variable is being handled. The function is supposed to split the overridden_aliases by commas and return a list of stripped aliases. However, it currently does not handle the overridden_aliases that are passed as input correctly. 

The reason for the bug is that the function is not handling the input overridden_aliases properly. It is assuming that the input will always be a string from the os environment, but it doesn't consider the case where overridden_aliases is passed as an input parameter.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the function to accept an optional overridden_aliases parameter and use it if it is provided, otherwise fall back to the value from the os environment.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self, overridden_aliases=None):
    if overridden_aliases:
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        aliases_from_env = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if aliases_from_env:
            return [alias.strip() for alias in aliases_from_env.split(',')]
        else:
            return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```

With this modification, the function will first check if overridden_aliases is provided. If it is, it will split the input and return the list of aliases. If not, it will fall back to the value from the os environment.
