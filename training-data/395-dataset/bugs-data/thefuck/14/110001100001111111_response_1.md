The bug in the code is that the function is not correctly parsing the overridden aliases and returning them as a list. Instead, it is returning the default values.

The potential error location is the line where the overridden_aliases are being split and converted into a list.

The bug occurs because the code is using the split(',') function to split overridden_aliases into a list, but it is not correctly handling the spaces around the commas. So, the split function is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to split the overridden_aliases based on the comma ',' and then strip each alias to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_14/thefuck/shells/fish.py
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```

With this correction, the function will correctly split the overridden aliases string and return a list of aliases.
