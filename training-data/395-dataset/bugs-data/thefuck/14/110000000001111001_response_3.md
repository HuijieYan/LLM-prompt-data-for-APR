Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the if condition `if overridden_aliases`. It checks if the `overridden_aliases` variable is not empty, but it does not handle the case when the variable is not empty but contains only spaces. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `.strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the environment variable value. If the environment variable contains only spaces, it will not be considered as empty, leading to the incorrect assumption that there are overridden aliases.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that even if the environment variable contains only spaces, it is considered as empty. One way to do this is by modifying the if condition to explicitly check for empty strings after stripping the whitespace.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases and overridden_aliases.strip():  # Check for empty string after stripping whitespace
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
