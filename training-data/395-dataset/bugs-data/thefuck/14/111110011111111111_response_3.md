The code provided is attempting to retrieve a list of overridden aliases by splitting a string from the environment variable `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES`. The bug in the code is that it is returning a list when the expected type is a set. Additionally, the test cases are being failed due to the incorrect comparison of the returned value from the function with a set.

To fix the bug, the code needs to return a set instead of a list, and the test cases should compare string sets instead of lists.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Set
import os

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _get_overridden_aliases(self) -> Set[str]:
        overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if overridden_aliases:
            return {alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')}
        else:
            return {'cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open'}
```

By making these changes, the function will now return a set, which aligns with the expected type based on the test case. Furthermore, the comparison in the test cases needs to be adjusted to compare the returned set with the expected set.
