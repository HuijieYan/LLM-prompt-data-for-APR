Potential error location: The potential error is in the `overridden_aliases` variable, as it is initialized as an empty string and then checked for its truthiness in the if statement.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `overridden_aliases` variable is being checked for its truthiness, but it is not a boolean value. This will cause issues as any non-empty string will be evaluated as True, even if it does not contain any valid aliases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by explicitly checking whether the `overridden_aliases` variable is empty or not, using the `if` statement to handle the different cases.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases != '':
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
