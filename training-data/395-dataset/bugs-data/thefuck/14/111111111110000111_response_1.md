Potential Error Location: The `assert` statement in the test case compares the output of `shell._get_overridden_aliases()` with a set that includes 'grep' as a member. Since 'grep' is not part of the default return value of the buggy function, this assertion will always fail unless 'grep' is added to the default list returned by the function.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function returns a default list that does not include 'grep' even though the test case expects it to be part of the output set. This mismatch causes the assertion to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add 'grep' to the default list of aliases returned by the function.
2. Update the test case to reflect the actual expected output from the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_14/thefuck/shells/fish.py

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
        overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if overridden_aliases:
            return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
        else:
            return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']  # Added 'grep' to the default list
```
