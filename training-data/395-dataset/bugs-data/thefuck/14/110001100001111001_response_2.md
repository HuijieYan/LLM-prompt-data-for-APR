The bug in the provided function is that it is referencing `self` as a parameter but is not defined within the function. Since `os` module is being used within the function, it's likely that the `os` module is not imported.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error is likely on line 3, where `os` module is being used without being imported.

Reasons for the Bug:
The `os` module is not imported within the function, leading to a NameError when trying to use `os.environ`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the `os` module at the beginning of the file.
2. Provide the `os` module as an argument to the function if it's being called from a class method.

Corrected Code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_14/thefuck/shells/fish.py
import os  # Importing os module

def _get_overridden_aliases(os):  # Passing os as an argument
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
