The test case is checking the output of the `_get_overridden_aliases` function. The function is expected to return a set of aliases. The error message is showing that the function returned a list of aliases instead of a set, and the content of the returned value is also incorrect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the return statement. The function should return a set of aliases, but it's currently returning a list with an incorrect content.

The bug occurred because the function is not converting the list of aliases into a set before returning it. This results in the incorrect type being returned and also incorrectly formatted aliases.

To fix the bug, the function should convert the list of aliases into a set before returning it. Additionally, the function should handle the input parameter (aliases) to ensure it contains valid values. Assuming the input parameter is not currently being used in the function, it can be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Set

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _get_overridden_aliases(self) -> Set[str]:
        overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if overridden_aliases:
            return {alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')}
        else:
            return {'cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open'}
```

With this corrected code, the function will return a set of aliases, and the test case should pass without any errors.
