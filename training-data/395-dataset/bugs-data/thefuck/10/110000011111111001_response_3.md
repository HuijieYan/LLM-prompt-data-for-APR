The buggy function `get_new_command(command)` has several issues. It first checks for the presence of '3' or '2' in the input command.script but then directly replaces those values. After that, it attempts to manipulate `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` without considering the input and its structure. Lastly, it returns a list containing various manipulated command script parts which results in incorrect outputs.

The issues identified are:
1. The function directly replaces '3' with '2' and vice versa, which is not contextually correct.
2. Manipulating `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` without a proper understanding of the command structure and context.
3. Returning a list containing various manipulated command script parts which results in incorrect outputs.

To fix these issues, the corrected function is provided below:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' not in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script and '3' not in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
        help_command = last_arg + ' --help'
        return [help_command, command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script.replace("2", "3")]
```

This corrected function first checks for the presence of '2' or '3' in the input command.script, then replaces '3' with '2' or '2' with '3' where it's appropriate. It then creates the help_command and returns a list containing the manipulated command script parts. This approach eliminates the unnecessary operations and directly manipulates the correct part of the command according to the context.
