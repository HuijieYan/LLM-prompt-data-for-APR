The test case is checking whether the `get_new_command()` function is returning the expected output for different `Command` inputs.

The potential error location is within the `get_new_command` function, where it is trying to replace '3' with '2' and vice versa, as well as appending elements to lists.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the conditional cases properly, leading to incorrect replacement of '3' and '2' and incorrect appending of elements to lists.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

This code should resolve the issues with conditional cases, string replacements, and appending elements to lists.
