Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely in the logic of the function where it is trying to replace '3' with '2' and vice versa.

Reasons for the Bug:
The function is not properly handling the case where both '2' and '3' are present in the command script. It currently only replaces '3' with '2' or '2' with '3' depending on which condition is met first, but it should replace all occurrences of '3' with '2' and vice versa.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the replace() method with both '3' and '2' in the script to replace both occurrences simultaneously.
2. Use a loop to iterate through each character in the command and replace '3' with '2' and vice versa.

Corrected Code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    command.script = command.script.replace("3", "x").replace("2", "3").replace("x", "2")
    return command
```

This corrected code uses the replace() method to replace '3' with a temporary character 'x', then replaces '2' with '3', and finally replaces 'x' with '2', effectively swapping the occurrences of '2' and '3'. This will handle the case where both '2' and '3' are present in the command script.
