Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the handling of the command.script input in the function. The function is trying to replace occurrences of '2' with '3' and vice versa, but it's not handling the script_parts correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function is directly working with the `command.script` string, but it should be using the `command.script_parts`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `command.script_parts` list to manipulate the command instead of directly using `command.script`.
2. Perform the required replacements and insertions on the `command.script_parts` list and then join them together to form the new command string.
3. Handle different cases of command strings such as 'man read', 'man 2 read', 'man -s2 read', etc., ensuring that the replacements and insertions are done correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    
    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]
    
    if '2' in split_cmd2:
        index = split_cmd2.index('2')
        split_cmd2[index] = '3'
    
    if '3' in split_cmd2:
        index = split_cmd2.index('3')
        split_cmd2[index] = '2'
    
    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')
    
    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
