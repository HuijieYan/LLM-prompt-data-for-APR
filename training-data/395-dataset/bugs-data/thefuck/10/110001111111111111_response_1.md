The issue with the function lies in the implementation of the logic for replacing '3' with '2' and vice versa. 

In the buggy function, the logic is implemented in such a way that it replaces the first occurrence of '3' to '2' in the command.script regardless of its position. Similarly, it replaces the first occurrence of '2' to '3' in the command.script regardless of its position. This causes issues in the test cases where specific patterns are expected. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the '2' and '3' replacements based on the specific position and context within the command.script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if ' 3 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 3 ", " 2 ")
    if ' 2 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 2 ", " 3 ")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2[1] = '2'
    split_cmd3[1] = '3'

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

The function now first checks for the presence of ' 3 ' and ' 2 ' in the command.script to ensure that it's replacing the correct values. Then, it replaces ' 3 ' with ' 2 ' and vice versa. It also uses " ".join to concatenate the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists with spaces in between elements. This should address the issues observed in the test cases.
