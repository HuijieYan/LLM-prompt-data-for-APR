The buggy function `get_new_command` seems to have issues with handling the command.script. It tries to replace the '3' with '2' and vice versa which can lead to incorrect command modifications in some cases. It also seems to have unnecessary and confusing logic for inserting '2' and '3' into the split commands when those numbers are not present in the original command.

To fix the function, we can simply replace '2' with '3' and vice versa without unnecessary replacements and insertions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        return command.script
```
