Potential error location:
The bug appears to be in the if conditions at the beginning of the function. It is not handling the scenarios where both '2' and '3' are in the command.script.

Reason for the bug:
The if conditions in the beginning of the function are not handling the case where both '2' and '3' are present in the command.script. As a result, it is only replacing one of them and not considering the other.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach is to use if-elif-else statements instead of separate if conditions. This way, both cases can be handled in a structured manner.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2").replace("2", "3")
    elif '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
