The test case is designed to check the `get_new_command` function by providing different input commands and validating the output against the expected new command.

The potential error in the `get_new_command` function lies in the conditional statements. In the first conditional block, it is replacing '3' with '2' instead of checking if '3' is present in the command script. Similarly, in the second conditional block, it is replacing '2' with '3' instead of checking if '2' is present in the command script.

The buggy code is not correctly handling the conditional logic, which leads to unexpected behavior while processing the command.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition checks and replace them with proper logic to identify whether '2' or '3' is present in the command script and then perform the replacement accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

By using 'elif' to define the second conditional block, the correct logic for identifying '3' or '2' in the command script is established. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
