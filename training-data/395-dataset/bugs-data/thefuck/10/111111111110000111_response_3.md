The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is expected to manipulate the command based on the presence of specific strings (e.g., "2" or "3") in the input command. 

The error message from the test function provides valuable insight into the problem. It shows that the actual output of the `get_new_command` function does not match the expected output. Specifically, it lists the differing parts and indicates that there are additional or missing items.

Upon reviewing the function, it appears that the issue lies in the incorrect manipulation of the script. The function tries to directly replace "3" with "2" and vice versa, which does not account for the context of these characters within the command. Additionally, when constructing the output, it incorrectly inserts "2" or "3" and then joins the command parts without proper handling of the space characters.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to:
1. Check for specific rules related to "2" and "3" in the command.
2. Use conditions or regex to handle the replacements in a more context-aware manner.
3. Properly handle the insertion of "2" or "3" into the split command parts.
4. Correctly join the command parts to form the new command.

Fixed code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    if ' 3 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 3 ", " 2 ").split()
    if ' 2 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 2 ", " 3 ").split()

    last_arg = script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(script_parts[:-1] + ['3'] + [last_arg]),
        " ".join(script_parts[:-1] + ['2'] + [last_arg]),
    ]
```
