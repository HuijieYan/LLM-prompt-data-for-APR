The bug occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function accepts a `Command` object as input and tries to return a modified command based on the input command. It seems the function is designed to replace certain parts of the command script based on the presence of `'2'` or `'3'` in the `command.script`.

The bug arises from the fact that the function is trying to modify `command.script` directly, which is not possible. Instead, the function should operate on the `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the function lacks proper logical flow, as it tries to replace the occurrences of `'3'` before `'2', which can lead to conflicting replacements.

To fix this bug, the function can be revised to operate on `command.script_parts` and provide separate conditional branches to handle the different replacements. By following this approach, we can ensure that the replacements are applied correctly based on the script parts.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts

    if '3' in script_parts:
        new_script_parts = [part.replace('3', '2') for part in script_parts]
    elif '2' in script_parts:
        new_script_parts = [part.replace('2', '3') for part in script_parts]
    else:
        new_script_parts = script_parts

    last_arg = new_script_parts[-1]
    help_command = last_arg + ' --help'

    return [help_command] + [' '.join(new_script_parts)]
```

With this corrected function, we handle the different cases for script modification, ensuring that the replacements are applied correctly. This should address the issues observed in the test cases and enable the function to produce the expected output.
