The issue with the given function is that it is trying to directly access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, but it should be actually accessing the `command.script` attribute as it is the string value we want to modify.

Also, the logic used to modify the script when '3' or '2' is present is not consistent. It should simply swap '3' with '2' and vice versa.

Additionally, there are unnecessary steps in the function that can be simplified.

Here's the corrected code for the given function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script = command.script  # Access the script attribute directly

    if '3' in script:
        return script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in script:
        return script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            script.replace("2", "3"),
            script.replace("3", "2"),
        ]
```

By modifying the function as shown above, it will correctly handle the script attribute, fix the swapping logic, and simplify the steps for generating the final output without any unnecessary manipulations.
