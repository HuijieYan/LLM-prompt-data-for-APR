The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to modify a given command based on its structure, specifically replacing '2' with '3' and vice versa. 

The error seems to be with the replacement logic. The function only replaces '3' with '2' and '2' with '3', but it does not consider the context in which these digits appear. It should only replace '2' and '3' as standalone characters within the command, not as part of another number or string.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to perform the replacements in a more precise manner, ensuring that '2' and '3' are replaced when they are standalone characters in the command.

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if ' 3 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 3 ", " 2 ")
    if ' 2 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 2 ", " 3 ")

    split_cmd2 = command.script.split()
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2[1] = '2'
    split_cmd3[1] = '3'

    last_arg = split_cmd3[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

This corrected code accounts for the precise context of the replacements, ensuring that '2' and '3' are replaced when they are standalone characters within the command. This should resolve the issues identified in the buggy cases.
