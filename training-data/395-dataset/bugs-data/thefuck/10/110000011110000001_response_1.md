The bug seems to be occurring within the `get_new_command` function. The function is not able to handle all the test cases properly.

The first issue in the function is that it checks for the presence of '3' in `command.script` and replaces it with '2'. Then it checks for the presence of '2' and replaces it with '3'. This logic will not work in all cases, and it doesn't handle multiple replacements.

One approach to fix the bug is to use a single `replace` statement and replace both '2' and '3' at the same time. We can also simplify the logic of adding '2' or '3' into the string. Additionally, we need to handle the case where no '2' or '3' is present in the command.

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        new_command = command.script.replace("3", "2")
    else:
        new_command = command.script.replace("2", "3")

    if '2' in command.script:
        new_command = command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd = command.script.split()
    if '2' in split_cmd:
        index = split_cmd.index('2')
        split_cmd[index] = '3'
    elif '3' in split_cmd:
        index = split_cmd.index('3')
        split_cmd[index] = '2'

    return [new_command, ' '.join(split_cmd) + ' --help']
```

This corrected function should handle the given test cases properly. It replaces '3' with '2' and '2' with '3', and handles cases where '2' or '3' is not present in the command.
