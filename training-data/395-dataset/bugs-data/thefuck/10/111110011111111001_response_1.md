The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it has inconsistent return types. In some cases, it returns a list, while in others, it returns a string. This inconsistency is causing the test cases to fail.

The buggy function is using the input script to determine which replacement to make, and it is then returning the new command either as a string or a list. This inconsistency in return types is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to consistently return a list of strings. We can construct the return value as a list and then convert it to a string if needed in the calling function.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("3", "2")]
    if '2' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("2", "3")]

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
    new_command1 = last_arg + ' --help'
    new_command2 = " ".join(command.script_parts[:-1] + ['3'] + [last_arg])
    new_command3 = " ".join(command.script_parts[:-1] + ['2'] + [last_arg])

    return [new_command1, new_command2, new_command3]
```

By consistently returning a list of strings, we ensure that the return type matches the expected outcome in the test cases. This should resolve the inconsistency and make the function behave as intended.
