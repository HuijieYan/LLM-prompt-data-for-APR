The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if conditions and the list returned.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The condition to check if '3' in command.script is being replaced with '2' but it should be replaced with '3' instead. Similarly, the condition to check if '2' in command.script is being replaced with '3' but it should be replaced with '2' instead.
2. The lists returned at the end contain the incorrect order of command parts.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Reverse the replacements in the if conditions.
2. Rearrange the order of the command parts in the returned list.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 3 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 2 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd2),
        "".join(split_cmd3),
    ]
```
