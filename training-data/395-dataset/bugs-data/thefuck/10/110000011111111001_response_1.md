The issue with the `get_new_command` function lies in the conditionals and the subsequent string replacements. In the first conditional, if '3' is in the command.script, it replaces '3' with '2'. However, in the second conditional, if '2' is in the command.script, it replaces '2' with '3'. This leads to unnecessary replacements and incorrect behavior.

Additionally, the return statement at the end of the function returns a list of strings, but it should simply concatenate the strings.

To fix this, the function should first handle the cases where '2' or '3' are present in the command script and replace them directly. Then, if neither '2' nor '3' are present, it should add '2' and '3' to the script_parts and return the appropriate new command strings.

The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        new_script = command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        new_script = command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        new_script_parts_2 = command.script_parts[:]
        new_script_parts_3 = command.script_parts[:]
        new_script_parts_2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        new_script_parts_3.insert(1, ' 3 ')
        return [
            command.script_parts[-1] + ' --help',
            "".join(new_script_parts_3),
            "".join(new_script_parts_2),
        ]
    new_script = command.script

    return [new_script]


```
