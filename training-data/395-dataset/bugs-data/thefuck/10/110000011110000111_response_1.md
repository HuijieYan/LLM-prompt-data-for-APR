The potential error in the function `get_new_command` is that it does not handle the cases where both '2' and '3' are in the command.script. This could be the reason the test cases are failing, as the function does not produce the expected output in these scenarios.

The function only checks for '3' and '2' separately in the command script and replaces it accordingly. However, this approach is flawed as the '2' and '3' may both be present in the script, which the function does not handle.

To fix this issue, the function should first check if both '2' and '3' are present in the script and then perform the appropriate replacements or additions to the command_parts.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script = command.script
    
    if '3' in script and '2' in script:
        return script.replace('2', '3')
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

        if '3' in script:
            return [
                script.replace("3", "2"),
                ''.join(split_cmd2),
                ''.join(split_cmd2[:-1]) + ' 3 ' + split_cmd2[-1]
            ]
        elif '2' in script:
            return [
                script.replace("2", "3"),
                ''.join(split_cmd3),
                ''.join(split_cmd3[:-1]) + ' 2 ' + split_cmd3[-1]
            ]
        else:
            last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
            return [
                last_arg + ' --help',
                "".join(split_cmd3),
                "".join(split_cmd2),
            ]
```

By addressing the cases where both '2' and '3' are present in the script, the function should now produce the expected output and resolve the failing test cases.
