The potential error in the given function is that the function is trying to access properties of the 'command' object (such as '.script' and '.script_parts') directly, without defining it as a class or providing it as an argument to the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'command' object is not defined within the function, so the function does not know what 'command.script' and 'command.script_parts' refer to.

To fix this bug, the 'command' object should either be defined as a class with the necessary properties (script and script_parts) or be provided as an argument to the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command['script']:
        return command['script'].replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command['script']:
        return command['script'].replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command['script_parts'][:]
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command['script_parts'][-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

In the corrected code, the 'command' object is provided as an argument to the function, and its properties are accessed using dictionary notation (command['script'] and command['script_parts']).
