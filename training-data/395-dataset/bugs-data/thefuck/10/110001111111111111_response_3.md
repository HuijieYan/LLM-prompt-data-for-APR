The bug occurs in the `get_new_command` function. It appears that the function is designed to replace certain substrings within the input command and then manipulate it further before returning a list of commands. The bug occurs when the input command has multiple substrings that need to be replaced. In these cases, the function incorrectly processes the input and generates an incorrect output.

The reason for this bug is due to the incorrect use of string replacement and list manipulation in the function. It is not handling the cases where multiple replacements need to be made correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the cases where multiple replacements are required. This can be achieved by  using the `replace` function for string replacement and then joining the modified list to form the command.

The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script = command.script

    if '3' in script:
        return script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in script:
        return script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd = script.split()
        last_arg = split_cmd[-1]
        
        new_commands = []
        new_commands.append(last_arg + ' --help')
        
        split_cmd.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        new_commands.append(" ".join(split_cmd))
        
        split_cmd[1] = ' 3 '
        new_commands.append(" ".join(split_cmd))
        
        return new_commands
```

This corrected function should handle all the input test cases properly and return the expected output.
