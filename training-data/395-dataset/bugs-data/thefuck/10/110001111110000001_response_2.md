The error message indicates that the output of the `get_new_command` function is different from the expected new command in the test cases. This could be due to a mistake in the logic of the function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements. The logic currently only checks for the presence of '3' or '2' in the command.script, and replaces '3' with '2' or '2' with '3' respectively. Additionally, the conditional statements for splitting and inserting values are not properly handled.

The bug occurs because the conditional statements are not mutually exclusive. If both '3' and '2' are present in the command, the logic will replace '3' with '2' and then insert '2' before the command. This leads to incorrect results in the output.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the presence of both '3' and '2' in the command and handle them separately. Additionally, the splitting and inserting of values should be handled correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd = command.script.split()
        last_arg = split_cmd[-1]

        split_cmd.insert(1, '3')
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd[:]
        new_command_3 = ' '.join(split_cmd3) + ' --help'

        split_cmd[1] = '2'
        split_cmd2 = split_cmd[:]
        new_command_2 = ' '.join(split_cmd2) + ' --help'

        return [new_command_3, new_command_2, last_arg + ' --help']
```

With this corrected function, the logic checks for the presence of both '3' and '2', and then handles them separately as needed, ensuring the correct output for the given test cases.
