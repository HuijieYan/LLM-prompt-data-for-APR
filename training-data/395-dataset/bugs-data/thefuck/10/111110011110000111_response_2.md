The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle the case where both '2' and '3' are present in the input command. It also seems to have some incorrect logic when inserting '2' and '3' into the split commands.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the case where both '2' and '3' are present in the command. Instead, it only checks for the presence of '3' and '2' individually and replaces them in the command.

To fix the bug, the function should check if both '2' and '3' are present in the command. If both are present, it should return the original command. If only one of them is present, it should replace it with the other. If neither '2' nor '3' is present, it should append '--help' to the last argument of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' not in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script and '3' not in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
        return [
            last_arg + ' --help'
        ]
```

This fixed function checks for both '2' and '3' in the command and handles the replacements correctly. It also appends '--help' to the last argument if neither '2' nor '3' is present in the command.
