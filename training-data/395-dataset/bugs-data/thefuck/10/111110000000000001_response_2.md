Potential error location: The if statements are not properly structured, as they both check for the presence of '3' and '2' in the command script and return the replacement string immediately, not allowing the code to properly execute the rest of the function.

Reasons for the bug: The if statements return a value immediately if '3' or '2' is found in the command script, preventing the rest of the function from executing and causing partial replacement.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Restructure the if statements to check for '3' and '2' separately and perform the replacements.
2. Use a single if-else statement to ensure that only one replacement is made.
3. Use a different approach for replacing characters in the command script.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            "".join(split_cmd3),
            "".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```
