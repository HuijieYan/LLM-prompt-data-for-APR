Potential error location: The if statements are not connected a single if-elif-else structure, so both conditions can be true and the function will return the wrong result.

Reason for the bug: The function does not properly handle the case when both '3' and '2' are present in the command's script, leading to incorrect replacements and command construction.

Approach to fixing the bug: Use a single if-elif-else structure to properly handle the replacements and command construction based on whether '3' or '2' is present in the command's script.

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            "".join(split_cmd3),
            "".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```
