The potential error location is the logic for handling the '2' and '3' strings in the command script.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the cases where both '2' and '3' are present in the command script. It only checks for the presence of '3' or '2' individually and replaces them, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where both '2' and '3' are present in the command script. We can use the `replace` function for this purpose.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2").replace("2", "3")
    elif '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            "".join(split_cmd3),
            "".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```

This code first checks if both '2' and '3' are present in the command script and replaces them accordingly. If only '3' is present, it replaces '3' with '2'. If only '2' is present, it replaces '2' with '3'. If neither '2' nor '3' is present, it performs the existing logic.
