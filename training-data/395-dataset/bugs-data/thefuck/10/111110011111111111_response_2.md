The bug occurs in the "get_new_command" function. The issue arises from the logic to handle the commands containing '2' or '3', especially with the implementation of "split_cmd2" and "split_cmd3".

The buggy function attempts to replace '3' with '2' and vice versa in the command script. However, in some cases, the logic for replacing '3' with '2' or '2' with '3' is not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, the logic for replacing '3' with '2' and '2' with '3' needs to be updated. Additionally, the formation of the "split_cmd2" and "split_cmd3" arrays should be revised to fit the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the "get_new_command" function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        command.script = command.script.replace("3", "2")
        return [command.script + ' --help']

    if '2' in command.script:
        command.script = command.script.replace("2", "3")
        return [command.script + ' --help']

    # Default case
    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(['man'] + command.script_parts),
        " ".join(['man'] + command.script_parts).replace("2", "3")
    ]
```

With this correction, the function logic is updated to properly handle commands with '2' or '3', and the correct values are returned based on the input command.
