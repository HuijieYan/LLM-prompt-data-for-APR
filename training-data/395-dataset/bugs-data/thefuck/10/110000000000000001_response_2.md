Potential error location: The main issue appears to be that the function is not properly handling the script string input and converting it into a list of commands.

Reasons behind the bug:
The function is not properly handling the replacement of '2' and '3' in the command.script. Additionally, the manipulation of split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 is not correct and may result in unexpected behavior.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. First, we should properly check for the presence of both '2' and '3' in the command.script.
2. If '3' is present, replace all instances of '3' with '2' before modifying the split_cmd3 list.
3. If '2' is present, replace all instances of '2' with '3' before modifying the split_cmd2 list.
4. Finally, construct the return list by adding the modified split_cmd2, split_cmd3, and the last_arg with '--help'.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        command.script = command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        command.script = command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
