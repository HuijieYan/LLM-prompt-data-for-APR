The buggy function is designed to modify a command script based on certain conditions. However, there are several issues with the function that need to be addressed.

1. The function is checking for '3' and '2' in the command.script, but it should be checking in command.script_parts.

2. The function is using the wrong variable name 'command.script' in the if conditions instead of 'command.script_parts'.

3. The function is using incorrect slicing of the list 'split_cmd2 = command.script_parts' as it should create a copy of the list using 'split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]'.

4. The return statement in the function is not consistent and does not provide the expected output.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script_parts:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    
    if '2' in command.script_parts:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
