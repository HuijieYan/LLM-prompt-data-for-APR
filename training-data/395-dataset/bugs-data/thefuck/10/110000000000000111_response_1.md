Potential Error: The logic in the function is incorrect and doesn't handle the scenarios properly. It only replaces '3' with '2' and '2' with '3' in the command.script, but it should also handle the case where both '2' and '3' are present in the command.script.

Reason for the Bug:
The function does not properly address the scenario where both '2' and '3' are present in the command.script. Additionally, the splitting of commands and insertion of '2' and '3' in the middle of the command.script is not handled correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if both '2' and '3' are present in the command.script and replace them accordingly.
2. Reconstruct the command.script splitting and insertion logic to ensure that it maintains the integrity of the original command.

Corrected Function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2").replace("2", "3")
    else:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2") if '3' in command.script else command.script.replace("2", "3")
```

In the corrected function, we first check if both '2' and '3' are present in the command.script. If they are, we replace them accordingly. If not, we handle the scenario where only one of '2' or '3' is present.
