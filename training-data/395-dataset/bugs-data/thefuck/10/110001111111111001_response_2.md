The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it returns a list of strings for some cases and a single string for others. This inconsistency causes the assertion errors in the test cases.

The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is the different return types based on different conditions. In some cases, it returns a list of strings, while in others, it returns a single string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is inconsistency in return types. The function should return the same type of output for all input cases.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the function returns the same type of output for all input cases. We can achieve this by making the function consistently return a list of strings.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("3", "2")]
    if '2' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("2", "3")]

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
