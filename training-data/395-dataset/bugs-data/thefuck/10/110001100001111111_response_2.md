Potential Error Location:
The buggy code has multiple issues. It tries to replace '3' with '2' or '2' with '3' in the command.script using the replace() method, which may lead to unintended replacements. Additionally, the function returns a list of strings in certain cases and a single string in other cases, which may lead to inconsistency.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The script tries to modify the command.script using replace() and wrongly constructs the list of strings for the return value. This inconsistency in the return type and unintended replacements make the function buggy.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use regular expressions to replace '2' or '3' in command.script to avoid unintended replacements.
2. Consistently return a single string or a list of strings based on the requirement.
3. Ensure that the modification of command.script does not affect its original value.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        script = re.sub(r'\b3\b', '2', command.script)
        return script
    elif '2' in command.script:
        script = re.sub(r'\b2\b', '3', command.script)
        return script
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')
        
        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
        
        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            "".join(split_cmd3),
            "".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```
