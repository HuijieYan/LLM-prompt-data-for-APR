The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it is trying to access `command.script` and `command.script_parts`, which are not defined within the function. 

The error message indicates that the output of the function does not match the expected new command. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `command` input.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to properly handle the `command` input. It seems the function is expecting `command` to have attributes `script` and `script_parts`, but these attributes are not defined on the `Command` object.

We need to modify the function to handle the `command` input properly and return the correct new command based on the given input.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'man 3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("man 3", "man 2")
    if 'man 2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("man 2", "man 3")

    if '-s2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("-s2", "-s3")
    if '-s3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("-s3", "-s2")

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
    return [last_arg + ' --help']
```

This modified function checks for the commands/flags such as `man 3`, `man 2`, `-s2`, and `-s3` and replaces them accordingly to return the new command. Also, it ends up appending `--help` in all cases. With this modification, the function should now be able to handle the `command` input properly and generate the correct new commands based on the given input.
