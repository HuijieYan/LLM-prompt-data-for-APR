The problem described in the error messages and the code provided suggests that the 'get_new_command' function is not working as expected. The function should return a modified command based on the input command, but instead it returns unexpected results.

The potential error in the code is related to the handling of the command in the 'get_new_command' function. There are issues regarding the insertion of split commands and the handling of command parts.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the command input and is not replacing the '2' with '3' and vice versa as intended.

To fix the bug, the command input should be properly manipulated based on the requirements defined in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_new_command' function based on the problem analysis:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd = command.script.split()  # Split command into parts
    for index, part in enumerate(split_cmd):
        if part == '2':
            split_cmd[index] = '3'
        elif part == '3':
            split_cmd[index] = '2'

    return [' '.join(split_cmd) + ' --help']  # Return the modified command
```

The corrected function now properly handles the replacement of '2' with '3' and vice versa. It also correctly constructs the new command based on the input command. This should resolve the issues identified in the error messages and the test cases.
