The error occurs because the function is not handling all the cases correctly. For example, for the input `Command('man missing', stderr="No manual entry for missing\n")`, the expected output is `['missing --help']` but the function returns `['missing --h...an 2 missing']`. Similarly, for the input `Command('man read')`, the expected output is `['man 3 read', 'man 2 read', 'read --help']` but the function returns `['read --help... 'man 2 read']`.

The potential error location within the function is at the `return` statement. The function is not correctly handling all the scenarios based on the input `command.script`.

The bug occurs because the function does not have specific handling for each case. It tries to replace "3" with "2" and vice versa, and also adds '2' and '3' to the `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` lists, but the logic lacks consistency and does not cover all cases accurately.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle all the different scenarios of `command.script` correctly and return the new command accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' not in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script and '3' not in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
        help_command = last_arg + ' --help'
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd2[1] = ' 2 '
        split_cmd3[1] = ' 3 '
        return [help_command, "".join(split_cmd3), "".join(split_cmd2)]
```

With this corrected code, all the scenarios are handled based on the input `command.script`, and the function should return the correct new command for each case.
