The buggy function `get_new_command` has several issues based on the test cases provided. The function is intended to modify command scripts based on certain conditions. However, the current implementation has logical errors, such as unnecessary conditional checks and incorrect list manipulations.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles command replacement. It should replace "2" with "3" and vice versa, but the current implementation replaces these characters without considering their original position in the command script.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
- Remove the unnecessary conditional checks and the initial replacements of "2" and "3".
- Create a list of commands where "2" and "3" are added to the command script in their respective positions.
- Return the modified command in the required format.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    split_cmd = command.script_parts
    
    # Replace '2' with '3' and vice versa
    for i, part in enumerate(split_cmd):
        if part == '2':
            split_cmd[i] = '3'
        elif part == '3':
            split_cmd[i] = '2'
    
    # Construct the output commands with the modified '2' and '3'
    modified_commands = []
    for i, part in enumerate(split_cmd):
        temp_cmd = split_cmd[:]
        temp_cmd.insert(i+1, part)
        modified_commands.append(' '.join(temp_cmd))
    
    return modified_commands
```

This corrected function properly handles the replacement of "2" and "3" in the command script, and returns the modified commands as required.
