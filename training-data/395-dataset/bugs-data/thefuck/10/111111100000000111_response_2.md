Potential error location: The problem seems to lie in the manipulation of the 'split_cmd2' and 'split_cmd3' variables.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 variable assignments are redundant and unnecessary.
2. The use of command.script_parts to split the command is incorrect and unnecessary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary assignment of split_cmd2 and split_cmd3.
2. Amend the use of command.script_parts to split the command script properly.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd = command.script.split()
    split_cmd.insert(1, '2')
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd[:]
    split_cmd3[1] = '3'

    last_arg = split_cmd[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd),
    ]
```
