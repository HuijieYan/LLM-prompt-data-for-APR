The function `get_new_command` is designed to take a command and return a modified version of the command, which is either the original command with the number 2 replaced by 3 or vice versa, or a list of commands with help or with the number 2 or 3 inserted.

However, the function is returning incorrect output for the given input test cases, leading to assertion errors.

Upon analyzing the code and the error message, it can be observed that in the buggy function, when the last_arg is being appended to the command.script_parts list, it's not taken into account the whitespace, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the code needs to correctly insert the required values into the command.script_parts list. Additionally, the if-elif-else conditions are not properly set up to handle the replacements, resulting in incorrect return values for replacements.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd = command.script_parts
        last_arg = split_cmd[-1]
        split_cmd.remove(last_arg)

        split_cmd2 = split_cmd[:]
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd[:]

        split_cmd.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 3 ')

        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            " ".join(split_cmd3),
            " ".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```

This corrected function handles the replacements and list manipulations properly. With these modifications, the function should return the expected output for the given test cases.
