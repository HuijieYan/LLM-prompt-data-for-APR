Potential error location: 
The issue is with the statement `if '2' in command.script`, this could result in replacing all occurrences of '2' with '3' even if the first conditional statement is true.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the second conditional statement is not exclusive to the first conditional statement. If the first conditional statement is true, it will still proceed to the next conditional statement, resulting in erroneous behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the second conditional statement to an 'else if' (elif) statement so that it only executes if the first condition is not satisfied.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
