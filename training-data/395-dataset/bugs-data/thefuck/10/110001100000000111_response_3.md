Potential error location: The conditional statements at the beginning of the function are not mutually exclusive, meaning that both conditions can be satisfied at the same time, leading to unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The conditional statements are not mutually exclusive, so if the command contains both '2' and '3', both conditions will be executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Make the conditional statements mutually exclusive so that only one condition is executed at a time.
2. Check and handle the case where both '2' and '3' are present in the command script.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
