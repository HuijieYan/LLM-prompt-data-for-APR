Potential Issue:
The function is overcomplicating the process of replacing '2' with '3' and vice versa in the input command. It is unnecessarily using lists and insert operations when a simple replace operation would suffice.

Reason for the Bug:
The function is unnecessarily using lists and insert operations, which is making it prone to errors. It is also not handling the cases where both '2' and '3' are present in the input command.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if both '2' and '3' are present in the input command and handle these cases separately.
2. Use the `replace` function to replace '2' with '3' and '3' with '2'.

Corrected Code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2").replace("2", "3")
    elif '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            command.script.replace("3", "2"),
            command.script.replace("2", "3"),
        ]
```
