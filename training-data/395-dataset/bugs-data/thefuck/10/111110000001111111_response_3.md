The buggy function `get_new_command` has several issues. It is meant to transform the input command based on the presence of the numbers '2' and '3'. The code has been written to replace '3' with '2' and vice versa, but there are some issues in the implementation.

The potential error location is in the if-else conditions and the replacement of '2' and '3' in the input command.

The reasons behind the bug are:
- The if-else conditions are not handling all scenarios properly.
- The replacement logic is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
- Split the command correctly and then compare each part while replacing '2' and '3' in the relevant parts.
- Add handling for other scenarios where '2' or '3' can occur in the command.

The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    for i, part in enumerate(split_cmd2):
        if part == '2':
            split_cmd2[i] = '3'
        elif part == '3':
            split_cmd2[i] = '2'
    
    for i, part in enumerate(split_cmd3):
        if part == '2':
            split_cmd3[i] = '3'
        elif part == '3':
            split_cmd3[i] = '2'

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
