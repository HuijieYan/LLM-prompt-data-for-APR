Potential error location: The issue lies in the three conditions at the beginning of the function, which only handle cases when '2' or '3' is found in the command. It does not consider other variations such as '2' or '3' followed by another command.

Reason for the bug: The function's initial conditions do not cover all possible cases, leading to incorrect outputs for scenarios when '2' or '3' is followed by another command in the input.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Include additional conditions to handle cases where '2' or '3' is followed by another command in the input.
2. Use conditional statements or regular expressions to check for all possible variations in the input command.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if ' 3 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 3 ", " 2 ")
    if ' 2 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 2 ", " 3 ")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
