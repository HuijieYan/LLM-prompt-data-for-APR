The bug occurs because the `update` function is not correctly updating the settings with the new values from `kwargs`. Instead of updating the settings, it is creating a new dictionary and returning it as a new `Settings` object.

To fix the bug, the `update` function should update the existing settings with the new values from `kwargs`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Update the existing settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

With this corrected implementation, the test cases should pass without any errors.
