Potential error location: The error is in the `update` method where the `Settings` class is not imported or defined. 

Reasons behind the bug: The `Settings` class is not imported or defined in the code which causes this error. 

Approach for fixing the bug: Define the `Settings` class or import it from the appropriate module before using it in the `update` method.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_29/thefuck/types.py

# import or define the Settings class
from settings_module import Settings

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected update method
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```
