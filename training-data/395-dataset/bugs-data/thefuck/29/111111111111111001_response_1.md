The issue with the `update` method is that it returns a new instance of `Settings` with the updated values, but it should update the existing instance instead. This is why the tests fail, as they are expecting the original instance with the updated values.

To fix this bug, the `update` method should be modified to update the current instance rather than returning a new one. Below is the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates settings with the values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
```

By updating the `self` instance with the new values in the `kwargs` parameter, the tests should pass as expected.
