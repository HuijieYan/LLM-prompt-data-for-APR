The issue in the buggy function is that it incorrectly creates a new Settings object by passing a dictionary to the constructor, instead of using the update method of the Settings class. This causes the conf variable to be of type dict instead of Settings.

To fix the bug, the conf variable should be updated using the update method of the Settings class, rather than directly creating a new Settings object.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.copy()  # Create a copy of the current settings
    conf.update(kwargs)  # Update the settings with the new values from kwargs
    return conf  # Return the updated settings
```
