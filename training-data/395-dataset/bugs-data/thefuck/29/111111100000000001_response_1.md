Potential Error location: 
The issue is with the `update` function in the `Settings` class. The function is supposed to update the existing settings with new values from `kwargs`, but it is returning a new instance of `Settings` with the updated values, instead of updating the existing instance.

Reason for the bug:
The `update` function should modify the existing `Settings` instance with the new values from `kwargs`, but instead, it creates a new instance with the updated values and returns it.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should update the existing `Settings` instance with the new values from `kwargs` instead of creating a new instance.

Corrected code:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates the existing settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

In this corrected code, we are using the built-in `update` function of the `dict` class to update the existing settings with the new values from `kwargs`. This will fix the bug and correctly update the existing instance of `Settings`.
