Potential Error Location: The update function creates a new dictionary 'conf' by copying the current Settings instance using dict(self). This means that the new Settings instance will not inherit any custom functionality or attributes defined within the Settings class.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because dict(self) creates a shallow copy of the Settings instance, but it does not create a new instance of the Settings class. As a result, the new attributes or methods defined within the Settings class are not included in the copied dictionary 'conf'.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to create a new instance of the Settings class with the updated dictionary values. This will ensure that the new instance inherits all the attributes and methods of the original Settings class.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # signature of the fixed function in this class
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        conf = dict(self)
        conf.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(conf)
```
