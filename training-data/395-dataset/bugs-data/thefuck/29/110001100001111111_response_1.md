The bug in the function is that it tries to create a new Settings object and pass the new dictionary to its constructor, but the constructor expects an instance of `Settings` and not a dictionary.

To fix this bug, we can change the `update` method to directly update the existing settings dictionary and return the updated `Settings` instance.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    new_settings = self.copy()
    new_settings.update(kwargs)
    return new_settings
```
