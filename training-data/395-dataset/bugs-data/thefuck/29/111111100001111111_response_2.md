The buggy function is the `update` method of the `Settings` class. This method is supposed to update the settings with new values from the `kwargs` parameter and return a new `Settings` object.

The issue with the current implementation is that when updating the `conf` dictionary with the new `kwargs`, it is also updating the original `self` settings instead of creating a new copy.

To fix this, we should create a new dictionary from the original settings (`self`), update it with the new `kwargs`, and then return a new `Settings` object with this updated dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)  # Create a new dictionary from the original settings
    conf.update(kwargs)  # Update the new dictionary with the new kwargs
    return Settings(conf)  # Return a new Settings object with the updated dictionary
```
