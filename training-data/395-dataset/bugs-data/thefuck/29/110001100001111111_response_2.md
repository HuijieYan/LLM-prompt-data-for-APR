The potential error in the problematic function is with the line `return Settings(conf)`. This line is attempting to return a new instance of the `Settings` class, but it's not clear if `Settings` refers to a class or an instance available within the function's scope.

The bug occurs because the `Settings` class or instance is not defined within the function scope, so trying to return it will result in an error.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `Settings` class or instance is properly defined and can be used to create a new object with the updated settings.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_29/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return conf  # return the updated settings as a dictionary
```
