The bug in the `update` function is that it is incorrectly creating the `conf` dictionary by taking the `self` parameter, which is an instance of the `Settings` class, and converting it to a dictionary using `dict(self)`. This approach doesn't correctly extract the settings from the `self` parameter.

To fix this issue, we should access the settings directly from the `self` parameter, update them with the values from `kwargs`, and then return a new instance of the `Settings` class with the updated settings.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.settings.copy()
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```

In this corrected code:
- We access the settings from the `self` parameter by using `self.settings`.
- We create a copy of the settings using `self.settings.copy()` to avoid modifying the original settings.
- We update the `conf` dictionary with the values from `kwargs` using `conf.update(kwargs)`.
- Finally, we return a new instance of the `Settings` class with the updated settings using `Settings(conf)`.
