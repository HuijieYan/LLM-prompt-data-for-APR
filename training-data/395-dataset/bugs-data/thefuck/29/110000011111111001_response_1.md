The potential error location within the problematic function is the `update` function. The function takes in `kwargs` as input, which represents a dictionary of new key-value pairs. It should merge these new key-value pairs with the existing ones in the `Settings` object and return a new `Settings` object with the updated values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the buggy function is creating a new dictionary `conf` and updating its values with the values from `kwargs`. However, the correct approach should be to update the existing settings with the values from `kwargs` and create a new `Settings` object with the updated values.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to update the existing settings (self) with the values from `kwargs` and then return a new `Settings` object with the updated values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.copy()  # Create a shallow copy of self
    conf.update(kwargs)  # Update conf with the values from kwargs
    return Settings(conf)  # Return a new Settings object with the updated values
```
