The bug in the provided update function is that it returns a new instance of the Settings class, rather than updating the existing instance with the new values. This causes the new_settings variable to not have the expected values in the test functions, resulting in assertion errors.

The reason for the bug is that the update method does not modify the existing instance of Settings but creates a new instance with the updated values.

To fix the bug, the update function should modify the existing instance and return it, instead of creating a new instance.

Here's the corrected code for the update function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected update function
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Update existing settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
```

With this correction, the update function will correctly update the existing instance of the Settings class with the new values from kwargs.
