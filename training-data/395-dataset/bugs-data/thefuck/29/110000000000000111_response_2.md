Potential error location:
The issue lies in the `update` method where it tries to create a new dictionary `conf` by copying the values from `self` and then updating it with the new `kwargs`. However, the initial dictionary copy should be `self.__dict__` instead of just `self`.

Reason for the bug:
The `dict(self)` tries to create a dictionary from the object `self` rather than its attributes, which results in an error. Instead, we need to access the attributes of `self` and create a dictionary from those attributes.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by using `self.__dict__` to create the dictionary from the attributes of the `self` object.

Corrected code:
```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self.__dict__)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(**conf)
```
