The buggy function `update` is intended to update the settings and return a new `Settings` instance with the updated values. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the merging of the existing settings with the new settings provided in `kwargs`.

The bug occurs because the `conf` dictionary is created using `self` (the existing settings) and then it is updated with the new values from `kwargs`. This results in the new `Settings` instance containing the merged values, but the original settings are also modified. This is not the expected behavior for the `update` function.

To fix this bug, we need to create a new dictionary with the combined settings from the existing settings and the new `kwargs`. Then, we should create a new `Settings` instance using this combined dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    combined_settings = dict(self)
    combined_settings.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(combined_settings)
```
