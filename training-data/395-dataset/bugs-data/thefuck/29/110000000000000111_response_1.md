Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the line `conf = dict(self)`. The `self` parameter seems to be an instance of a class, and directly converting it to a dictionary using `dict(self)` may not produce the expected result.

Reason for the bug:
The `self` parameter is likely an instance of a class and calling `dict(self)` directly may not create a new dictionary with the settings.

Approach to fix the bug:
Instead of using `dict(self)` to convert the instance to a dictionary, we can access the settings of the instance directly and then create a new dictionary.

Corrected code:
```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.copy()  # Assume the class has a `copy` method to make a shallow copy
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```
In this corrected code, we assume that the class has a `copy` method to make a shallow copy of itself, and then we update the settings with the values from `kwargs` and return a new instance of `Settings` with the updated settings.
