The error message from the test functions is asserting the incorrect value. When we call the `update` method on the `Settings` object, it should update the existing setting and return a new setting with the updated values. However, the bug is causing the incorrect value to be asserted.

The reason behind the bug is that the `update` method is returning a new `Settings` instance, but the updated values are not being assigned correctly. Instead of updating the existing settings, it is creating a new instance with the updated values. This is causing the new settings to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `update` method to update the existing settings with the new values and return the updated settings.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates existing settings with values from `kwargs` and returns the updated settings."""
        self.update(kwargs)
        return self
```

With this correction, the `update` method will correctly update the existing settings with the new values and return the updated settings. This should resolve the bug and the test functions should pass without any assertion errors.
