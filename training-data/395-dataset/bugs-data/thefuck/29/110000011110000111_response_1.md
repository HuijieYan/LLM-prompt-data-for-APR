The `update` method is designed to update the settings of an object and return a new instance with the updated settings. However, there are a few issues in the current implementation:

1. The `conf` variable is being assigned the dictionary representation of `self`, but since `self` is an instance of a class, it should use `vars(self)`.
2. The `update` method is creating a new `Settings` instance with the updated settings, but it's not updating the old instance itself.

To fix the issues with the `update` method, we need to make the following changes:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.settings = settings

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        updated_settings = {**self.settings, **kwargs}  # Update the settings with new values
        return Settings(updated_settings)  # Create a new Settings instance with the updated settings
```

With the above changes, the `update` method will properly update the settings and create a new instance with the updated settings, addressing the issues identified.
