The buggy function takes in a dictionary of keyword arguments and updates the `self` settings with the new values. However, the function is incorrectly returning a new `Settings` instance with the updated values instead of updating the existing `Settings` instance.

To fix this bug, modify the `update` method of the `Settings` class to update the instance's values directly, rather than creating a new `Settings` instance.

```python
class Settings(dict):
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates self with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
```

By directly updating the `self` instance with the new values, we ensure that the `Settings` object is modified in place, rather than creating a new instance each time the `update` method is called.
