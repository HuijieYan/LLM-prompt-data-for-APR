Potential error location: The error occurs within the `update` method of the `Settings` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the original code attempts to create a new dictionary (`conf`) from the existing settings, and then updates it with the provided `kwargs`. However, the existing settings is not a dictionary but an object of `Settings` class. This leads to a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Iterate through the `Settings` object and create a new dictionary with its attributes and values.
2. Use the `vars` method to convert the `Settings` object to a dictionary.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = vars(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```
