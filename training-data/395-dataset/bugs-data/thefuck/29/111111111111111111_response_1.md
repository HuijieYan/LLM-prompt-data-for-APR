The issue lies within the `update` method of the `Settings` class. It's expected to return a new instance of `Settings` with updated values. However, in its current state, it returns a `dict` instead of an instance of `Settings`.

The reason for the bug is that the `update` method should return an instance of the `Settings` class containing the updated values from `kwargs`. However, the current implementation returns a `dict` instead.

To fix the bug, the `update` method should be modified to return an instance of the `Settings` class containing the updated values.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected signature of the function in this class
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        conf = dict(self)
        conf.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(conf)
```

With this correction, the `update` method will return a new instance of the `Settings` class with the updated values from `kwargs`, as expected.
