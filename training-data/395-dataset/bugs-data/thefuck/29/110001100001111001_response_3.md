The error in the current function is that it is trying to create a new `Settings` object at the end by passing a dictionary `conf` to the `Settings` class, but it doesn't seem to be defined. It's likely that `Settings(conf)` is meant to create a new `Settings` object with the merged settings.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `update` function to create a new `Settings` object with the merged settings using the `update` method of the `dict` class. Then return the newly created `Settings` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_29/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

    # This is the corrected function
    def update(self, **kwargs):
       new_settings = dict(self)
       new_settings.update(kwargs)
       return Settings(new_settings)
```

With this correction, the `update` function will now return a new `Settings` object with the updated settings.
