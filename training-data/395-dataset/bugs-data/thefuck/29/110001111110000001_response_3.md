The issue in the `update` function lies in the way the new `kwargs` are updated into the `conf` dictionary. As per the error messages, the `kwargs` are not being updated correctly in the `conf` dictionary, leading to incorrect values being assigned when creating a new `Settings` instance.

The bug occurs due to incorrect merging of the existing settings dictionary and the new settings passed as keyword arguments. The `conf.update(kwargs)` line is not updating the dictionary with new values properly.

To fix the bug, the `update` function needs to be modified to correctly update the `conf` dictionary with the new settings from `kwargs` and then return a new `Settings` instance using the updated `conf` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_29/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.copy()  # Assuming self is a dictionary, use copy to create a new dictionary
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```

By using `self.copy()` instead of `dict(self)`, we ensure that a new dictionary is created, and then `update` adds or updates the key-value pairs into this copy. This corrected implementation should resolve the issues observed in the test cases.
