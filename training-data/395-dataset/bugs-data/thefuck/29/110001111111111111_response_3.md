The bug is in the `update` method of the `Settings` class. The issue arises from the way the `conf` dictionary is being updated with the new `kwargs`. When updating `conf` with `kwargs`, the original values of `conf` are not being overwritten as expected, resulting in incorrect values.

The potential error location is the line where `conf.update(kwargs)` is called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `update` method is not correctly updating the original values with the new values from `kwargs`, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug in the `update` method, we can use the `kwargs` directly to update the `conf` dictionary. We can replace the line `conf.update(kwargs)` with `conf = {**conf, **kwargs}`. This will merge the `conf` dictionary with the `kwargs` and create a new dictionary with the updated values.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf = {**conf, **kwargs}
    return Settings(conf)
```

With this corrected method, the values of `conf` will be updated correctly, and the test cases should pass without any errors.
