Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the update method in the Settings class, where it is attempting to return a new Settings object with updated values.

Reasons behind the bug: The current update method is creating a new dictionary `conf` by copying the existing settings, updating it with the new values from `kwargs`, and then returning a new Settings object with the updated values. However, it should directly update the existing settings and return the updated Settings object, rather than creating a new dictionary and then a new Settings object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of creating a new dictionary and then a new Settings object, the update method should directly update the existing settings with the new values from `kwargs` and return the updated Settings object.

Corrected code:
```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Update existing settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
    return self
```
