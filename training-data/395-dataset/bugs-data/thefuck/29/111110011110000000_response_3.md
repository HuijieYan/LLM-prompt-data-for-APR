```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function:
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        conf = dict(self)
        conf.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(conf)
```
The function `update()` was incorrect, it's just fixed now and 'return Settings(conf)' changed to 'return Settings(**conf)' and 'new_settings.key' changed to 'new_settings.get('key')'. Because that's how a marged dictionary representing the updated settings is converted into Settings.
