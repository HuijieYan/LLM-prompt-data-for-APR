The buggy function is the `update` method inside the `Settings` class. This method is supposed to return new settings with updated values from the given `kwargs`. However, the implementation of the method is incorrect, which leads to the test failures.

The error message from the test functions indicates that the updated values are not correctly being set in the new settings. This suggests that the `update` method is not updating the settings properly.

The issue with the existing implementation is that it creates a new dictionary `conf` to hold the updated settings and then returns a new `Settings` instance created from this dictionary. However, the values from the original settings are not carried forward to the new settings.

To fix the bug, the corrected `update` method should update the existing settings (self) by applying the changes from `kwargs` and return the updated settings itself.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Update settings with new values from `kwargs` and return the updated settings."""
        self.update(kwargs)
        return self
```

By modifying the original settings (`self`) with the new values from `kwargs` and returning the updated settings, the corrected method ensures that the values are updated properly. This should address the issues encountered in the test functions.
