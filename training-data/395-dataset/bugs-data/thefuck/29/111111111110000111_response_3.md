Potential error location: The buggy function is the "update" method within the "Settings" class. The issue likely arises from how the "update" method is creating a new instance of the "Settings" class and copying the settings into it.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The "update" method should not be creating a new instance of the "Settings" class but should instead modify the existing instance with the provided arguments.
2. The existing implementation creates a new dictionary "conf" with the current settings and then updates it with the provided settings using "conf.update(kwargs)". It then returns a new instance of "Settings" with the updated dictionary, creating an unnecessary new instance.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of creating a new instance of "Settings", the existing instance should be updated with the provided arguments.
2. Modify the "update" method to directly update the current "Settings" instance in place with the provided arguments without creating a new instance.

Corrected code for the "update" method:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Update the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, the "update" method directly updates the current "Settings" instance with the provided arguments, avoiding the unnecessary creation of a new instance.
