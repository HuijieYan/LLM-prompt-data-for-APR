Potential error location: The line `conf = dict(self)` is trying to convert `self` into a dictionary, which is most likely causing the error.

Reason for the bug: The `self` object is most likely not a dictionary, so trying to convert it into a dictionary is causing the error.

Approach for fixing the bug: The `update` function needs to handle the scenario where `self` is not a dictionary and update it accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.__dict__.copy()  # Create a copy of the object's attributes
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```
