The issue with the `update` function is that the old values in the `self` parameter are being used instead of being updated with the new values in the `kwargs` parameter. This is causing the function to not update the settings correctly and return incorrect results. 

To fix the bug, the `conf` dictionary should be updated with the values from `kwargs` instead of retaining the values from `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```

With this change, the `conf` dictionary will be updated with the new values from `kwargs`, and the `Settings` object will be created with the updated settings.
