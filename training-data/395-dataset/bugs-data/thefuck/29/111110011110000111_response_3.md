The buggy function in the given source code is the `update` method of the `Settings` class. The function is designed to update the settings with new values from `kwargs`, but it is not working as expected and causing assertion errors in the test functions.

The reason behind the bug is that the `update` method creates a new dictionary `conf` using the existing settings and then updates it with the new `kwargs`. However, the incorrect behavior lies in the fact that it should update the existing settings with the new `kwargs` instead of creating a new dictionary.

To fix the bug, the corrected version of the `update` method should directly update the existing settings with the new `kwargs` and return the updated settings.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
```

With this correction, the `update` method will now directly update the existing settings with the new `kwargs`, resolving the issues in the test functions.
