Potential error location: The line `conf = dict(self)` is attempting to convert `self` into a dictionary, which is not supported by the `dict` constructor when used on an object.

Reason for the bug: The `dict` constructor cannot be used to convert an object into a dictionary. This is likely causing the function to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `vars()` function to convert the object `self` into a dictionary.
2. Create a new dictionary and manually populate it with the attributes of the `self` object.

Corrected code:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = vars(self).copy()  # This line converts the object to a dictionary
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(**conf)  # Create a new Settings object with the updated dictionary
```
