The potential error in the given code is that the `update` method is returning a new `Settings` instance, but it should be updating the existing instance instead.

The bug occurs because the `update` method is creating a new `Settings` instance with the updated configuration, rather than updating the current instance.

To fix this, the `update` method should update the current instance with the new values from `kwargs`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

In this corrected code, the `update` method is updating the current instance with the new values from `kwargs`.
