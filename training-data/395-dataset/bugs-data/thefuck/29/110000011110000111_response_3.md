The issue in the provided code is that the `update` method is not correctly updating the `conf` dictionary with new values from `kwargs`.

The potential error location is the line `conf = dict(self)` as it is trying to convert the class instance `self` to a dictionary, which is not the correct approach to copy the data.

The reason for the bug is that the `dict(self)` is not the correct way to copy the data from the settings object. It creates a dictionary with the attributes of the class object but it does not capture the actual key-value pairs from the settings.

To fix this bug, the correct approach is to copy the key-value pairs from the original settings to the new dictionary `conf`, and then update `conf` with new values from `kwargs`. After that, we can create a new instance of the `Settings` class using the updated `conf` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.copy()  # Create a shallow copy of the settings
    conf.update(kwargs)  # Update the copy with new values
    return Settings(conf)  # Return a new instance with the updated settings
```

This corrected implementation ensures that the settings are properly updated with new values and a new instance of the `Settings` class is returned. This should fix the bug and make the test cases pass.
