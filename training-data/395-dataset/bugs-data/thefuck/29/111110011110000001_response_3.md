The update function in the Settings class is currently returning a new instance of the Settings class with the updated values. However, in the test cases, it seems that the expected behavior is to update the original instance of the Settings class without creating a new one.

The bug is occurring because the existing update function is creating a new instance of the Settings class with the updated values instead of modifying the original instance. This behavior is causing the assertions in the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the update function should modify the original instance instead of creating a new one. This can be achieved by updating the original dictionary in place and returning None, or simply updating the instance attributes directly without creating a new instance.

The corrected code for the update function in the Settings class is as follows:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
```

By modifying the original instance instead of creating a new one, the test cases should now pass as expected.
