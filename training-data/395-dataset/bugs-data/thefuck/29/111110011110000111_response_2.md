The update function in the Settings class is intended to update the settings with new values from `kwargs`. The intention is to merge the existing settings with the new values and return a new Settings object with the updated values.

The error occurs because in the current implementation, the new settings are not being correctly updated. Instead of updating the existing keys in the settings, the function is returning a new Settings object with only the new values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the update function to correctly update the existing settings with the new values and return the updated settings.

Here's the corrected code for the update function:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates settings with new values from `kwargs` and returns the updated settings."""
        conf = dict(self)
        conf.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(conf)
```

The changes made correct the function's behavior to correctly update the existing settings with the new values and return the updated settings. This should resolve the issues in the test cases provided.
