The problematic function is the `update` method in the `Settings` class. It is intended to return a new `Settings` object after updating its values with the provided `kwargs`.

There is an issue with the current implementation of the `update` method. It is creating a new dictionary `conf` by using the `dict` constructor with `self` as the input, and then updating `conf` with the `kwargs`. This approach is not correct because `self` is an instance of the `Settings` class, and using the `dict` constructor in this way will not preserve the `Settings` class properties.

To fix the bug, the update method should use the `copy` method of the `Settings` class to create a new instance, update the new instance with the provided `kwargs`, and then return the new instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    new_settings = self.copy()
    new_settings.update(kwargs)
    return new_settings
```

This approach ensures that the `Settings` class properties are preserved and returns a new `Settings` instance with the updated values.
