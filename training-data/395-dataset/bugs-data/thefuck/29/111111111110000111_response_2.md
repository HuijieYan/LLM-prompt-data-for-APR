## Analysis
The error messages suggest that the `update` function in the `Settings` class is not working as expected. It is updating the settings incorrectly, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.

## Error Location
The potential error location within the `update` function is the line where the `conf` dictionary is being updated with the given `kwargs`.

## Reasons for the Bug
The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `update` function is creating a new `Settings` instance every time it is called, instead of updating the existing `Settings` instance with the new values. This leads to unexpected behavior and failed assertions in the test cases.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `update` function should update the existing `Settings` instance with the new values from `kwargs` instead of creating a new instance every time.

## Corrected Code
```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```
