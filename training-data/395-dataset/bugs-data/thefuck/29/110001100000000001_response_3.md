The potential error in the code is that the `update` method is trying to create a new `Settings` object using the `conf` dictionary, but it's missing the `Settings` class to create the new object.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `Settings` class and create a new object using the `conf` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_29/thefuck/types.py

from settings import Settings  # import the Settings class

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)  # create a new Settings object with the updated conf dictionary
```
