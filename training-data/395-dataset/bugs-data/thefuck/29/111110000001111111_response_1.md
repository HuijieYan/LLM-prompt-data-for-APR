The issue with the `update` method is that it is returning a new instance of the Settings class, but it should be updating the existing instance with the new values from `kwargs`. 

The potential error location is in the line `return Settings(conf)` which is creating a new instance instead of updating the existing one.

The bug occurs because the `update` method should modify the existing instance of the Settings class with the new key-value pairs from `kwargs`, but instead, it creates a new instance with the combined key-value pairs.

To fix the bug, we can update the existing instance `self` with the new key-value pairs from `kwargs` and return the modified instance instead of creating a new one.

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates existing settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
        return self
```
