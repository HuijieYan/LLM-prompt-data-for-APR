The potential error in the problematic function is that it is not updating the current settings with the new values from `kwargs` as intended. Instead, it creates a new dictionary `conf` with the updated values and returns a new Settings instance with the updated values.

The error occurs because the `update` method should actually update the current settings with the new values, but it is currently not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to update the current settings with the new values from `kwargs` and then return the updated settings. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Update settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
        return self
```
