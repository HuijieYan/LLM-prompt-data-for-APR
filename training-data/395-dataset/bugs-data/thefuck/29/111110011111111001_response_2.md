The buggy function `update` is supposed to return a new instance of `Settings` with updated values from the `kwargs` dictionary. However, there are issues with the current implementation:

1. In the buggy implementation, the `update` method is creating a new `dict` and updating its values with the input `kwargs`. This results in the creation of a regular `dict` instead of a new `Settings` instance, which is the expected behavior.

2. The current implementation does not preserve the existing settings in the `Settings` object, leading to the loss of all non-updated settings from the original instance.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `update` method to create a new `Settings` instance with the combined settings from the current instance and the provided `kwargs`. This will ensure that the original settings are preserved and the new settings are added or updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `update` method:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected implementation of the update method
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        new_settings = Settings(self)  # Create a new Settings instance with the existing settings
        new_settings.update(kwargs)  # Update the new instance with the provided kwargs
        return new_settings
```

With this corrected implementation, the `update` method will create a new `Settings` instance containing the original settings along with the updated values from `kwargs`, addressing the issues mentioned earlier.
