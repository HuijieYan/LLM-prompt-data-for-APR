Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the line "conf = dict(self)". It seems that the intention was to create a copy of the self dictionary, but the current implementation is incorrect.

Reason for the Bug: The error occurs because the "dict" function cannot be used to create a dictionary from a class instance (self). This is likely causing the function to fail.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, we need to create a copy of the dictionary using the "copy" method of the dictionary class, or by using the dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as the original one. Once the copy of the dictionary is made, we can safely update it with the new values from the kwargs.

Corrected Code:
```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.copy()  # Create a copy of the dictionary
    conf.update(kwargs)  # Update the new dictionary with the values from kwargs
    return Settings(conf)  # Return the new settings
```
