The bug in the `get_new_command` function seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `fixcolcmd` variable when formatting the `editor_call`.

Upon analyzing the test cases and error messages, it appears that the issue arises from the incorrect formatting of `editor_call` with the `fixcolcmd` in the function. In several test cases, the expected `editor_call` includes both the line and column numbers, but the actual `editor_call` generated by the function only includes the line number, resulting in assertion errors.

The reason for this bug is that the logic in the `get_new_command` function is not properly utilizing the `fixcolcmd` in all cases. The condition `if test[3]:` checks if the `test` variable has a truthy value at index 3, but it should actually be checking for the existence of `test[3]`. This results in incorrect inclusion or exclusion of column numbers in the `editor_call`. Additionally, the formatting of the `editor_call` for cases where `test[3]` exists is incorrectly using `test[3]` for the column number, which should actually be `test[3]:test[4]` to correctly include both the line and column numbers.

To fix this bug, the `get_new_command` function should be modified to handle the `fixcolcmd` variable correctly. The formatting of `editor_call` should always include the line number, and if the column number exists, it should be included as well.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = f"{os.environ['EDITOR']} {m.group('file')} +{m.group('line')}"
    if 'fixcolcmd' in settings:
        editor_call += f":{m.group('col')}" if 'col' in m.groupdict() else ""
    
    return f"{editor_call} && {command.script}"
```

With these changes, the `editor_call` will always include the line number, and if the column number exists in the input, it will also be included. This should address the bug and make the function work correctly for the given test cases.
