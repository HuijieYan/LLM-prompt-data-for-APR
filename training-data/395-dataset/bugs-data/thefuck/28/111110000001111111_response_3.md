The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it is trying to access `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`, assuming they have a method named `group` to extract data using regular expression. However, in the buggy code, there is no information about the classes `Command` or `Settings` from which `command` and `settings` objects are created. Additionally, the code also uses a `shells.and_` method which is not accessible in the buggy code.

To fix this function, first, we need to properly define the `Command` and `Settings` classes. Then, we need to make sure that `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` are valid and have the expected format for the regular expression implementation. Finally, we need to handle the case where `m` is `None` after the `_search` function is called.

Given the complexity of this issue and the lack of detailed information about the classes `Command` and `Settings`, it's not feasible to provide a specific fix. However, a possible approach would involve modifying the `Command` and `Settings` classes to ensure they have the required attributes and methods, as well as handling the case where `m` is `None` after the search.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function assuming the `Command` and `Settings` classes have been properly defined and the regular expression match is successful:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    if m:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         m.group('file'),
                                         m.group('line'))
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        return "No match found"
```
In this corrected code, we first check if `m` is not `None` before using the `group` method to avoid potential errors. If `m` is `None`, we return a message indicating that no match was found.

This correction is based on several assumptions due to the lack of detailed information about the classes and methods used in the original code. Further investigation and understanding of the context in which this function operates would be required for a more accurate fix.
