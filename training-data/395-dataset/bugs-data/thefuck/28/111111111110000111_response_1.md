The error in this code seems to be related to the way the `get_new_command` function is formatting the output. The expected output of the function seems to include a colon `:` before the column number, but the actual output doesn't include the colon in some cases.

The potential error location is within the `get_new_command` function where the output string is being formatted.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `get_new_command` function is not including the colon `:` before the column number when it should.

Approach to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the colon `:` is included before the column number when formatting the output string.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{} {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                      m.group('file'),
                                      m.group('line'),
                                      m.group('col'),
                                      command.script)
    return editor_call
```

In the corrected code, the `:` is added before the column number to ensure that it is correctly formatted in the output string.
