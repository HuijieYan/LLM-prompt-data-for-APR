Based on the test cases provided, the buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to extract file and line information from error messages and then construct an editor command. However, in the existing code, the function is not processing the error messages correctly and is not constructing the editor command properly.

The potential error location within the function is the `_search` function, as it is not handling the error messages correctly and is not extracting the required file and line information properly. Additionally, the construction of the editor call with the `shells.and_` method is also incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_search` function is not capturing accurate file and line information from the error messages, and the construction of the editor call is incorrect due to the use of `shells.and_` method.

To fix the bug, the `_search` function needs to be modified to accurately capture file and line information from the error messages. Additionally, the construction of the editor call should be done in a more appropriate manner, taking into account the accurate file and line information.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    stderr = command.stderr.split("\n")  # Split the stderr message into lines
    for line in stderr:
        if line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty
            parts = line.split(":")  # Split the line by ':'
            if len(parts) >= 2:
                file_info = parts[0]
                line_num = parts[1]
                editor_call = '{} "{}" +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], file_info, line_num)
                return editor_call  # Return the editor call
    return ''  # Return empty string if no editor call is constructed
```

In the corrected code, the stderr message is split into lines and then each line is processed to extract file and line information. The editor call is constructed using the accurate file and line information. If no editor call can be constructed, an empty string is returned.

This approach ensures that accurate file and line information is extracted from the error messages and the editor call is constructed correctly.
