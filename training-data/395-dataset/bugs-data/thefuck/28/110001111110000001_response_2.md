The error seems to be related to the formatting of the `editor_call` variable in the `get_new_command` function. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the formatting of the editor call with respect to the line and column numbers.

The problem seems to be caused by the incorrect formatting of the `editor_call` string, specifically the `+{line}:{col}` part. The function is not handling the `col` part properly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `col` part is included only when it exists. If `col` exists, it should be appended to the `editor_call` string; otherwise, the `editor_call` string should not include the `col` part.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os 

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
    
    if m.group('col'):
        editor_call += ':{}'.format(m.group('col'))

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

By this correction, the `col` part is added to the `editor_call` only if it exists, thus resolving the bug.
