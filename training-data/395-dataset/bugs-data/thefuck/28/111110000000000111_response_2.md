The potential error in the function is with the usage of `shells.and_` which seems to be a syntax error as it is not a valid method or function.

The bug occurs because the `shells.and_` is not a valid method or function in Python. It seems like the intention here is to concatenate two shell commands, which can be achieved using the `subprocess` module in Python.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `subprocess` module to concatenate the shell commands and return the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import re
import subprocess

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    
    merged_command = f"{editor_call} && {command.script}"
    return merged_command
```
