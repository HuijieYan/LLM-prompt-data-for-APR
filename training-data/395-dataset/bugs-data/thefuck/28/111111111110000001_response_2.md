Error location:
The issue is in the `get_new_command` function where the formatting of the `editor_call` is incorrect.

Reason for the bug:
The formatting of the `editor_call` is incorrect due to which the test cases are failing. The interpolation of `{}` for `editor_call` is causing incorrect formatting.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. The correct formatting should be `{}` in the `editor_call` string.
2. Verify if the logic for constructing the new command is correctly implemented in the `get_new_command` function.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
