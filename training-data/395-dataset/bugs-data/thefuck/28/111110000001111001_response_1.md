The issue with the buggy function is the use of the undefined `os` module for the `EDITOR` environment variable. As a result, the format string in the `editor_call` variable is using `{}` instead of the actual editor command. This can cause a `KeyError` when trying to access the `EDITOR` environment variable. 

To fix this issue, we need to import the `os` module at the beginning of the script, and then use the `os.getenv` function to retrieve the value of the `EDITOR` environment variable. Additionally, we should ensure that the `m` value is not `None` before using the `m.group()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor = os.getenv('EDITOR')
    if m and editor:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(editor, m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        return command.script
```

With these changes, the function should work as expected, preventing any `KeyError` related to the `os.environ['EDITOR']` access. Additionally, by checking the `m` value and the `EDITOR` environment variable, we make the function more robust.
