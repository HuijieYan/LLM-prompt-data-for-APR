This function seems to be taking a command and settings as input and then attempting to create a new command using the provided settings. The error message indicates that the 'editor_call' string is being generated incorrectly, leading to an incorrect comparison in the test case.

The bug seems to be in the 'editor_call' generation, as it is not capturing the value of 'col' from the 'm' group correctly.

The reason for this bug is that the 'col' attribute is not being obtained correctly from the 'm' group, causing the 'editor_call' string to be formatted incorrectly.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the 'col' attribute is obtained correctly from the 'm' group, and then use it to format the 'editor_call' string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                        m.group('file'),
                                        m.group('line'),
                                        m.group('col'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In this corrected code, the 'col' attribute is now properly obtained from the 'm' group and used to format the 'editor_call' string. This should fix the bug and ensure the correct comparison in the test case.
