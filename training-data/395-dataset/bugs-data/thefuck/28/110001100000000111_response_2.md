Potential error location: The _search function is being called with the argument command.stderr, but the _search function actually takes a single argument called stderr.

Reason for the bug: The _search function is not being called correctly, as it is being passed the wrong argument.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to call the _search function with the correct argument, which is the stderr.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import shells  # assuming this module is imported somewhere

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
