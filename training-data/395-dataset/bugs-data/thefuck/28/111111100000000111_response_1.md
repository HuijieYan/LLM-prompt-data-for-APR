Potential error location: In the get_new_command function, the _search function is being called with the command's stderr and stdout, but the _search function doesn't seem to be returning anything.

Reasons for the bug:
The _search function is not implemented properly and is not returning any values. This is causing the m variable to be None, which leads to an AttributeError when trying to call the group method on it.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check the implementation of the _search function and ensure that it is returning the expected result.
2. Add a condition to check if the m variable is not None before trying to access its group method.

Corrected code:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    if m is not None:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         m.group('file'),
                                         m.group('line'))
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        return command.script
```
