The error is occurring due to the incorrect concatenation of the strings inside the `get_new_command` function. It seems that the function is trying to concatenate two strings for the `editor_call` variable using the `os.environ['EDITOR']`. 

The bug is occurring due to incorrect string formatting. The number of format specifiers provided in the format string does not match the number of arguments provided. This is causing the AssertionError in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the correct number of format specifiers should be used to match the number of arguments provided when formatting the string. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))

    return '{} && {}'.format(editor_call, command.script)
```
