The bug occurred due to the incorrect implementation of the conditions for building the `editor_call` variable. The conditions for adding column information were not correctly handled, leading to incorrect comparisons in the test cases.

The bug occurred because the function incorrectly used the `settings.fixcolcmd` string, which includes column information. This caused the incorrect comparison between the expected `editor_call` and the actual values in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements and the string formatting for `editor_call` based on the presence of column information.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    editor = os.environ['EDITOR']
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(editor, m.group('file'), m.group('line'))

    if 'col' in m.groupdict():
        editor_call += ':{col}'

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

By making this adjustment, we properly handle the presence of column information and correctly build the `editor_call` value.

The corrected function will now work as expected and should pass the provided test cases with the adjusted string formatting.
