The buggy function has multiple issues. It is attempting to access `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` directly, but `command` is an instance of the `Command` class and does not have these attributes. Instead, it seems that the `_search` function should be called with the parameters `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`.

Another issue is that the `os.environ['EDITOR']` variable is being used without importing the `os` module.

The function also references `shells.and_`, but the import for `shells` is missing.

Additionally, there is an incorrect string formatting for `editor_call`.

Finally, there are some missing imports for the modules used in the function.

To fix these issues, the following changes can be made:

1. The `_search` function should be called with `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` as parameters.
2. Import the `os` module at the beginning of the file.
3. Import the `shells` module at the beginning of the file.
4. Use the correct string formatting for `editor_call`.
5. Import the necessary modules used in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os
import re
from thefuck.shells import and_

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ.get('EDITOR', 'nano'),
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
