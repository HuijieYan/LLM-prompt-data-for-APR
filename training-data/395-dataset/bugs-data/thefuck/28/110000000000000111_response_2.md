Potential error location: The potential error is in the use of `shells.and_` which is not a standard Python function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the `shells.and_` function is not a standard Python function and therefore is likely causing a syntax error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Replace the use of `shells.and_` with a valid Python function or syntax that achieves the intended result.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return f"{editor_call} && {command.script}"
```
