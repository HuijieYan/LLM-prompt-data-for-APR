The error seems to be related to the formatting of the string in the `get_new_command` function. The expected output in the test is not matching the actual output due to incorrect formatting of the string.

The bug in the function is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the string in the `editor_call` variable. The string formatting for `editor_call` does not match the expected format based on the test case.

To fix the bug, the string formatting in the `editor_call` variable should be modified to match the expected format. Additionally, missing imports for `os` and `shells` are also identified in the code. These should be added to the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os
import shells

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'),
                                     ':' + m.group('col') if m.group('col') else '')
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
