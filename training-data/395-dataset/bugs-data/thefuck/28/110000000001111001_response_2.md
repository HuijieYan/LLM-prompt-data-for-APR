The potential error in the provided function is in the line:
```python
shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

The reason for the bug is that the `shells` module or class is not defined in the given code snippet, and it is being used to concatenate the result of the `editor_call` with `command.script`.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use string concatenation to combine `editor_call` and `command.script` instead of relying on `shells.and_()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return editor_call + ' ' + command.script
```

In this corrected code, the `shells.and_()` method is replaced with simple string concatenation to combine `editor_call` and `command.script`.
