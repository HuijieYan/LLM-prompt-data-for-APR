The error in the buggy code seems to be related to the use of the `group` method on the variable `m`. The error message from the test function indicates that it expects a specific format for the command generated by the `get_new_command` function, but the actual result does not match the expected format due to the usage of the 'group' method.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                 m.group('file'),
                                 m.group('line'))
```

The use of `m.group('file')` and `m.group('line')` in the `editor_call` assignment assumes that `m` is a regular expression match object with named groups 'file' and 'line'. However, the `group` method is not used correctly here, which leads to an unexpected format in the `editor_call` variable.

The correction would involve using the correct regular expression capturing groups and accessing them properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    file_match = re.search(r'(?P<file>\S+):(?P<line>\d+)', m)  # Assuming the file and line format
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], file_match.group('file'), file_match.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In the corrected code, a regular expression search is used to find the file and line, and then the named groups are accessed correctly to form the `editor_call`.
