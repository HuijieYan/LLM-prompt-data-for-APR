The bug in the `get_new_command` function seems to be related to the format string used to construct the `editor_call`. The error messages indicate that the expected value for the `editor_call` is not being generated correctly.

The potential error location appears to be in the way the `editor_call` is being constructed based on the `test` input.

The bug occurs because the format string used for constructing `editor_call` seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the format string for constructing `editor_call` needs to be adjusted to handle the cases where `test[3]` is present or not present.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import os

def get_editor_call(editor, file, line, col=None):
    if col:
        return f'{editor} {file} +{line}:{col}'
    else:
        return f'{editor} {file} +{line}'

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = get_editor_call(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'), m.group('col'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

This corrected function utilizes a separate function `get_editor_call` to handle constructing the `editor_call` based on the presence of the `col` parameter. This ensures that the `editor_call` is constructed correctly based on the input parameters.
