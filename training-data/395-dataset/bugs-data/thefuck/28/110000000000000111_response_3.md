Potential error location: The potential error is in the `shells.and_` function call. It seems that the `shells` module is not imported in the code, so the `and_` function should be replaced with the logical AND operator `and`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `shells` module is not imported, resulting in a NameError when trying to call the `and_` function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Replace the `shells.and_` function call with the logical AND operator `and`.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return editor_call and command.script
```
