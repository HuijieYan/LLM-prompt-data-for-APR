The bug in the `get_new_command` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the editor call. The `get_new_command` function is concatenating the file, line, and column numbers with the editor command using the format string `'{editor} {file} +{line}:{col}'` as provided in the `settings` object. However, in some cases, the column number might be missing, and the format string should be `'{editor} {file} +{line}'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the formatting of the editor call based on the presence of the column number. We can achieve this by checking whether the `col` attribute is present in the regex match object `m` and formatting the editor call accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    if 'col' in m.groupdict():
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{} && {}'.format(
            os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'), m.group('col'), command.script
        )
    else:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{} && {}'.format(
            os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'), command.script
        )

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

By properly formatting the `editor_call` based on the presence of the `col` attribute in the regex match object, we ensure that the editor call is correctly constructed in all cases and the bug is fixed.
