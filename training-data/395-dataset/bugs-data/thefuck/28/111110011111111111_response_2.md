The error occurs due to the incorrect formatting of the editor call based on the test case input. The `fixcolcmd` format is incorrect, resulting in an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual editor call strings.

The problematic function is the `get_new_command` function.

The bug occurs because the `fixcolcmd` option in the `Settings` object is not formatted correctly to include the column number when generating the editor call.

To fix the bug, the `fixcolcmd` in the `Settings` object should be formatted correctly to include the `{col}` placeholder for the column number.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{} && {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                            m.group('file'),
                                            m.group('line'),
                                            m.group('col'))
    return editor_call, command.script
```

In the corrected code, the `editor_call` format includes the `{col}` placeholder for the column number, allowing the correct editor call to be generated based on the `fixcolcmd` setting in the `Settings` object.
