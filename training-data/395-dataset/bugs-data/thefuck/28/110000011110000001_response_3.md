The error in the function `get_new_command` seems to be related to the formatting of the `editor_call` variable. It is failing to correctly format `editor_call` as it should and is leading to AssertionsErrors in the test cases. The error is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the string in the `editor_call` line.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the absence of the `col` field properly. It assumes that `col` will always be present, which is not always the case. This causes the string formatting to break when `col` is not present.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `col` field is not present. We can use an if-else statement to conditionally include the `col` in the `editor_call` based on whether it is present or not.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    if 'col' in m.groupdict():
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                        m.group('file'),
                                        m.group('line'),
                                        m.group('col'))
    else:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         m.group('file'),
                                         m.group('line'))

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle cases where the `col` field is not present, and the test cases should pass without any AssertionErrors.
