The bug occurs in the function `get_new_command`. The bug is caused by a missing attribute `group` for the `m` object.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to access `m.group('file')` and `m.group('line')` without first checking if `m` is not None. It needs to be handled to prevent a AttributeError.

To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that `m` is not None before accessing the groups.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_28/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    if m:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file') if m.group('file') is not None else '', m.group('line') if m.group('line') is not None else '')
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        return command.script
```
