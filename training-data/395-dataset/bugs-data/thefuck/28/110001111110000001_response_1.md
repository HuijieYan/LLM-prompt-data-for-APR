The error in the code is caused by the `get_new_command` function. The function concatenates the `editor_call` variable with the `command.script` using the `shells.and_` method, which seems to be a custom method and not a built-in function. This causes the AssertionError in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to properly concatenate the `editor_call` with the `command.script` using the standard string concatenation in Python.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return '{} && {}'.format(editor_call, command.script)
```

We've replaced the `shells.and_` function with the standard string concatenation. This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
