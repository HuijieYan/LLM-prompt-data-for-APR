The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function does not handle the case where the `col` variable is present. In the test function, the error message indicates that the formatting of `+{line}:{col}` is not being properly handled.

To fix this bug, the `get_new_command` function needs to be modified to handle the `col` variable properly. It should be included in the `editor_call` string if it exists.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    if m.group('col'):
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                           m.group('file'),
                                           m.group('line'),
                                           m.group('col'))
    else:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         m.group('file'),
                                         m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

By including a conditional check for the presence of the `col` variable, the function now handles both cases and formats the `editor_call` string accordingly. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to work as expected.
