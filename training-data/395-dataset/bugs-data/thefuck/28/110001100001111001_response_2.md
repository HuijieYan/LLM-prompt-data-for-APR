The bug in the provided function is caused by the incorrect matching of the file and line information from the stderr of the command. The function is attempting to create an editor call using the matched file and line information, but it does not handle situations where the file and line information are not captured correctly.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the file and line information is retrieved correctly and then construct the editor call accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Parse the file and line information from the matched string
    match_str = m.group(0)  # Assuming the entire match contains the file and line information
    file_line_match = re.search(r'([^:]+):(\d+)', match_str)
    if file_line_match:
        file = file_line_match.group(1)
        line = file_line_match.group(2)
        
        # Construct the editor call using the file and line information
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], file, line)
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        # Handle cases where the file and line information could not be parsed
        return "Unable to parse file and line information for the editor call"
```

In the corrected code, we first ensure that the file and line information is parsed correctly from the matched string. Then we construct the editor call using the parsed file and line information.

This approach ensures that the function handles cases where the file and line information is not captured correctly and provides a more robust way of constructing the editor call.
