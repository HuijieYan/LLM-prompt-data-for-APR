The bug in the given function is due to the incorrect format in the `editor_call` variable construction, and also due to missing importing `os` module. The test cases are failing because the output of the function doesn't match the expected command format.

The bug occurs because the `editor_call` variable is not being constructed properly, and the missing `os` module is causing an error. The `m.group('file')` and `m.group('line')` are not being retrieved correctly from the regex match object `m`.

To fix the bug, the function `get_new_command` should be modified to construct the `editor_call` properly using the `m.group('file')` and `m.group('line')` retrieved from the regular expression match object `m`. Also, the missing `import os` should be added at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file') if m.group('file') else '',
                                     m.group('line') if m.group('line') else '')
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
