Potential error location: 
The error is likely originating from the use of the undeclared 'shells' object in the return statement. It seems that the intended usage here is a shell command concatenation, but 'shells' is not a defined object.

Reason for the bug:
The 'shells' object is not defined anywhere in the code, so attempting to use it as if it were a command concatenation function is causing the error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Use the correct shell command concatenation syntax and remove the reference to the undefined 'shells' object.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = f"{os.environ['EDITOR']} {m.group('file')} +{m.group('line')}"
    return f"{editor_call} && {command.script}"
```
