Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the `get_new_command` function where `command` is being used in relation to `stderr` and `stdout`.

Reasons for the bug: The code is attempting to access `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` without having the `command` parameter being explicitly defined in the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Pass `command` as a parameter to the `get_new_command` function so it can be accessed properly.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
