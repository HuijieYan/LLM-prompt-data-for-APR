The error occurs in the `test_get_new_command_with_settings` function, where the `get_new_command` function is called with the `cmd` and `settings` parameters. The error message indicates that the formatting of the command string and the expected string is not matching, specifically the line and column numbers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_new_command` function, where the construction of the `editor_call` string might be incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `editor_call` string is not formatted correctly to include the line and column numbers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug are:
1. Ensure that the `os` module is imported into the file.
2. Check the format of the `editor_call` string to include the line and column numbers in the correct format.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return editor_call + ' && ' + command.script
```
