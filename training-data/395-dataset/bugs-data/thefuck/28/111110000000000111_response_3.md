The potential error in the function is with the use of `shells.and_` which is not a standard Python function or method. The intention seems to be to concatenate the strings `editor_call` and `command.script`, but this is not the correct way to do it.

The bug occurs because `shells.and_` is not a valid function or method in Python. It is possible that it was intended to concatenate the strings `editor_call` and `command.script` together, but this is not the correct way to do it.

To fix this bug, we can directly concatenate the two strings using the `+` operator.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return editor_call + command.script
```
