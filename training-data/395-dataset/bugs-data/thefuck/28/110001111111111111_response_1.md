The function `get_new_command` seems to be intended to prepare a new command to run in the shell. However, it seems to be failing for test cases that involve setting the editor along with the line and column numbers. This is evident from the error messages generated by the test function.

After analyzing the test cases and the error messages, it appears that the function `get_new_command` is not correctly handling the formatting of the `editor_call` string when `fixcolcmd` is provided in the settings. It should format the command using the `:` separator for the line and column numbers.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely to be incorrect handling of the `fixcolcmd` setting, leading to unexpected behaviors when constructing the `editor_call` string. This is causing the test assertions to fail.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function needs to correctly handle the `fixcolcmd` setting by leveraging the `:` separator for the line and column numbers in the `editor_call` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: There does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    file_path = m.group('file')
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(
        os.environ['EDITOR'], file_path, m.group('line'))

    if 'fixcolcmd' in settings:
        editor_call += ':' + m.group('col')

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
