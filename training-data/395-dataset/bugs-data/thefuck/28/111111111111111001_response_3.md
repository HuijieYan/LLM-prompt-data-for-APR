## Problem Analysis

The error occurs when the `get_new_command` function tries to format the `editor_call` string with the values from the `m.group('file')`, `m.group('line')`, and `m.group('col')` groups. It seems that the `m` object does not always have the `col` group, resulting in an assertion error in the test.

## Reasons for the Bug

The bug occurs because the `m` object is being used to extract the file, line, and column numbers, but it does not always contain a `col` group. This causes the formatting of the `editor_call` string to vary based on the presence of the `col` group, leading to assertion errors in the tests.

## Possible Fix

To fix this bug, the `get_new_command` function should check for the presence of the `col` group in the `m` object before including it in the formatting of the `editor_call` string. If the `col` group is not present, the formatting should omit the `col` component.

## Corrected Code

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr)
    
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(
        os.environ['EDITOR'],
        m.group('file'),
        m.group('line')
    )
    
    if m.group('col'):
        editor_call += ':{}'.format(m.group('col'))
        
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

By adding a conditional check for the presence of the `col` group in the `m` object, the corrected code ensures that the `editor_call` string is formatted correctly based on the available information. This should prevent the assertion errors in the tests and provide a more robust way of handling different cases during string formatting.
