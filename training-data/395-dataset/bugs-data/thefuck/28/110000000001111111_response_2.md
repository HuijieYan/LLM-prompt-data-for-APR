The issue with the provided function is that the `_search` function is not defined, and it's not clear how it should work. Additionally, the `shells.and_` function is called, but it is not a built-in Python function or library, so its purpose is also unclear.

Given this, we need to make assumptions about the behavior of `_search` and `shells.and_` in order to fix the function. Assuming that `_search` is meant to search for a pattern in the input string and extract file name and line number, and `shells.and_` is intended to concatenate commands, we can proceed with fixing the function.

Here's the corrected function `get_new_command`:

```python
import re
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = re.search(r'(\S+):(\d+):', command.stderr) or re.search(r'(\S+):(\d+):', command.stdout)

    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group(1), m.group(2))
    new_command = '{} && {}'.format(editor_call, command.script)
    return new_command
```

In this corrected version:
1. We used the `re.search` function to search for the pattern of file name and line number in the `stderr` and `stdout` of the `command` object.
2. We then used the file name and line number to construct the `editor_call` by formatting the string with the file name and line number found in the regex match.
3. Finally, we concatenated the `editor_call` with the `command.script` using the `&&` operator to create the `new_command`.

Please note that this fix assumes a standard error message format with the file name and line number separated by a colon. If the error message format varies, the regex pattern in the `re.search` calls will need to be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, if the behavior of `_search` and `shells.and_` is different from our assumptions, the fix might need to be adjusted further.
