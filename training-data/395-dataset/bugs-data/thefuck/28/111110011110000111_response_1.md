The bug in the `get_new_command` function is causing an incorrect assertion result in the test function. The error occurs because the `editor_call` string is not correctly formatted. The format used for `{}` is expected to be replaced with the available arguments. However, the incorrect use of `{}` is causing incorrect format and assertion failures.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the `{}` placeholders in the `editor_call` string are replaced with the correct arguments in the desired positions.
2. The correct arguments should be `m.group('file')`, `m.group('line')`, `m.group('col')` in their respective positions within the `editor_call` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))

    if 'col' in m.groupdict():
        editor_call += ':' + m.group('col')

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
