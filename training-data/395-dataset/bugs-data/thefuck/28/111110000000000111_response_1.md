Potential Error:
The 'os' module is used without being imported in the code, so the function will throw an error due to the missing import.

Reason for the Bug:
The 'os' module is not imported in the code, so when trying to access the environmental variable 'EDITOR', it will result in an error.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Import the 'os' module at the beginning of the script to access the environmental variable 'EDITOR'.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
