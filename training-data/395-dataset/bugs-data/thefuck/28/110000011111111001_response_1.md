The bug in the `get_new_command` function seems to occur due to the incorrect formatting of the `editor_call` on different test cases. The expected format of the `editor_call` is not matching with the actual value in the test cases, which is causing the assertion errors in the test function.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by an incorrect format for the `editor_call`. The `settings` are configured to include the file, line, and column in the format string; however, the format of the `editor_call` is expected to include these values but is not matching.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `editor_call` should be formatted correctly with the expected values from the settings (file, line, and column).

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    editor_cmd_format = settings.fixcolcmd
    if not m.group('col'):
        editor_cmd_format = settings.fixlinecmd

    editor_call = editor_cmd_format.format(editor=os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                           file=m.group('file'),
                                           line=m.group('line'),
                                           col=m.group('col') if m.group('col') else '')

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In the corrected code, the `editor_call` is formatted based on the `fixcolcmd` or `fixlinecmd` from the settings, depending on the existence of the column in the match group. This ensures that the `editor_call` is formatted correctly based on the settings.

Using this corrected code should resolve the issue and ensure that the test cases pass without the assertion errors.
