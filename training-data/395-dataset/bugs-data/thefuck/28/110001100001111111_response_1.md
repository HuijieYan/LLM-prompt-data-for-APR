It seems that the `_search` function is used to extract file and line information from the error message in the stderr. The function `get_new_command` then uses this information to generate an `editor_call` string, combining it with the EDITOR environment variable and other details from the error message.

The bug occurs because the `_search` function returns a `re.Match` object, but the `group()` method is not being used to extract the information needed for the `editor_call` string.

To fix the bug, we need to extract the necessary information from the `re.Match` object and use it to construct the `editor_call` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code to extract file and line information using regex ...
    return match_object  # assume this is the re.Match object

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    if m:
        file = m.group('file')
        line = m.group('line')
        
        # Construct the editor call using the extracted file and line information
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], file, line)
        
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        # Handle case where no match is found
        return command.script
```

In the corrected code, we extract the file and line information from the `re.Match` object `m` and use it to construct the `editor_call` string. This should fix the bug and generate the correct `editor_call` string based on the error message.
