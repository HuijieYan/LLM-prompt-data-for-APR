The error in the function `get_new_command` is that the format string for `editor_call` expects `{col}` in the formatting, but in some cases, it is missing. This results in an AssertionError when comparing with the expected output in the tests.

The bug occurs because the format string for `editor_call` is not consistent with the actual values of `{col}` provided. In some cases, the `col` value is missing from the format string, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the format string for `editor_call` includes `{col}` in all cases where it is expected.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    if 'col' in m.groupdict():
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'), m.group('col'))
    else:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `col` group is in `m.groupdict()` and then include it in the `editor_call` format string accordingly. This ensures consistency and resolves the bug.
