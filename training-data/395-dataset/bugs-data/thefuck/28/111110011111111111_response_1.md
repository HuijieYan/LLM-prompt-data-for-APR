The buggy function `get_new_command` seems to have an issue with the construction of the `editor_call` variable. The `editor_call` is generated using the `os.environ['EDITOR']` and other parameters. However, the issue arises when trying to generate the correct call with the line and column. The mismatch occurs because the condition `if test[3]:` is not handling the else case properly, resulting in the generated call having extra data that doesn't fit the correct format.

The cause of this bug is likely an oversight in handling the condition for the existence of column data. The if-else statement for handling `test[3]` is likely not properly formatting the `editor_call` variable.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to correctly format the `editor_call` variable based on the presence of column data. This can be achieved by modifying the if-else condition to construct the `editor_call` variable based on the existence of column data.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    if m:
        if m.group('col'):
            editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{} && {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                                     m.group('file'),
                                                     m.group('line'),
                                                     m.group('col'),
                                                     command.script)
        else:
            editor_call = '{} {} +{} && {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                                  m.group('file'),
                                                  m.group('line'),
                                                  command.script)
    else:
        editor_call = '{} +{} && {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], command.script)

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In this corrected function, the condition for the existence of column data has been properly handled to format the `editor_call` variable. The `if-else` condition ensures that the `editor_call` is constructed appropriately based on the presence or absence of column data in the input.

This correction should resolve the bug and produce the expected output for the test cases.
