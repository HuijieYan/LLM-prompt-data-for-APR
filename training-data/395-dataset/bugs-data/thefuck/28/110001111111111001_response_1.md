The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the `editor_call` string. The code is incorrectly formatting the string when there is a `{col}` component in the `fixcolcmd` setting.

The bug occurs because the `fixcolcmd` setting is not handled correctly when formatting the `editor_call` string. In cases where the `fixcolcmd` setting contains the `{col}` component, the `editor_call` should be formatted using the `{col}` component. However, the code currently uses the `{line}` and `{col}` components together for the `editor_call` string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for formatting the `editor_call` string based on the presence of the `{col}` component in the `fixcolcmd` setting.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: There does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    if '{col}' in settings.fixcolcmd:
        editor_call = '{}:{} && {}'.format(editor_call, m.group('col'), command.script)
    else:
        editor_call = '{} && {}'.format(editor_call, command.script)

    return editor_call
```

This corrected code properly handles the formatting of the `editor_call` string based on the presence or absence of the `{col}` component in the `fixcolcmd` setting.
