Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the `shells.and_` function, which is not a standard function in Python. It looks like the intention was to concatenate the `editor_call` and `command.script` strings, but this is not the correct way to do so.

Reason for the Bug: The `shells.and_` function is not a built-in function in Python, so it is causing a NameError when trying to execute the code.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `+` operator to concatenate the `editor_call` and `command.script` strings.
2. Import the appropriate module or function that contains the `and_` function and use it properly.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return editor_call + " " + command.script
```
