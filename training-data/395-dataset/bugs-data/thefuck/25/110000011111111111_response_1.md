The buggy function, get_new_command, is designed to replace 'mkdir' with 'mkdir -p' in the given command. The issue arises from the use of regex pattern '^mkdir (.*)' in the re.sub function. This pattern is only applicable to commands that start with 'mkdir', but it does not handle cases where the command is different, such as 'hdfs dfs -mkdir' or './bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir'.

To fix the issue, the regex pattern should be updated to handle all variations of the mkdir command. Additionally, the function should check if the command starts with 'mkdir' before applying the substitution.

The fixed function should look like this:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir'):
        return re.sub(r'^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
    else:
        return command.script
```

With this corrected function, the regex pattern will only be applied to commands that start with 'mkdir', ensuring that 'mkdir -p' is added only when necessary. This should resolve the issues reported in the test cases.
