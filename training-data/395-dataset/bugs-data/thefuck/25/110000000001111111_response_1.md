The error in the provided function is due to the use of the `@sudo_support` decorator, which is not defined in the code. This decorator is causing the function to not work as expected.

To fix this issue, you can remove the `@sudo_support` decorator from the function. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
