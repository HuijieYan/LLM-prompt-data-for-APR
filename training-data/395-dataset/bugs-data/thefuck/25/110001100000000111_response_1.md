The potential error in the given function is the use of the `sudo_support` decorator without its implementation. This indicates that the function is meant to support sudo (superuser) permissions, but it is not implemented within the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `sudo_support` decorator is being used, but its actual implementation is missing. This could lead to unexpected behavior when using the function.

To fix the bug, the `sudo_support` decorator needs to be properly implemented within the function, or it needs to be removed if not required. Additionally, the function should also import the necessary modules such as `re` to support the use of regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected function
def sudo_support(func):
    # implementation for sudo support goes here
    pass

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
