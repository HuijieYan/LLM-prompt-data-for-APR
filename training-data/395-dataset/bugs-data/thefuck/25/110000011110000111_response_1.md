The potential error location is in the `get_new_command` function. The bug in the function is in the `re.sub` function. The regular expression used in the `re.sub` function does not capture the entire `command.script` and replace it with the correct format. This is why the tests are failing.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression used in the `re.sub` function is not capturing the entire string, and the replacement is not being done correctly.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the regular expression to capture the entire `command.script` and replace it with the correct format using the captured groups. Another approach is to use a conditional statement to check if the command starts with 'mkdir' and then replace it with 'mkdir -p' instead of using regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir'):
        return command.script.replace('mkdir', 'mkdir -p', 1)  # Replace only the first occurrence
    else:
        return command.script
```
