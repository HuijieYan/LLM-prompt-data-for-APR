The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function, where it is trying to modify the command by adding the `-p` option to the `mkdir` command. The current implementation simply replaces the `mkdir` with `mkdir -p` using regular expressions, but it fails to recognize the context in which the `mkdir` command is used. As a result, it incorrectly adds the `-p` option to commands where it should not.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to capture the context in which the `mkdir` command is used. This can be achieved by checking if the command starts with `hdfs dfs -mkdir` and only then adding the `-p` option.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir '):
        return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
    elif command.script.startswith('hdfs dfs -mkdir '):
        return re.sub('^hdfs dfs -mkdir (.*)', 'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
    else:
        return command.script
```

With this correction, the `get_new_command` function checks the context in which the command is used and only adds the `-p` option when appropriate. This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct command is returned.
