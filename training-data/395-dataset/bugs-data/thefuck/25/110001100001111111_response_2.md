The buggy function is intended to replace `mkdir` with `mkdir -p` in the command script. However, the function is not handling the scenario where the `mkdir` command is part of a larger command, such as `hdfs dfs -mkdir` or `./bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir`.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to use a more flexible regular expression that can handle cases where `mkdir` is part of a larger command. The modified function needs to check for the presence of `mkdir` as a whole command, not as a substring of a larger command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

# this is the fixed function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^| )mkdir( |$)', r'\1mkdir -p\2', command.script)
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression `(^| )mkdir( |$)` checks for the presence of `mkdir` as a whole command, with optional spaces before and after. It then replaces it with `mkdir -p`, maintaining any leading or trailing spaces. This allows the function to handle cases where `mkdir` is part of a larger command.
