The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it attempts to use `command.script` directly as if it were a string. However, `command` is actually an instance of the `Command` class, and `script` is an attribute of that class. This causes the `re.sub` function to fail, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to access the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter. Additionally, the regular expression used in `re.sub` needs to be updated to ensure that it only matches the beginning of the command. 

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^(mkdir\s+)(.*)', r'\1-p \2', command.script)
```

In this corrected code:
- We access the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter using `command.script`.
- We update the regular expression to use `\1` and `\2` to refer to the capturing groups in the regex pattern.

This fix will ensure that the `get_new_command` function handles input from the `Command` class correctly and returns the expected output.
