The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to replace the pattern `^mkdir (.*)` with `mkdir -p \\1` in the `command.script`. However, it seems that the function is not handling the cases where `mkdir` is preceded by another command or path. The regular expression used in the `re.sub` function should be modified to handle such cases.

The incorrect function is only handling one specific case (`mkdir` at the beginning of the command) and not the general case (any command with `mkdir`). The `re.sub` function simply replaces the matched pattern with `mkdir -p \\1`, which is not suitable for all cases.

To fix this bug, the regular expression pattern should be modified to capture any combination of characters before `mkdir`, followed by a space, and then capture the directory path. This way, the regular expression will correctly identify the `mkdir` command regardless of its position within the input string.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(\s*)mkdir (.*)', r'\1mkdir -p \2', command.script)
```

In the corrected function, the regular expression `(\s*)mkdir (.*)` will capture any leading spaces, the `mkdir` command, and the directory path. Then, in the replacement string, `\1` and `\2` are used to preserve the leading spaces and the directory path while adding the `-p` option to the `mkdir` command.

This approach will ensure that the function handles all cases where `mkdir` is part of a command string, not just at the beginning.
