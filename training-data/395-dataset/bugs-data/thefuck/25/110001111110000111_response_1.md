The buggy function get_new_command is supposed to take a command and return a new command with 'mkdir -p' instead of 'mkdir'. However, the code doesn't seem to be functioning as expected, as evidenced by the error messages from the test functions.

The problem lies in the regular expression used in the re.sub function. The regular expression '^mkdir (.*)' is only matching the command 'mkdir' with a space followed by anything, which does not cover cases where 'mkdir' is not at the start of the string, or where there are additional arguments before the directory path.

To fix this issue, the regular expression should be modified to capture the entire command with its optional arguments.

The corrected code for the function get_new_command is:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir\b', 'mkdir -p', command.script)
```
