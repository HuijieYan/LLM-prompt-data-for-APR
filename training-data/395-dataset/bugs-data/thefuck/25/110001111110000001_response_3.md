The function `get_new_command` is intended to take a command as input and return a modified version of that command with the `-p` option added to `mkdir` commands. The bug in the function is likely in the regular expression replacement using `re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)`. The problem is that the regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` only matches the `mkdir` command when it is at the beginning of the input, which is not the case in the test command inputs.

To fix this bug, the regular expression pattern should be modified to be more flexible and match the `mkdir` command anywhere in the input. Additionally, the `re` module needs to be imported in order to use the `re.sub` function.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import re

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```

With this change, the regular expression will correctly match the `mkdir` command, wherever it appears in the input command, and add the `-p` option accordingly.
