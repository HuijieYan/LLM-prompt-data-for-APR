The problem with the provided function is that it is trying to use re.sub() to replace the start of the command string with 'mkdir -p'. This approach is incorrect because re.sub() replaces patterns within strings, not the actual command. Additionally, the function is decorated with @sudo_support, but we don't have the definition of this decorator in the code snippet.

To fix this function, we need to directly modify the 'command.script' by adding '-p' to the 'mkdir' command if it exists at the start of the script.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir '):
        command.script = 'mkdir -p ' + command.script[6:]
    return command
```

In this corrected code, we directly modify the 'script' attribute of the command by adding '-p' to the 'mkdir' command if it exists at the start of the script. This approach properly handles the modification of the command script.
