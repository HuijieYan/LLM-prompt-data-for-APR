The error seems to be occurring because the regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` is not matching the command 'hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz', as it does not begin with 'mkdir'. As a result, no substitution is performed, and the original command is returned instead of the modified command.

To fix the bug, the regular expression needs to be modified to match the 'mkdir' command with or without preceding characters.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^| )mkdir +(.*)', r'\1mkdir -p \2', command.script)
```

By using the modified regular expression `(^| )mkdir +(.*)`, we match the 'mkdir' command with or without preceding characters and then perform the substitution to add the '-p' option.

After making the above changes, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
