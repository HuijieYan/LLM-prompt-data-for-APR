The error is likely due to the use of the `re.sub` function in the `get_new_command` method, which is attempting to replace instances of `^mkdir (.*)` with `mkdir -p \\1`. This pattern is meant to replace the "mkdir" command at the beginning of a string with "mkdir -p". However, the bug occurs because the function is incorrectly applying this pattern to the entire string, even if "mkdir" is not at the beginning.

To fix this bug, the `re.sub` function should be modified to correctly handle cases where "mkdir" is not at the beginning of the string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^| )mkdir ', r'\1mkdir -p ', command.script)
```
