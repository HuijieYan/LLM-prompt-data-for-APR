The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is not properly handling the script passed to it. The function is attempting to use `command.script`, which is not a valid attribute for the `Command` object. Instead, the `script` attribute should be accessed directly from the `command` object.

To fix this bug, the `script` attribute of the `command` object should be used directly in the `get_new_command` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
