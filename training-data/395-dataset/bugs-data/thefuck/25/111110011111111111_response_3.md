The bug is in the `get_new_command` function. The function is using the `re.sub` method to substitute `'mkdir (.*)'` with `'mkdir -p \\1'` in the command script. However, this approach will not work as intended because the `re.sub` method expects a regular expression pattern, and the script is a string.

The buggy function is not able to correctly handle the different formats of the `command.script` input. In the test cases, the expected new command is not matching the actual new command returned by the buggy function due to the incorrect application of the `re.sub` method.

To fix the bug, the `re.sub` method should be invoked with correct regular expression as the first argument, and the replacement string as the second argument.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```

By using `r` before the strings, we are making sure that the backslashes are treated as literal backslashes in the replacement string. Additionally, the correct regular expression pattern is also utilized to substitute the command script.
