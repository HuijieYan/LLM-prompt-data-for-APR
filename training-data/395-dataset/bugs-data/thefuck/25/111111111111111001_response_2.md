The buggy function is failing to correctly modify the 'mkdir' command to include the '-p' option. The reason for the bug is that the function does not correctly handle cases where the 'mkdir' command is part of a larger command, for example, 'hdfs dfs -mkdir'. The function simply appends the '-p' option without considering this context.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly identify and modify the 'mkdir' command regardless of its position in a larger command string.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('(^|\\s)mkdir ([^ ]+)', '\\1mkdir -p \\2', command.script)
```

The updated function uses the regular expression to identify the 'mkdir' command and insert the '-p' option while preserving the rest of the command string. This corrected code should resolve the bug and produce the expected results for the test cases provided.
