The potential error in the provided function is that it is attempting to use a decorator `@sudo_support` which is not defined in the code snippet.

The reason behind the bug is that the decorator `@sudo_support` is missing or it does not exist in the code.

To fix the bug, we can remove the undefined decorator `@sudo_support` from the code. Additionally, we need to import the `re` module in order to use the `re.sub` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
