The issue lies with the use of the `@sudo_support` decorator in the `get_new_command` function. This decorator is not defined and is likely the cause of the error.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `@sudo_support` decorator and import the necessary modules such as `re` at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
