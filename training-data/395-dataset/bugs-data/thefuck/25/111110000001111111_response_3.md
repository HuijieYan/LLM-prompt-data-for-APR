The potential error in the given function is the use of the `@sudo_support` decorator, which is not defined in the provided code. This may lead to a NameError when the function is called.

To fix the bug, the decorator `@sudo_support` needs to be defined or removed from the function.

Assuming that the `@sudo_support` decorator is not necessary, the corrected function without the decorator is as follows:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
