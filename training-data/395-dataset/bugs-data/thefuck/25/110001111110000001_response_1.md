The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to replace instances of `mkdir` with `mkdir -p` in a given command. The function uses the `re.sub` method to perform this replacement, but it is not properly handling the case where the command may have additional arguments.

The error message from the test function shows that the function is not correctly replacing the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p`, resulting in the failure of the test cases.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `re.sub` method, which is not accounting for the presence of additional arguments after the `mkdir` command.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of `re.sub` does not capture the entire command with its arguments.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle commands with additional arguments. This can be achieved by using a more specific regular expression to match the `mkdir` command and its arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(?<=^mkdir )(.*)', '-p \\1', command.script)
```

With this corrected implementation, the regular expression uses a positive lookbehind `(?<=^mkdir )` to specifically match the `mkdir` command at the beginning of the string, followed by `(.*)` to capture the entire command with its arguments. This ensures that the replacement is only applied to the `mkdir` command and its arguments. The test cases should now pass without any errors.
