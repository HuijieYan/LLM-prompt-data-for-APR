The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the `re.sub` method used to replace the matched pattern with a new string. Since this function is decorated with `@sudo_support`, it seems that it is attempting to add support for running commands with sudo permissions.

The bug here is that the `re.sub` method is incorrectly replacing the matched pattern with the new string. The original code is including the original command as a script attribute of the input `command` object and then using that in the `re.sub` method. However, the `re.sub` function will not match the command, as it does not include a `mkdir` at the start. It only matches the part after `mkdir`.

To fix this bug, the `re.sub` method needs to be slightly modified to replace only the part after 'mkdir', and not the 'mkdir' command itself.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(?<=mkdir )(.*)', r'-p \1', command.script)
```
