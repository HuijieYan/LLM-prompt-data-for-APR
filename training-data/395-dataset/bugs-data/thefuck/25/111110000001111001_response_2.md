Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the re.sub function, where the regular expression is not matching the command.script as expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The regular expression '^mkdir (.*)' is looking for the exact string 'mkdir' followed by a space, and then capturing everything after that. This fails for cases where the command starts with './bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir' or 'hdfs dfs -mkdir' because they do not match the pattern '^mkdir (.*)'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can update the regular expression pattern to match the command.script string more flexibly, allowing for variations in the command format.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^(.*mkdir .*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
