Potential error location: The use of @sudo_support decorator seems to be causing the issue.

Reason for the bug: The @sudo_support decorator is not a standard Python decorator and it's not clear what it does. Additionally, the re.sub function is used incorrectly.

Possible approach to fix the bug: Remove the @sudo_support decorator and use re.sub correctly to replace the 'mkdir' command with 'mkdir -p'.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```
