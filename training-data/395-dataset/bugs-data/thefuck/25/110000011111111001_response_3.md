The bug in the provided code is related to the wrong use of the `re.sub` function to replace the `mkdir` command with the `mkdir -p` command. The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a `Command` object and modify the `command.script` attribute by replacing `mkdir` with `mkdir -p` using the `re.sub` function, but it is incorrectly implemented.

The error messages from the test functions clearly indicate that the `get_new_command` function is not replacing the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p` as expected. Instead, it simply appends `-p` to the `mkdir` command, resulting in incorrect new commands.

The reason for the bug is that the regular expression used with `re.sub` function, `^mkdir (.*)`, is not correct for the intended replacement. It should only match if the command starts with `mkdir`, but instead, it matches any occurrence of `mkdir`.

To fix the bug, the regular expression should be modified and the `re.sub` function should be used correctly to substitute only the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^| )mkdir ', r'\1mkdir -p ', command.script)
```

With this correction, the regular expression `(^| )mkdir ` matches the beginning of the string or a space followed by `mkdir`, ensuring that only standalone instances of `mkdir` are replaced with `mkdir -p`.
