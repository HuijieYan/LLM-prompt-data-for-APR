The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to replace the command "mkdir" with "mkdir -p". However, it is applying the replacement to the entire command, including the "hdfs" part, which is not desired. This is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the regular expression to only match and replace "mkdir" at the beginning of the command.

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^hdfs dfs -)?mkdir (.*)', r'\1mkdir -p \2', command.script)
```

Explanation:
- The regular expression now uses `(^hdfs dfs -)?` to match an optional "hdfs dfs -" at the beginning of the command. This allows the function to handle the case with "hdfs dfs -mkdir" correctly.
- The replacement pattern uses `\1` to retain "hdfs dfs -" if it's present and replaces only "mkdir" with "mkdir -p".

With this modification, the function should correctly transform the commands as per the provided test cases.
