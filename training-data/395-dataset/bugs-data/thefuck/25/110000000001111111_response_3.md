The buggy function `get_new_command` is attempting to replace the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p` in the input `command.script`. The bug lies in the usage of `sudo_support` decorator, which is undefined in the code provided.

The bug occurs because the `@sudo_support` decorator is not defined or implemented in the code. This causes the function to raise a `NameError` when attempting to run.

To fix the bug:
1. Either define the `@sudo_support` decorator if it is not provided in the code shared, or remove the decorator if it is not necessary for the function.
2. Use the `re.sub` to replace the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p` in the `command.script` using a regular expression.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return Command(script=re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script), stdout='', stderr='')
```
