The buggy function is attempting to replace the command 'mkdir' with 'mkdir -p' using regular expression, but it is not handling the 'hdfs dfs' prefix correctly.

The bug occurs because the buggy function is using a regex pattern that specifically matches 'mkdir' at the beginning of the string, which doesn't account for other prefixes like 'hdfs dfs'. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the regex pattern to handle any prefix before the 'mkdir' command.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^hdfs dfs -)?mkdir (.*)', r'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p \2', command.script)
```

In this corrected code, the regex pattern has been modified to handle any prefix before 'mkdir', and the substitution includes the prefix 'hdfs dfs' if it exists. This should now work for all input cases including the ones provided.
