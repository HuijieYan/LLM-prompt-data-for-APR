The potential error in the provided function is that the function is missing the import statement for the 're' module which is being used in the function.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the 're' module is not imported in the function, so the re.sub function is not recognized by the interpreter.

To fix this bug, we need to import the 're' module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

import re  # Add the import statement for re module

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
