Potential error location:
The error is likely in the use of the `sudo_support` decorator, which was included when it shouldn't have been.

Reasons for the bug:
The `sudo_support` decorator is likely causing issues because it is not a standard Python decorator and is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the `@sudo_support` decorator as it is not necessary for the functionality of the `get_new_command` function.
2. Check if the `re` module is imported properly to use the `re.sub` method.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```
