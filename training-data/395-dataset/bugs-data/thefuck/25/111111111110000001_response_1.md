The buggy function is `get_new_command`. The issue in the function lies in the use of the `sudo_support` decorator and the way the `get_new_command` function attempts to modify the input command by adding the `-p` flag to the `mkdir` command. 

The `sudo_support` decorator is not provided in the code snippet, so we cannot determine its exact functionality. However, it seems that the issue arises from the regular expression substitution used in the `re.sub` function. It fails to properly handle commands that have paths separated by spaces, such as `hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz`.

To fix this, we need to update the regular expression to capture commands with paths separated by spaces. We can modify the regular expression pattern to capture any characters following `mkdir` and replace it with `mkdir -p` followed by the captured characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir\s+(.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```

With the updated regular expression pattern, the function should now be able to properly handle commands with spaces in the paths, as shown in the test cases.
