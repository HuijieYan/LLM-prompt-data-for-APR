Potential error location: The function is using the re.sub() method, but it is missing the import statement for the re module.

Reason behind the bug: Since the re module is not imported, the re.sub() method is not recognized and is resulting in a NameError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the re module at the beginning of the file.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

import re

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
