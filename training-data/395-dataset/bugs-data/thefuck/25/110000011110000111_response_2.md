The error seems to be related to the use of the `re.sub` function in the `get_new_command` method. The method is using a regular expression to match the pattern "mkdir (.*)" and replace it with "mkdir -p \\1". The issue is that the regular expression is not matching the full command, which is causing the replacement to be incorrect.

The buggy function is not correctly matching the command patterns and applying the replacement. It is failing to detect the presence of "hdfs dfs" in the command and as a result is not adding "-p" appropriately.

To fix the issue, the regular expression pattern needs to be adjusted to correctly match the command pattern and then apply the replacement.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` method:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^(hdfs\sdfs\s-mkdir\s)|^mkdir\s', r'\1mkdir -p ', command.script)
```

With this corrected code, the regular expression matches both "hdfs dfs -mkdir" and "mkdir" commands and properly adds "-p" before the directories. This should address the issue with the test cases failing and the incorrect output.
