Potential error location: The use of @sudo_support decorator is not defined and could be causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The @sudo_support decorator is not defined in the code and is likely causing the function to fail.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the @sudo_support decorator and define it if necessary, or refactor the function to work without it.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
