Potential error location: The function is trying to use the variable `command.script` without first importing the necessary modules.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is trying to use the `re` module to substitute a string, but the `re` module has not been imported.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the `re` module at the beginning of the file to use its functions within the `get_new_command` function.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
