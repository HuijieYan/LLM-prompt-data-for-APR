The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function does not handle cases where `mkdir` command may include file paths with additional commands like `hdfs dfs`. It only replaces `mkdir` with `mkdir -p`. This results in the wrong output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle cases where `hdfs dfs` command is used for creating directories. We will change the function so that it identifies whether the command includes `hdfs dfs` and then appends `-p` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if 'hdfs dfs -mkdir' in command.script:
        return re.sub('hdfs dfs -mkdir (.*)', 'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
    else:
        return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```

With this corrected code, the function can properly handle both `mkdir` and `hdfs dfs -mkdir` commands and provide the appropriate new command.
