The buggy function is attempting to modify the 'mkdir' command to include the '-p' flag using regular expressions, but it has some issues. 

The bug occurs because the function is trying to access the 'script' attribute of the 'command' object, but the 'command' object does not have a 'script' attribute. Instead, the 'command.script' should be accessed directly for the input command. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command)
```
