The buggy function is using a decorator `@sudo_support` which suggests that it is expecting to have some sudo support added to the `get_new_command` function. However, the code inside the function does not reflect any sudo-related functionality.

The function is using `re.sub` to substitute the command script, but it is not handling different types of commands appropriately. The function assumes that the input command always starts with `mkdir` and tries to add the `-p` option to it. This will cause issues when the input command is different.

To fix this, we need to handle different types of commands and apply the necessary modifications based on the type of command provided.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir '):
        return command.script.replace('mkdir ', 'mkdir -p ')
    elif command.script.startswith('hdfs dfs -mkdir '):
        return command.script.replace('hdfs dfs -mkdir ', 'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p ')
    else:
        return command.script  # return unchanged if the command type is not handled
```

This corrected function checks the type of command and applies the modification based on the type. If the command starts with `'mkdir '`, it adds `-p` option. If the command starts with `'hdfs dfs -mkdir '`, it also adds the `-p` option. If the command type is not handled, it returns the command.script unchanged.
