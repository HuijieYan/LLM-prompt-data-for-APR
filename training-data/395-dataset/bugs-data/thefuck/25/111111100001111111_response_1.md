The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to prefix the `mkdir` command with `-p` if not already present. The issue with the function is that it is not importing the necessary modules such as `re` and the `sudo_support` decorator. Additionally, the `command` object is not defined.

To fix the function, the `re` module must be imported to use the `re.sub` method, and the `sudo_support` decorator needs to be imported. Furthermore, the correct function signature should include the `command` argument.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
from thefuck.utils import sudo_support

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```

In this corrected code, we imported the necessary modules, included the correct function signature with the `command` argument, and fixed the `re.sub` replacement string to use raw string (r'mkdir -p \1') for proper backreference.
