Potential error location: 
The issue is with the regular expression that is being used in the `re.sub()` method. The regular expression is not correctly capturing the command and replacing it with the `-p` flag.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` is trying to match the command with "mkdir" followed by a space and then any characters that come after it. However, this expression does not take into account the possibility of additional parameters or flags being present after the directory path.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a regular expression pattern that specifically matches the command and the directory path without considering additional parameters or flags.
2. Use a regular expression pattern that captures the entire command and then appends the `-p` flag to it.
3. Handle the addition of the `-p` flag manually by checking if the command starts with "mkdir", and if it does, append the `-p` flag to the command.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir '):
        return command.script.replace('mkdir ', 'mkdir -p ')
    else:
        return command.script
```
