The issue in the `get_new_command` function is with the use of the `re.sub` method. It is not handling commands with multiple segments where the `mkdir` command is part of a larger command string. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the regular expression pattern to consider any command that starts with "mkdir" and not just ones with a single segment.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(hdfs dfs -)?mkdir (.*)', r'\1mkdir -p \2', command.script)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle commands like "hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz" or "./bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz" and convert them to "hdfs dfs -mkdir -p foo/bar/baz" and "./bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir -p foo/bar/baz" respectively.
