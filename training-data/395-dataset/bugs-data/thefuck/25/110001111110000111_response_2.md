The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function is replacing 'mkdir' with 'mkdir -p' using regular expressions, but it is not handling cases where 'mkdir' is part of a larger command with arguments.

The bug occurs because the regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` only matches if the command starts with 'mkdir', but does not match if there is a path or additional arguments after 'mkdir'.

To fix the bug, the regular expression should be modified to handle cases where the 'mkdir' command is part of a larger command with arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# corrected function to fix the bug
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(mkdir\s+)(.*)', r'\1-p \2', command.script)
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression `(mkdir\s+)(.*)` is used to match the 'mkdir' command followed by one or more spaces and then capture the rest of the command. This will correctly handle cases where 'mkdir' is part of a larger command with arguments.
