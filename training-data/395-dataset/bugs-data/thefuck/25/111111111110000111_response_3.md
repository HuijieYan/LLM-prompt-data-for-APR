The provided test case is designed to check whether the `get_new_command` function correctly converts `mkdir` commands to `mkdir -p` commands. The error message indicates that the function is not working as expected in the given scenarios.

The bug is likely in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the regular expression substitution. The bug occurs because the regular expression pattern used to match the `mkdir` command is not correctly matching commands that include additional arguments.

To fix the bug, the regular expression should be modified to match the entire command, including any additional arguments. Additionally, the substitution should include the entire matched command, including any additional arguments, and append the `-p` flag.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^(mkdir .*?)(?=\s|$)', r'\1 -p', command.script)
```

With this correction, the function will properly match the entire `mkdir` command, including any additional arguments, and replace it with the same command followed by the `-p` flag. This should resolve the issue and make the test cases pass.
