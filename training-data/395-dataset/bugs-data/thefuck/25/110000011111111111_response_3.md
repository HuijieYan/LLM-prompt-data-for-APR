The bug is likely in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the regular expression used to substitute the 'mkdir' command with 'mkdir -p'. The function seems to assume that the input command always starts with 'mkdir', which is not true for all cases.

The reason for the bug is that the regular expression '^mkdir (.*)' only matches commands that start with 'mkdir'. Therefore, it does not match commands like 'hdfs dfs -mkdir' or './bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expression to match any command that contains 'mkdir' followed by a space at the start.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^| )mkdir ', r'\1mkdir -p ', command.script)
```

This updated function uses the regular expression `(r'(^| )mkdir ', r'\1mkdir -p ', command.script)` to match any occurrence of 'mkdir' followed by a space at the start of the command, and then replace it with 'mkdir -p'. This handles all cases where the 'mkdir' command might occur in the input.
