The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]`. The issue is that the regular expression is not matching any value in the `command.output`, resulting in an empty list, and attempting to access the first element of an empty list throws the IndexError.

The reason for the bug is that the regular expression pattern is not matching the expected text in the `command.output`. 

To fix this bug, the regular expression pattern needs to be adjusted to correctly match the expected text in the `command.output`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)

        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return "No matching command found in the output"
```
