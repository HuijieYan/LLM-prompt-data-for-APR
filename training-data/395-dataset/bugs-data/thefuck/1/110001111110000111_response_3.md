The error is occurring due to the use of regular expressions to find matches in the `command.output` string within the `get_new_command` function. The issue is related to the usage of `re.findall` without validating if there is a match before accessing the first element of the result.

To fix this issue, we need to check if there is a match before accessing the first element of the result. Additionally, we should handle cases where there might not be a match and raise an error or have a default behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    
    if not broken_cmd_match or not new_cmd_match:
        raise ValueError("No matches found in command output")
    
    broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
    new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
