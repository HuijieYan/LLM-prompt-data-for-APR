Potential error location: 
The potential error is likely in the use of the `re` module without importing it in the function. The `re.findall()` function is used without importing the `re` module.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `re` module is not imported in the function, so using `re.findall()` will result in a "NameError" because the `re` module is not recognized.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
Import the `re` module at the beginning of the file or within the function to resolve the "NameError". Also, add a check to ensure that the regex pattern matches before attempting to access the element at index 0 of the result list to avoid potential "IndexError".

Corrected code:
```python
import re  # Import the re module

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    # Check if the regex pattern matches
    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return "No match found"  # Or handle the case where no match is found
```
