The error in the provided code is due to the use of regular expressions in the `get_new_command` function. The `re.findall` function returns an empty list because the pattern does not match with the `command.output`. This leads to an Index error when trying to access the first element of the empty list.

To fix this issue, the pattern used in the regular expression needs to be adjusted. It seems that the regular expression is not capturing the correct text from the `command.output` string. Additionally, it is essential to handle cases where the regular expressions do not find a match to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "(.*?)"', command.output)
    suggested_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "(.*?)"', command.output)

    if broken_match and suggested_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = suggested_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the `command.output`.
- Inside the `if` condition, we check if both `broken_match` and `suggested_match` are not `None`, then we extract the relevant groups using `group(1)` and replace the broken command with the new command.
- If either of the patterns is not found, we return the original `command.script`.

This approach ensures that we cover cases where the regular expressions do not find a match and handle them gracefully.
