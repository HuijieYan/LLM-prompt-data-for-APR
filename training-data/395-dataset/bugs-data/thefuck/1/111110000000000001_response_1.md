The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to access the `output` attribute of the `command` object, but it seems like `command` is not an object with an `output` attribute.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to access the `output` attribute of the `command` object without checking if it exists or if `command` is even an object that has an `output` attribute. 

To fix the bug, we need to pass the `output` as an argument to the `get_new_command` function. Additionally, we need to import the `re` module to use the `findall` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, output):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', output)[0]

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

In the corrected code, the `output` is passed as an argument to the `get_new_command` function, and the `re` module is imported to use the `findall` function. This will fix the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
