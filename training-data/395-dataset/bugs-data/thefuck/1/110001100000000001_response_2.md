Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the use of the re.findall() function, as it seems to be parsing the command output incorrectly.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the regular expressions used in the re.findall() function are not properly capturing the desired strings from the command output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to ensure that the regular expressions used in re.findall() are correctly capturing the specified strings from the command output.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    if broken_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        return None

    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    if new_cmd_match:
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        return None

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd, 1)
```
