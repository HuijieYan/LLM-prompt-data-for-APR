Potential Error Location:
The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]`. This line is attempting to extract the `broken` command from the `command.output`.

Reasons for the Bug:
The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that the regular expression used in the `re.findall` method did not find any matches in the `command.output`, leading to an empty list. Trying to access the first element of an empty list results in an IndexError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the result of `re.findall` is empty before trying to access its first element.
2. Verify that the regular expression patterns match the structure of the input string `command.output`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    if broken_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        return None  # Handle case where no matches are found

    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    if new_cmd_match:
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        return None  # Handle case where no matches are found

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

In the corrected code:
- The use of `re.findall` has been replaced with `re.search` to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.
- Check if the matches are found before accessing the groups to avoid IndexError.
- Handle cases where no matches are found and return None as necessary.
