The provided test case `test_get_new_command` provided a `script`, `broken`, `suggested`, and `new_cmd` and the expected output.

The error message indicates that the issue is related to an "IndexError" in the function `get_new_command` within the `pip_unknown_command.py` file. The error message also shows that the index is out of range when trying to access `command.output` which leads to the IndexError.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is trying to access an index of the result of `re.findall` without checking if the result is empty or not.

To fix the bug, the code should first check if the result of `re.findall` is not empty and then access the first element.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    
    if broken_cmd and new_cmd:
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd[0], new_cmd[0])
    else:
        return 'No new command found'
```

This updated code checks if both `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` are not empty before accessing the first element of the list. If either of them is empty, it returns 'No new command found'.
