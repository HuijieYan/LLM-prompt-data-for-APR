The error is occurring because the `re.findall` function is unable to find a match for the regular expressions in the `command.output` string, resulting in an empty list. This causes an IndexError when trying to access the first element of the empty list.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where no match is found in the `command.output` string. We can use `re.search` to find a single match and handle both cases: when the match is found and when it is not.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```
