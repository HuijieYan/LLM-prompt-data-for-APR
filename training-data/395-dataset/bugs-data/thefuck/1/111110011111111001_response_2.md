The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function. The function is trying to extract the broken command and the suggested command from the `command.output` using regular expressions and then replace the broken command in the `command.script` with the suggested command.

The error message indicates that the index is out of range, which means that the `re.findall` function is not finding any matches or is not returning a list with at least one element. This is likely due to the regular expression pattern not matching the input string.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expression patterns to ensure they match the input string correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "(.*?)"', command.output)
    if broken_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        # Handle the case where the broken command is not found
        return None

    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "(.*?)"', command.output)
    if new_cmd_match:
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        # Handle the case where the new command is not found
        return None

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

This code handles the cases where the regular expression matches do not find any results by checking the matches before accessing their groups. If a match is not found, the function returns `None`. This way, we prevent the index out of range error from occurring.
