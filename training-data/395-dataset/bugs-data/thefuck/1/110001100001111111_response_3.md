The bug in the provided code is due to the use of the `re.findall` method which returns a list of all occurrences of the pattern in the input string. In this case, the code assumes that there will be at least one match for each regular expression, which may not always be true, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access index 0 of the result.

The potential error location is the lines that extract `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` from the output using `re.findall`:

```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where no match is found for the regular expression. We can use a conditional check to ensure that there is at least one match before accessing index 0 of the result.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    
    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command if no match is found
```
