The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `re.findall` function calls, specifically in the indexing of the returned lists.

The error message from the test function indicates that the index used to access the elements of the lists returned by the `re.findall` function is out of range. This means that the regular expression patterns are not matching the input `command.output` as expected, and therefore the lists returned by `re.findall` are empty.

The bug is likely occurring because the regular expressions used in `re.findall` are not correctly matching the input `command.output` string, which leads to empty lists being returned. As a result, when the code tries to access the first element of these empty lists, it causes an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the regular expressions used in `re.findall` need to be adjusted to correctly match the patterns in the input `command.output` string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([^"]+)"', command.output)
    suggested_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([^"]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and suggested_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = suggested_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```
