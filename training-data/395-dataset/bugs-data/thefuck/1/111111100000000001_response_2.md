Potential error location: 
The potential error is with the use of `re.findall` which returns a list, but the code is accessing the first element directly instead of checking if the list is not empty.

Reason behind the bug:
The error is occurring because the code assumes that the output of the `re.findall` function will always have a result, without first checking if there were any matches.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the result of `re.findall` is not empty before accessing the first element.
2. Handle cases where no matches are found in a different way, such as raising an exception or returning a default value.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return "No matches found"
```
