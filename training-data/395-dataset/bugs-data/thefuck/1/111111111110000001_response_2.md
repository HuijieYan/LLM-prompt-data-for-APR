The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" specifically at the line `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]` in the `get_new_command` function. This error occurs when the `re.findall` function does not find any matches, resulting in an empty list, and trying to access the first element of an empty list causes the IndexError.

The reason behind this bug is that the regular expression used in the `re.findall` function may not find any matches in the `command.output`, resulting in an empty list.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `re.findall` does not find any matches. We can use an `if` statement to check if there are any matches before trying to access the first element of the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if len(broken_cmd_match) > 0 and len(new_cmd_match) > 0:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # or handle this case accordingly based on the requirements
``` 

This corrected code handles the case where `re.findall` does not find any matches by checking the length of the lists returned by `re.findall` before trying to access the first elements. If no matches are found, the original command script is returned, or the case can be handled according to the specific requirements.
