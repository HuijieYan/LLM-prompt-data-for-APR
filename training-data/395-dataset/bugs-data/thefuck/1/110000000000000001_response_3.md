Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is with the `re.findall()` function. It seems like the `command.output` variable is being accessed incorrectly or is not being used in the intended way.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the `re.findall()` function is attempting to match patterns in `command.output` without properly extracting the `command.output` string from the command object. This is causing the function to throw an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `command.output` variable is accessed correctly and contains the expected string.
2. Check if the `re.findall()` function is returning the expected matches and is being used correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    error_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    if error_match:
        broken_cmd = error_match.group(1)
        new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
        if new_cmd_match:
            new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
            return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    return command.script
```
