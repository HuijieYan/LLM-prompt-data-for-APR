Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the use of `command.output` without importing the `re` module.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `re` module is not imported, so the `re.findall` function cannot be used.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the `re` module at the beginning of the script to use its functions.
2. Handle cases where no match is found by checking the length of the result of `re.findall()` before trying to access the first element.
3. Ensure that the `replace_argument` function is defined and working correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd and new_cmd:
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd[0], new_cmd[0])
    else:
        return "No matches found"
```
