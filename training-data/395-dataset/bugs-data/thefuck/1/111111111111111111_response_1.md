The bug occurs in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the `broken_cmd` line. The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" is raised when trying to access an index of a list that does not exist.

The reason for the bug is that the regular expression `re.findall` is not finding any matches in the `command.output`, so when we try to access the first element using `[0]`, it raises an IndexError because the list is empty.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `re.findall` does not find any matches. We can use an if statement to check if there are any matches before trying to access the first element.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmds = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmds = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmds and new_cmds:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmds[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmds[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected code checks if there are any matches for both `broken_cmds` and `new_cmds`. If there are no matches, it simply returns the original `command.script`. If there are matches, it proceeds with the replacement.
