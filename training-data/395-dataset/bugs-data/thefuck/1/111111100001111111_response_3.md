The error occurs in the function `get_new_command` at the line:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                        command.output)[0]
```
The error is occurring because the regular expression is not matching the given `command.output`, resulting in an empty list. This causes the subsequent line to throw an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of the empty list.

To fix this, we need to update the regular expressions to match the `command.output` correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command if no matches are found
``` 

This code uses `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to find the matches correctly, and it also checks if both matches are found before extracting the broken and new command. If matches are not found, it returns the original command.
