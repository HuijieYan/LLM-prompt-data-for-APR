## Analysis
The `get_new_command` function is intended to extract the broken and suggested commands from the `command.output`, and then replace the broken command with the suggested command in the `command.script`.

The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` in the `get_new_command` function when trying to access the elements of the lists returned by `re.findall`. This means that the regular expressions used in `re.findall` might not be matching the expected patterns in the `command.output`.

## Error Location
The error is likely occurring in the lines:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```
in the `get_new_command` function.

## Reasons behind the Bug
The bug is occurring because the regular expression patterns are not matching the expected strings in the `command.output`, leading to empty lists returned by `re.findall`. As a result, trying to access the first element of an empty list with `[0]` causes the `IndexError`.

## Possible Approaches
1. Check the regular expressions to ensure they are correctly capturing the intended patterns in the `command.output`.
2. Add error handling to handle cases where `re.findall` returns an empty list.
3. Verify the structure and content of `command.output` to determine if the expected strings are present.

## Corrected Code
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmds = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmds = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    
    # Check if the lists are not empty
    if broken_cmds and new_cmds:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmds[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmds[0]
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original script if no replacements are found
```
