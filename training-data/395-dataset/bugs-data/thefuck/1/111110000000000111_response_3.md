The error is occurring in the get_new_command function where there are two calls to the re.findall method. The error message indicates that the list index is out of range, meaning that the regular expressions are not able to find a match in the command output.

The reason for the bug is that the regular expressions used in the findall method are not matching the expected patterns in the command output, resulting in an empty list and causing the index out of range error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the regular expressions used in findall method are correctly matching the patterns in the command output. Additionally, we can add error handling to avoid index out of range error.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    
    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original script if the patterns are not found
```

In the corrected code, we used re.search instead of re.findall to find the matching patterns in the command output. We also added error handling to check if the patterns are found before extracting the commands. If the patterns are not found, the original script is returned.
