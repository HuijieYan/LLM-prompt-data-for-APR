The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function where the `IndexError` is raised. This error is raised when the `re.findall` function does not find a match for the specified regular expression pattern.

The bug is occurring because the `re.findall` function is not finding a match in the `command.output`. This is likely due to an issue with the regular expression pattern not matching the expected output.

To fix this bug, we can add error handling to check if a match is found before attempting to access the first element of the result. We can also use more specific regular expression patterns to ensure a match is found.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    if broken_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        return None  # Return None if no match is found for the broken command

    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    if new_cmd_match:
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        return None  # Return None if no match is found for the new command

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

With these changes, we check for matches using the regular expression patterns and return `None` if no match is found. This will prevent the `IndexError` and provide a way to handle cases where a match is not found.
