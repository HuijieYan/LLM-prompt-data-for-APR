The error in the `get_new_command` function is caused by attempting to access an index of a list that doesn't exist. This is happening because the `re.findall` function is not returning any matches, and the code is still trying to access the first element of the resulting list.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the result of `re.findall` is not empty before accessing its elements. We can also add error handling in case the pattern is not found in the input.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_matches = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_matches = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_matches and new_matches:
        broken_cmd = broken_matches[0]
        new_cmd = new_matches[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return "Unable to correct command"
```
