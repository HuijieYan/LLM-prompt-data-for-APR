The error in the code is occurring in the function `get_new_command` in the file `pip_unknown_command.py`. The error is due to the use of `re.findall` to extract values from the command output, which leads to a `IndexError` when the pattern is not found in the output.

The script in the test case is `pip un+install thefuck` and the new command output is `pip uninstall thefuck`. The `pip_unknown_cmd` is 'ERROR: unknown command "un+install" - maybe you meant "uninstall"'.

To fix this bug:
- We can use `re.search` instead of `re.findall` so that if the pattern is not found, it does not result in an `IndexError`.
- We should also handle the case where the pattern is not found and return a default value if it's not found.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "(.*?)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "(.*?)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)

    return command.script  # Return the original command if patterns not found
```

By using `re.search` and checking if the matches are found, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and handle the case when the patterns are not found in the output.
