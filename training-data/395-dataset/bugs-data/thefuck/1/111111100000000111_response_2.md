The error in the provided code is occurring due to an IndexError. This error is raised when the code tries to access an index of a list that doesn't exist.

The potential error location in the code is the lines where the re.findall function is used to find matches in the output of the command.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is assuming that there will always be matches for the regular expressions used, resulting in an IndexError when no matches are found.

To fix the bug, we need to check if matches are found before accessing them in the list. We can use an if statement to ensure that the index exists before accessing it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.stderr)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.stderr)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]

        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return None  # Handle the case when no matches are found
```

In the corrected code, we first check if both broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match lists have elements before accessing the index. If either of them is empty, we return None to handle the case when no matches are found.
