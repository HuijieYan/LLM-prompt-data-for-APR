The error message indicates that the index is out of range when trying to access an element of the list returned by `re.findall`. This suggests that the regular expressions used in the function are not matching the input correctly, resulting in an empty list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `re.findall` calls.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expressions used in the `re.findall` calls are not matching the input correctly. As a result, the lists returned by `re.findall` are empty, leading to the IndexError when trying to access the first element.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expressions to correctly match the input and handle cases where no match is found.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'unknown command "(.*)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "(.*)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This code uses `re.search` to find matches for the broken command and the suggested new command. It then checks if both matches are found and retrieves the corresponding groups. If both matches are found, it replaces the broken command with the new command in the original script. If no matches are found, it returns the original script.
