The error occurs at the line `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]` in the `get_new_command` function. The error message shows that the `IndexError` is caused because the result of `re.findall` is an empty list, and then trying to access the first element (`[0]`) of this empty list causes the `IndexError`.

This error occurs because `re.findall` returns an empty list when no matches are found for the given pattern in the `command.output`.

To fix the bug, we can check if the result of `re.findall` is an empty list and only access the first element if the list is not empty. If the list is empty, we can handle this case appropriately, for example, by returning the original command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:  # Ensure both matches are found
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command if matches are not found
```

In the corrected function, we first check if both matches are found before accessing the first elements of the lists. If matches are found, we proceed to use them for the replacement; otherwise, we simply return the original command. This should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
