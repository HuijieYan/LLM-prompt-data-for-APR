The buggy function is attempting to extract the broken command and the suggested new command from the `command.output` using `re.findall`. It then uses these values to replace the argument in the command script. However, the function is throwing an IndexError because the regular expressions are not matching the expected patterns in some cases.

The bug occurs because the regular expressions are not matching the provided `command.output` in some cases, leading to empty lists and causing the `IndexError` when trying to access the first element.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expressions to ensure they capture the correct values. Additionally, we should handle cases where the regular expressions do not match by adding appropriate error handling.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'unknown command "([^"]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([^"]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return ""  # or handle the error in a suitable way
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly extract the broken and new commands, and it should handle cases where the regular expressions do not match.
