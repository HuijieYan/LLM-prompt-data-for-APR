The error is occurring in the function `get_new_command`. The error message indicates that the `IndexError: list index out of range` is occurring in this function.

The reason for the bug is that the function is trying to access the first element of the list returned by the `re.findall` function, but the list is empty. This happens when the pattern in `re.findall` does not match anything in the `command.output`.

To fix this bug, we should check if the result of `re.findall` is empty or not before trying to access its elements. If it's not empty, then we can proceed with replacing the argument in the command script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_result = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_result = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_result and new_cmd_result:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_result[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_result[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # If the pattern didn't match, return the original command script
```

With this correction, we check if both `broken_cmd_result` and `new_cmd_result` are not empty before accessing their elements. If they are empty, we return the original command script. If they are not empty, we proceed with replacing the argument and returning the updated command script.
