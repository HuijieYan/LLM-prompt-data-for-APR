The error is occurring because the function `get_new_command` is trying to access a list element that doesn't exist. This is indicated by the error message `IndexError: list index out of range`.

The potential error location is within the `get_new_command` function, particularly in the lines where the `re.findall` method is used to extract data from the command output.

The reason for the bug is that the regular expression used in the `re.findall` method is not finding any matches in the command output, which results in an empty list. Then, the function tries to access the first element of the empty list, resulting in an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case when `re.findall` doesn't find any matches in the command output. This can be done by checking if the list returned by `re.findall` is empty before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmds = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmds = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmds and new_cmds:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmds[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmds[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return None  # Return a default value or handle the case when no matches are found
```

By adding the check for the existence of matches in the command output, we can prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
