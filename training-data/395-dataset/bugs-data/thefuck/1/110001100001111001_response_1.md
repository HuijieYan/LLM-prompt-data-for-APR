The issue with the given function `get_new_command` is that it is using the `re.findall` method to extract the broken command and the new command from the output. However, the regular expression pattern is only capturing lowercase letters, which is why it's not capturing the full command in the case of "un+install" and "instatl".

To fix this issue, the regular expression pattern should be updated to capture any characters between the double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"(.+?)\"', command.output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"(.+?)\"', command.output)[0]

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

With this updated regular expression pattern, the function will correctly capture the broken and new commands from the output, fixing the bug.
