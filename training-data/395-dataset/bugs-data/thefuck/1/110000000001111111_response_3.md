The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function where the `re` module is used to match patterns in the `command.output` string. The `re.findall` function is used, which returns a list of all occurrences of a pattern in the string. However, the code assumes that these patterns will always be found at index 0, which leads to the "list index out of range" error when the patterns are not found.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the patterns are found before trying to access them at index 0. If they are found, then we can proceed with the replacement of the broken command with the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    if broken_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        # Handle the case when the pattern is not found, possibly raise an exception or return a default value
        # For now, let's assume a default value
        broken_cmd = ''

    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    if new_cmd_match:
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        # Handle the case when the pattern is not found, possibly raise an exception or return a default value
        # For now, let's assume a default value
        new_cmd = ''

    if broken_cmd and new_cmd:
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        # Handle the case when either broken_cmd or new_cmd is not found
        # For now, let's return the original command script
        return command.script
```

With these changes, the function will first check if the patterns are found before trying to access them. If they are found, it will proceed with the replacement; otherwise, it will handle the cases where either the broken command or the new command is not found.
