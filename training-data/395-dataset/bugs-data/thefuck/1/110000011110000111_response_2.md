The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function when trying to extract values using `re.findall()`. It seems that the regular expressions used in the `re.findall()` function are not matching the input string `command.output`.

The potential error location is in the lines:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expressions used in the `re.findall()` function are not matching the input string `command.output`. This is leading to an empty list resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of the list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the regular expressions used in `re.findall()` match the input string `command.output`. We can also add checks to handle cases where there are no matches for the regular expressions.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_matches = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.output)
    new_matches = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_matches and new_matches:
        broken_cmd = broken_matches[0]
        new_cmd = new_matches[0]
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

In this corrected code, we first use `re.findall()` to find matches for the broken command and suggested command. Then, we use conditional statements to check if matches were found before accessing the first elements of the lists. If matches are found, we replace the broken command with the suggested command in the `command.script`. If no matches are found, we return the original `command.script`.
