The error occurs in the function `get_new_command` in the file `pip_unknown_command.py`. The bug is caused by the `IndexError` due to the `re.findall` method not finding a match and returning an empty list, which causes the index out of range error when trying to access the first element.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the result of `re.findall` is not empty before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_matches = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_matches = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_matches and new_cmd_matches:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_matches[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_matches[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

In the corrected code, we first check if both `broken_cmd_matches` and `new_cmd_matches` are not empty before accessing their elements to avoid the `IndexError`. If they are not empty, we proceed to extract the broken and new commands as before. If they are empty, we return the original command script `command.script`. This ensures that the function does not crash when there are no matches found.
