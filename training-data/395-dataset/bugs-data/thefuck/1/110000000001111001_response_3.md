The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `re.findall` method. It seems that the regular expressions used in the `re.findall` method are not capturing the correct values from the `command.output` string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expressions are not properly matching the patterns in the `command.output` string.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expressions used in the `re.findall` method to correctly capture the values of the broken command and the new command from the `command.output` string.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([^"]+)"', command.output).group(1)
    new_cmd = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([^"]+)"', command.output).group(1)

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

In this corrected code, we use `re.search` to capture the values of the broken command and the new command using the correct regular expressions. Then, we simply use the `replace` method to replace the `broken_cmd` with the `new_cmd` in the `command.script`. This should fix the bug and provide the expected results.
