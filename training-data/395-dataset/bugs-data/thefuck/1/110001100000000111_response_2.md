Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function at the line:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.stderr)[0]
```

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error is occurring because the regular expression `r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"'` is trying to find a lowercase word in the `command.stderr`, but it seems like the word is not present in the stderr or the regular expression might not be matching the expected pattern.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the regular expression is matching the expected pattern in the `command.stderr`.
2. Handle the case where the regular expression does not find a match to avoid the IndexError.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.stderr)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.stderr)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return ''  # Handle the case where the regex does not match
```
