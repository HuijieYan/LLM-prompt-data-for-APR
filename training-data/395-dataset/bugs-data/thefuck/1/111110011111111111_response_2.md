The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` is caused by the `IndexError: list index out of range`. This error occurs because the `re.findall` function does not find any matches and returns an empty list, causing the attempt to access the first element `[0]` of the list to result in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where `re.findall` does not find any matches. We can also use a more robust approach to extract the broken and new commands.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

In the corrected function:
- We use `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to find the matches.
- We check if both the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` matches exist before extracting the values.
- If the matches exist, we extract the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` using the `group(1)` method of the match object.
- If the matches do not exist, we return the original `command.script` without any replacements.
- This updated approach ensures that we handle cases where no matches are found and avoid the IndexError.
