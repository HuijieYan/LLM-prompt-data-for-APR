The bug in the `get_new_command` function occurs because the regular expression `re.findall` does not find a match for the pattern in the `command.output` string. This results in an empty list, and when the function tries to access the first element of this list with `[0]`, it raises an `IndexError: list index out of range`. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the function `get_new_command` to handle cases where the regular expressions do not find a match. We can check if the result of `re.findall` is not empty before trying to access the first element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if not broken_cmd_match or not new_cmd_match:
        return command.script  # Return the original command if no match is found

    broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
    new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

This corrected function checks if the `broken_cmd_match` and `new_cmd_match` are not empty before proceeding to access the first elements. If they are empty, it returns the original `command.script` without attempting to replace anything. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring.

With this correction, the test case should now pass without raising an error.
