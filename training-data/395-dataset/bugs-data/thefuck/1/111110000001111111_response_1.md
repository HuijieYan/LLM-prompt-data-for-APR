The buggy function is attempting to extract the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` from the `command.output` and then replace the `broken_cmd` with the `new_cmd` in the `command.script`. The function is using regular expressions to achieve this.

The bug is occurring because the regular expressions used in the `re.findall` statements are not matching the input correctly, leading to an empty list and causing the IndexError in the subsequent code.

To fix this bug, the regular expressions used in the `re.findall` statements should be updated to correctly match the input and extract the desired values.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([^"]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([^"]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

In the corrected code:
1. We use `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to find the matching groups within the input string.
2. We check if both matches are successful before extracting the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd`.
3. If both matches are successful, we replace the `broken_cmd` with the `new_cmd` in the `command.script`. If not, we return the original `command.script`.
