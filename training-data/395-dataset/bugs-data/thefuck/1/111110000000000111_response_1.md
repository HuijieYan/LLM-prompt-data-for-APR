The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the `pip_unknown_command.py` rule file. It seems that the `re.findall` method does not find any matches in the `command.stderr` when trying to extract the broken command and new command.

The reason for this bug is that the regular expressions used in the `pip_unknown_command.py` rule are not matching the expected patterns in the `command.stderr`. This is likely due to changes in the output format of the `pip` command over different versions.

To fix this issue, we need to update the regular expressions to match the current output format of the `pip` command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'\'([a-z]+)\' - maybe you meant', command.stderr)
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \'([a-z]+)\'', command.stderr)

    if broken_cmd and new_cmd:
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd[0], new_cmd[0])
    else:
        return None
```

In this corrected code, we've updated the regular expressions to match the expected patterns in the `command.stderr`. We also added a check to ensure that the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` lists are not empty before trying to access their first elements. If they are empty, it means that no matches were found and we return `None`.
