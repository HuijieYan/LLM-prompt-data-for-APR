The potential error in the provided function is with the usage of the `re.findall` function. The error arises because `re.findall` returns a list of all matches for the pattern in the input string, but the code is attempting to access the first match directly without checking if there is actually a match.

The code is trying to extract the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` values from the `command.output` by using regular expressions. However, it does not handle cases where the regular expression does not match anything in the `command.output`, which leads to an "IndexError" when trying to access the first element of an empty list.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there are any matches before trying to access them. We can do this by using an if statement and the `re.search` function to handle the case when there is no match.

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return "No match found"
```
