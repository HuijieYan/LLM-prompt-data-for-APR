The bug in the given function occurs because the regular expressions used in the `get_new_command` function are failing to match the expected patterns in the `command.output` string.

The `re.findall` function is returning an empty list when trying to match the patterns, causing the subsequent indexing `[0]` to fail and resulting in the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the regular expressions to ensure they match the expected patterns in the `command.output` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'unknown command "(.*?)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "(.*?)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```
