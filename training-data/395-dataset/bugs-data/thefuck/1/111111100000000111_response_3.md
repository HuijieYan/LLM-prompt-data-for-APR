The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function of the `pip_unknown_command.py` file. The function attempts to extract the broken command and new command from the output of the original command, but it encounters an IndexError when trying to access the elements of the lists returned by `re.findall`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function assumes that both the broken and new commands will always be found in the output, leading to the use of `[0]` to access the first element of the returned lists.
2. If the regular expressions do not match the output, an IndexError will occur, as observed in the error message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add checks to ensure that the regular expressions have matched before attempting to access the elements of the returned lists.
2. Handle cases where the regular expressions do not match by providing default values.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.stderr)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.stderr)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return "Error: Command not found in the output."
```
