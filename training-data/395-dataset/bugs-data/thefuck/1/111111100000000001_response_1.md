Potential error location: The potential error lies in the use of `re.findall` and accessing the first element of the result without checking if the result is empty.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `re.findall` method returns a list of all occurrences of the pattern in the input string. If no matches are found, it returns an empty list.
2. The code does not check if the result of `re.findall` is empty before accessing its first element. This can lead to an IndexError if no matches are found.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the result of `re.findall` is empty before accessing its first element to avoid the IndexError.
2. Add error handling to handle cases where no matches are found for the patterns.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0] if broken_cmd_match else ""
    new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0] if new_cmd_match else ""

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
