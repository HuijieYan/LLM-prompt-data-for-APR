The potential error in the `get_new_command` function is with the use of `re.findall` and accessing the first element of the resulting list without checking if the list is empty.

The reason for the bug is that the `re.findall` method returns an empty list if no match is found, and then trying to access the first element of the empty list causes the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the result of `re.findall` is not empty before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

In this corrected code, we first check if both `broken_cmd_match` and `new_cmd_match` are not empty lists before accessing their elements. If they are not empty, then we proceed with using their elements to replace the argument in the command script. If they are empty, we simply return the original command script.
