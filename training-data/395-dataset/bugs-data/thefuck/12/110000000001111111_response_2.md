The buggy function uses the `@sudo_support` decorator, which is not a standard Python decorator. Assuming that the `get_close_matches` and `get_all_executables` functions are correct, the issue with the current implementation is that it does not handle the command output correctly.

The function is supposed to return `True` if the command was not found, but there are potential issues with the logic and the way it handles the command output and script parts.

The potential issues with the current implementation are:
1. The function relies on the presence of 'not found' in the command stderr, which may not always be the case.
2. The function does not handle the output of the command script properly and relies on partial matches, which may not be accurate.

To fix this, the function can be modified to explicitly check for the presence of 'not found' in the stderr and handle the script parts and command output more accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches

def match(command):
    if 'not found' in command.stderr:
        return True
    else:
        executable = command.script_parts[0]
        return executable in get_all_executables() or get_close_matches(executable, get_all_executables())
```

In this corrected implementation, we explicitly check for the presence of 'not found' in the command stderr, and then we check if the script parts are present in the list of all executables. If not, we use `get_close_matches` to find potential matches. This approach ensures more accurate matching of the command script and provides a more reliable check for whether the command was not found.
