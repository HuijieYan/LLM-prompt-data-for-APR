The error message states that the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command' does not have the attribute 'which', which is being patched in the test case. This suggests that the 'which' attribute is not present in the 'no_command.py' module, causing the AttributeError.

The buggy function 'match' is trying to access the 'which' attribute from the 'no_command' module, but it seems that the 'which' attribute is not defined in the module. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to patch the attribute in the test cases.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to define the 'which' attribute within the 'no_command.py' module. This can be achieved by either importing the 'which' attribute from another module or defining it within the 'no_command.py' file.

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

# Import the 'which' attribute from another module or define it here
from some_module import which  # Example if 'which' is in some_module

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

By defining the 'which' attribute within the 'no_command.py' file, the AttributeError should be resolved, and the test cases should be able to patch the 'which' attribute as expected.

Remember to replace 'some_module' with the actual name of the module where the 'which' attribute is defined.
