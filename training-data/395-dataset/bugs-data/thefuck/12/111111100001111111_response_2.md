The buggy function seems to be checking for the presence of the string "not found" in the command's stderr and whether the command's script_parts have any close matches with the available executables. However, the buggy function has multiple issues in handling the input and does not return the correct result. It has been diagnosed as the buggy function is not checking if 'not found' is part of the stderr for all cases where this condition needs to be checked.

To fix the issues, the following corrections can be made:
1. Ensure that the "not found" condition is checked for all cases when matching the command.
2. Use better conditional checks to correctly identify whether the script is available or not.
3. Refactor the function to improve readability and maintainability.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    if 'not found' in command.stderr:
        return False  # If "not found" is present in the error message, there is no need to look for close matches
    if command.script_parts and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The corrected function ensures that 'not found' is first checked in the error message and then looks for close matches if the executable is available. This should resolve the issues in the buggy function and provide the correct result for all test cases.
