The error in the provided function is that it is missing the definition of the decorator `sudo_support`. Assuming that `sudo_support` is meant to handle permission-related issues, it should be defined before being used as a decorator.

Additionally, the code is using the function `get_close_matches` and `get_all_executables` without importing them or defining them in the current scope. These functions need to be imported or defined before using them.

Lastly, the function is missing the indentation for the decorator and the body of the function.

To fix the bug:
1. Define the `sudo_support` decorator or remove it if it's not necessary.
2. Import or define the `get_close_matches` and `get_all_executables` functions.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches

# Define sudo_support if necessary
def sudo_support(func):
    # Add sudo support logic if necessary
    pass

# Corrected function
def match(command):
    if (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr):
        return bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables()))
    else:
        return False
```
