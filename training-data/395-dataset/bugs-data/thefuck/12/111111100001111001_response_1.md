The current function is using the `get_close_matches()` function, but it's not imported or defined anywhere in the given code. Additionally, the `sudo_support` decorator is used, but it's not defined in the provided code.

To fix the given function, we need to import the necessary modules and define the `sudo_support` decorator if it's a custom decorator. Also, from the buggy function and the provided test cases, it seems the function is trying to check if the command exists in the executable files.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Import necessary module
from difflib import get_close_matches

# Correction to the buggy function
def match(command):
    if command.script_parts and 'not found' in command.stderr:
        first_command_part = command.script_parts[0]
        all_executables = get_all_executables()
        if get_close_matches(first_command_part, all_executables):
            return True
    return False
```

This corrected code will properly use the `get_close_matches()` function and check if the first part of the command exists in the list of executable files. It also removes the `sudo_support` decorator, assuming it was mistakenly included in the original code.
