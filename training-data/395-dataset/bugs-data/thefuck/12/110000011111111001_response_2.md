The error is occurring because the `@sudo_support` decorator is missing, and it is applied to the `match` function. This is causing the code to break while running the test cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `@sudo_support` decorator is missing from the `match` function, but it is used in the test case. This causes the `sudo_support` to be invoked on `match`, potentially causing an `AttributeError` when the function is being patched, as `which` attribute is expected to be available on the module `thefuck.rules.no_command`, which is not available.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to add the `@sudo_support` decorator to the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

Adding the `@sudo_support` decorator to the `match` function will ensure that the decorator is included, and the function should work as intended when the test cases are run.
