The error message indicates that the 'which' attribute is not present in the 'no_command' module. This leads to the 'mocker.patch' functionality failing in the test cases.

The reason behind this bug is that the 'which' function is not imported or defined in the 'no_command' module.

To fix this bug, the 'which' function needs to be imported or defined in the 'no_command' module. Alternatively, if the 'which' function is supposed to be available as a global function, it needs to be imported from the appropriate module.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import sudo_support, get_all_executables

# the corrected function
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
