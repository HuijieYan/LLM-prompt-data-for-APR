The error occurs because the function `match` is using a decorator `@sudo_support` which is not defined anywhere. This causes an AttributeError when trying to access the `which` attribute.

To fix this issue, the `@sudo_support` decorator needs to be defined or removed from the `match` function if it's not necessary.

The corrected code for the problematic function `match` without the `@sudo_support` decorator is as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
