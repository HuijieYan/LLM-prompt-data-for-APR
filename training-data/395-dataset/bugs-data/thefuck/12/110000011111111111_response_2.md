The main issue with the `match` function is that it uses a decorator `@sudo_support` which is not a standard Python decorator or a decorator from any library like `functools`. This is causing the error in the test cases as it is unable to identify the which attribute from the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module.

In order to fix the bug:
1. Remove the `@sudo_support` decorator from the `match` function as it seems to be causing the issues.
2. Modify the `match` function to process the input parameters `command.script_parts` and `command.stderr` and return the expected output based on those parameters.

Here is the corrected `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    from difflib import get_close_matches
    from shutil import which

    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       [cmd[0] for cmd in map(str.split, which(":".join([''] + command.script.split())))])))
```

These changes should resolve the issue with the `match` function.
