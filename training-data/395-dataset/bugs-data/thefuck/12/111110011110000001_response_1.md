The error message indicates that the 'which' attribute is not found in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module. This is likely due to the fact that the 'which' function does not exist in the 'no_command' module.

To fix this issue, the 'which' function should be imported from another module and used in the 'match' function.

Here is the corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
# Corrected match function
from shutil import which

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

In this corrected code, the 'which' function is imported from the 'shutil' module, which provides access to some of the functionalities of the command line. This should address the issue of the 'which' attribute not being found.
