The issue with the provided function is that it is using the `@sudo_support` decorator, but it is not defined in the code. Additionally, the `get_close_matches` function and the `get_all_executables` function are not imported.

To fix this issue, we can remove the `@sudo_support` decorator and import the necessary functions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from shutil import which

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], which(command.script_parts[0]))))
```
