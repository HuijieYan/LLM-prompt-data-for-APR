The issue with the provided function is that it is using a decorator `@sudo_support` without defining it. This is causing the test functions to fail because the `@sudo_support` decorator is not being recognized and it doesn't seem to serve a purpose in the given context.

The potential error location is the `@sudo_support` decorator in the `match` function. It seems that this decorator is unnecessary and causing issues.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the presence of an undefined decorator `@sudo_support`. It's unclear what the purpose of this decorator is in the given context, and it's not being properly imported or defined, which is causing the test functions to fail.

To fix the bug, the `@sudo_support` decorator can be removed from the `match` function as it doesn't seem to serve a purpose in the provided context.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

With the `@sudo_support` decorator removed, the function should work as intended and the test functions should pass.
