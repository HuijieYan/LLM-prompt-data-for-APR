The potential error in the provided code is the decorator @sudo_support, which is not a standard Python decorator and appears to be causing the bug.

The buggy function is using a decorator that is not defined or standard in Python, likely resulting in a syntax error or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the non-standard decorator @sudo_support should be removed and the function should be defined as a regular function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
