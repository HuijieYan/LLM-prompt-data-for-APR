The buggy function `match` seems to be intended to check if the command is not found based on the input command and its output. It uses the `get_close_matches` function from an unknown library to compare the input command with all executables.

The issue seems to be with the usage of `@sudo_support` as a decorator. It appears that `@sudo_support` is intended to handle privilege escalation using sudo, but it is not defined in the provided code.

The possible error location is the `@sudo_support` decorator, as it is not defined and could be causing issues when trying to execute the function.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to remove the `@sudo_support` decorator if it is not necessary for the function.

The corrected code for the function would be as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

By removing the undefined `@sudo_support` decorator, the function should be able to run without any issues related to the decorator being undefined.
