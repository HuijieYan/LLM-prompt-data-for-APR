```python
# this is the corrected function provided below
def _no_command():
    @sudo_support
    def match(command):
        return (command.script_parts
                and 'not found' in command.stderr
                and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                           get_all_executables())))
    return match

```
The function `match` needed to be nested inside another function and correctly indented. Now, `match` is nested inside `_no_command` and `sudo_support` decorator has also been added before the `match` function.
