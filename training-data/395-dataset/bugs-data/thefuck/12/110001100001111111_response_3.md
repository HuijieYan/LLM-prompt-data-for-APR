The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command is not found and then suggest possible alternatives based on the available executables. It does this by checking if the script parts are not empty, the "not found" string is in the command stderr, and if there are any close matches with the command script.

The bug is likely in the comparison of the command script with the available executables. The function `get_close_matches` is likely not being imported, and even if it was, the `get_all_executables()` is also not defined. This could result in a NameError if those functions are not available in the scope of the `match` function.

To fix this, the following changes can be made:
1. Import the required functions.
2. Include error handling to catch any potential exceptions that may occur from these function calls.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from some_module import get_all_executables  # Replace some_module with the actual module name

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    if hasattr(command, 'script_parts') and hasattr(command, 'stderr'):
        if command.script_parts and 'not found' in command.stderr:
            executable = command.script_parts[0]
            all_executables = get_all_executables()  # Assuming this function returns a list of executables
            return bool(get_close_matches(executable, all_executables))
    return False
```
