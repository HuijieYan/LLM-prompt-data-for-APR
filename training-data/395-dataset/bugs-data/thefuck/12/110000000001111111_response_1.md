Potential error location:
The potential error is in the logic of the `match` function where it checks for the presence of 'not found' in the command.stderr and then uses the `get_close_matches` function to check for close matching executables. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy function does not handle the input cases correctly. It assumes that the 'not found' error in stderr can reliably indicate that the command was not found, but this assumption is not always true. Additionally, the logic to check for close matching executables may not always produce accurate results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic to handle the error messages in stderr more accurately.
2. Use a more robust method to determine if the command was not found, rather than relying solely on the presence of 'not found' in the stderr.
3. Implement a more reliable method to determine close matching executables.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from difflib import get_close_matches

def match(command):
    if (command.script_parts and 
        (command.stderr.startswith(command.script_parts[0] + ': command not found') or
        'No such file or directory' in command.stderr)):
        return bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables()))
    else:
        return False
```
