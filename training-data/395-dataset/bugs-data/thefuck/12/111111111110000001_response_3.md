The error message indicates that the 'which' attribute is not found in the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command'. This implies that the 'which' attribute is not defined in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module, which causes the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to define the 'which' attribute in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module or import it from another module.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

In this corrected code, the 'which' attribute has been replaced with the 'get_close_matches' function, which is imported from the 'difflib' module. Additionally, the 'get_all_executables' function that is used within the 'get_close_matches' function is imported from the 'thefuck.utils' module. These changes allow the 'match' function to work as intended without raising an AttributeError for the 'which' attribute.
