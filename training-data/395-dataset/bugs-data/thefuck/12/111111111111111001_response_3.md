The error occurs because the `which` attribute is being patched using the `mocker` but it doesn't exist in the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module. This error is consistent with the test case as well, where the patching of `which` attribute causes an AttributeError.

To fix this, we need to assess the usage of the `which` attribute and determine an appropriate patching strategy for it.

The `which` attribute should exist in the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module, otherwise, it should be imported from another module or defined within the module.

Once the `which` attribute is appropriately available in the module, the test cases should be updated to reflect correct attribute patching or usage.

The corrected implementation of the function without considering the availability of the `which` attribute would be as follows:

```python
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and any(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```

This implementation assumes that the `get_all_executables` method is available and correctly retrieves a list of all available executables. However, the patching of the `which` attribute in the test cases suggests that the behavior of the `match` function might be related to the availability and behavior of the `which` attribute.

The ideal solution would involve ensuring that the `which` attribute is correctly available and used within the `match` function. If `which` attribute needs to be patched for testing purposes, it should be made available in the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module or imported from a module that contains its implementation.
