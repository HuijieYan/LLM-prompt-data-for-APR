Potential error:
The function is using the `@sudo_support` decorator, but it is not defined in the code provided. This will cause a syntax error when the function is called.

Reason for the bug:
The `@sudo_support` decorator is not defined, so it will cause a syntax error when used.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Remove the `@sudo_support` decorator from the function, as it is not defined in the provided code.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
