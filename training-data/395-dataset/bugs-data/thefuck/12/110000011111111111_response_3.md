The error occurs due to the use of a decorator `@sudo_support` in the function definition. The `@sudo_support` decorator is not defined or provided in the code. This causes the `match` function to raise an AttributeError when the `mocker.patch` method tries to access the attribute 'which' in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module.

In order to fix this, the decorator `@sudo_support` should be defined or removed from the `match` function. If the `@sudo_support` decorator serves a specific purpose, it should be properly implemented with its corresponding functionality. Otherwise, it should be removed.

Given the information provided, it is unclear what the intended functionality of the `@sudo_support` decorator is. Therefore, it will be omitted in the corrected version of the function.

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

By removing the `@sudo_support` decorator, the function `match` should no longer raise an AttributeError when it is being patched in the test cases.
