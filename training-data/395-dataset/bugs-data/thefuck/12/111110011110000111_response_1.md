The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when the test case tries to patch the 'which' attribute from the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module. This suggests that the 'which' attribute is not available in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module, causing the AttributeError.

The bug here is that the 'which' attribute is being patched with a return value, but the 'which' attribute itself is not present in the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command'. This is likely because the 'which' attribute is not defined in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module.

To fix this bug, you need to define the 'which' attribute in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module or import it from another module if it already exists elsewhere. Without access to the complete codebase and module structure, it's difficult to provide the exact implementation of the 'which' attribute.

Assuming the 'which' attribute is available in another module, the corrected function would look something like this:

```python
# assuming 'which' is available in a different module
from other_module import which

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

This assumes that the 'which' attribute is imported from another module called 'other_module'. If 'which' needs to be defined within the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module, the specific implementation would depend on its intended use.
