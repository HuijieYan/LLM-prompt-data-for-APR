Potential error location: 
The potential error is occurring in the 'get_close_matches' function, which is not imported from the difflib module or any other module. It seems that this function should be used to find the closest matches for the given command script but is not accessible in the current context.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. Missing import statement for the 'get_close_matches' function.
2. No reference to the module from which 'get_all_executables' is being called.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 'get_close_matches' function from the difflib module.
2. Make sure 'get_all_executables' is called from the correct module and is accessible in the current context.
3. Ensure that the necessary input parameters are being passed to the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

# corrected function
from difflib import get_close_matches

@sudo_support
def match(command, get_all_executables):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables)))
```
