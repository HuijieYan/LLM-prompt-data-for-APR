The bug seems to be caused by the missing `which` attribute in the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module. The `match` function also uses the `get_all_executables` function, which is not provided in the given code. 

To fix the bug:
1. The `which` attribute should be defined in the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module. It should be a function that returns the appropriate value based on the input parameter.
2. The `get_all_executables` function should be defined to provide the list of all executables available.
3. Modify the `match` function to ensure it properly checks for the presence of 'not found' in command.stderr.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Updated code for the match function
from difflib import get_close_matches

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))

# Sample implementation of 'which' function and 'get_all_executables' function
def which(command):
    # Implementation to return the appropriate value based on the input 'command'
    pass

def get_all_executables():
    # Implementation to return a list of all executables available
    pass
```
