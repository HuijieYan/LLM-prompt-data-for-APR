The buggy function seems to be checking if the command was not found based on the error message in the command.stderr. However, the function is also checking if the command is a close match to one of the executables. The issue could be related to the 'sudo_support' decorator and the function that is being used to retrieve the executables.

To fix the function, we need to remove the 'sudo_support' decorator and ensure that the get_all_executables() function is returning the correct list of executables.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and ('not found' in command.stderr or
                 bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables()))))
```

This code removes the '@sudo_support' decorator and adjusts the condition to check for 'not found' in the command.stderr or for close matches with the executables.
