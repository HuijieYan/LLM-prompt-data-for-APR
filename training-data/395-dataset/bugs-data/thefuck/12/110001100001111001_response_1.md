The function `match` is supposed to return True if the command is not found and has a close match among all executables, based on the input `command`. The potential error location is the check for 'not found' in the command.stderr, as it does not account for different variations of error messages.

The bug occurs because the function only checks for 'not found' in the command.stderr, which may not cover all cases where a command is not found. Additionally, the function does not handle different variations of error messages or output formats.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle different variations of error messages and output formats. It should also check for the existence of the command in the system's executables.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and any('not found' in error for error in (command.stderr, command.stdout))
            and any((get_close_matches(part, get_all_executables()) for part in command.script_parts)))
```
In this corrected code, we use the `any` function to check for 'not found' in both `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`. We also loop through the `command.script_parts` to check for close matches in the system's executables using `get_close_matches`. This allows the function to handle different variations of error messages and output formats, and also ensures that it checks for close matches in all parts of the command.
