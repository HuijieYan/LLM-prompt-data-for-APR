Potential error location:
The error seems to be caused by the missing "which" attribute in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module.

Reasons behind the bug:
The 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module does not contain the 'which' attribute, which is being patched in the test cases using the mocker.patch() method. This results in the AttributeError when the test cases are executed.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add the 'which' attribute to the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module so that it can be patched in the test cases.
2. Modify the test cases to patch an attribute that exists in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module.

```python
# Corrected function
from difflib import get_close_matches

# Assuming that 'which' is another module being used in the 'no_command.py' module
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

It is important to review and identify the exact module or attribute being patched in the test cases, and then ensure that it exists and is accessible within the 'no_command.py' module. Since the original module structure was not provided, it is assumed that 'which' is another module being used in the 'no_command.py' module. However, the actual implementation may vary.
