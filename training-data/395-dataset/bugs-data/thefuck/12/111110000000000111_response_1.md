The potential error in the provided code is the use of @sudo_support decorator, which seems to be intended for handling sudo permissions in the command execution. However, the decorator is not defined in the code snippet, so it is causing a syntax error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the missing definition of the sudo_support decorator in the code.

To fix the bug, the sudo_support decorator needs to be defined, or if it's not necessary for the function, it should be removed from the code.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
