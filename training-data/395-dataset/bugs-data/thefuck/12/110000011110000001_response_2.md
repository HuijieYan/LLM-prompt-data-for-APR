The error message seems to indicate that there is an issue with the attribute 'which' in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module. The 'which' attribute does not appear to be present in the 'rules.no_command' module.

The bug in the function 'match(command)' is likely due to the missing 'sudo_support' decorator. This decorator is probably assumed to be present, and without it, the function could fail to execute properly.

To fix this bug:
1. The missing 'sudo_support' decorator should be added to the 'match' function definition.
2. Ensure that the 'which' attribute is available in the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module.

```python
# Fixed function
def sudo_support(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Add sudo support logic here
        pass
    return wrapper

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
