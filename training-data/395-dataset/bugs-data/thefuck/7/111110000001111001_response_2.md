The buggy function is attempting to check if the command script contains the string "php -s". However, the buggy function is decorated with `@for_app('php')` which suggests that it may be intended to be used with a specific type of application.

Based on the expected input and output, it seems that the function is intended to check if the script starts with "php -s" rather than checking if it simply contains it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('php -s')
```

By removing the `@for_app('php')` decorator and updating the function to use `startswith` method on the `command.script`, the function will now accurately check if the script starts with "php -s" as intended.
