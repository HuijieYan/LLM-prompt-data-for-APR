The buggy function `match` is meant to check if the command contains the string "php -s". However, the function is written to check if "php -s" is present anywhere in the command instead of just at the beginning.

The error message from the test function shows that the buggy match function returns False when it should return True.

To fix the bug, I will update the function to use the `startswith` method to check if the command starts with "php -s". This will ensure that it only matches commands that begin with "php -s".

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('php -s')
```

With this change, the `match` function should now correctly identify whether the command starts with "php -s" or not. This should resolve the issue observed in the test case, and the error message from the test function should no longer occur.
