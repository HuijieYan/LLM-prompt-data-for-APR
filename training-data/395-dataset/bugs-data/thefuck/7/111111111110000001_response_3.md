The potential error location is within the match function. The current implementation checks if the exact string "php -s" is present in the command.script, which is incorrect. It should instead check if "php -s" is present as a substring in the command.script.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation is using the "in" keyword to check for an exact string match, which is causing the mismatch for the test case 'Command('php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080', '')'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the match function to check if "php -s" is a substring of the command.script.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this corrected implementation, the match function will correctly check if "php -s" is a substring of the command.script, which will resolve the issue highlighted in the test case.
