The error lies in the `match` function. The `match` function is checking if the exact string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`. However, the input commands provided in the test cases contain additional parameters like "localhost:8000" and "0.0.0.0:8080". So, the current implementation of the `match` function will not return `True` for these input commands.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if "php -s" is a substring of the `command.script` instead of an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this change, the `match` function will return `True` for both input test cases, and the error in the test will be resolved.
