The potential error location within the function is the way the match function is checking for the presence of "php -s" in the command.script.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the match function is simply checking if "php -s" is present in the entire command.script string, which will not work as intended for the given input.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the match function to check if "php -s" is present at the beginning of the command.script string.

The corrected code for the match function is as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('php -s')
```

This modification will ensure that the match function correctly identifies if the command starts with "php -s", which is the intended behavior.
