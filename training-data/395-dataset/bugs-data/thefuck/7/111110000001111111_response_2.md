The buggy function is a decorator function that is meant to be used with the `match` function to check if the input command contains the string "php -s". However, the decorator function `@for_app('php')` is not defined in the provided code, and it is unclear how it should be implemented.

Based on the context, it seems like the intent is to create a function that checks if the input command contains the string "php -s". This can be achieved by directly modifying the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly check if the input script contains the string "php -s" and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

If the intention was to use a decorator function `@for_app('php')` in conjunction with the `match` function, then the `@for_app` decorator should be properly implemented. However, in the given context, it seems unnecessary, so the suggested approach is to remove it and use the corrected `match` function as provided.
