The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the string "php -s". However, the problem is that the function checks for an exact match, so if the command script contains additional parameters, the function will return False.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the match function to check if "php -s" is present anywhere in the command script.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this change, the `match` function will now return True even if the command script contains additional parameters.

The test case should now pass without any errors.
