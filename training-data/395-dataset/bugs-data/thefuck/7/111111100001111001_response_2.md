The buggy function is trying to check if the command script contains the string "php -s", but it's not doing it correctly. It's using the `in` operator to check for a substring match, but it's not actually checking for the exact string "php -s".

The bug occurs because the function is not accurately checking for the exact string "php -s" in the command script.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to accurately check for the exact string "php -s". We can use the `==` operator to compare the strings.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script == "php -s"
```

With this correction, the function will accurately check if the command script is "php -s" and return True if it is, and False otherwise.
