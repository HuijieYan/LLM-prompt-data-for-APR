The potential error in the provided function is that the decorator "@for_app('php')" indicates that the function is intended to be used for PHP applications only. However, the implementation of the "match" function does not seem to be related to PHP specifically.

The bug in the function is that it checks for the presence of the string "php -s" in the command.script, but it should instead be checking if the command is related to PHP.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check if the command is related to PHP in general, rather than checking for a specific string.

Here's the corrected code for the "match" function:

```python
# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php") # Checking if the command starts with "php"
```

In the corrected code, the function checks if the command starts with "php", indicating that it is related to PHP. This aligns with the intention of the decorator "@for_app('php')", which specifies that the function is intended for PHP applications.
