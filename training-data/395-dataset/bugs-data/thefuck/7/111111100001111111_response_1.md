The buggy function is designed to check if the command contains the string "php -s". However, the current implementation is flawed because it checks for an exact match of "php -s", which may not be the case in all scenarios. 

The error occurs because the function is using the "in" keyword to check for an exact match, but it should be checking if "php -s" is present anywhere in the command.

To fix this, we can use the `command` parameter to access the `script` attribute and check if "php -s" is present anywhere within it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
