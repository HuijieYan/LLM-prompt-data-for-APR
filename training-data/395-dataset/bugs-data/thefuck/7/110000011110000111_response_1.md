The error occurs because the `match` function is checking if the string "php -s" is present in the command's script attribute. However, in the test case, the command's script attribute does not exactly match "php -s" causing the function to return False.

To fix this issue, the `match` function should check for the presence of "php -s" as a substring in the command's script attribute, rather than exact match.

The correct code for the `match` function should be:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
