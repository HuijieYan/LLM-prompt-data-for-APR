The buggy function is attempting to check if the command script contains the string "php -s", but it is not doing so correctly.

The bug occurs because the buggy function is using an incorrect syntax to check if "php -s" is in the command script. The correct syntax for checking if a substring is in a string is with the `in` keyword.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the syntax used to check if "php -s" is in the command script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check if "php -s" is in the command script and return the expected result.
