The buggy function is a Python function decorated with @for_app('php'). It takes a command as input and checks if the command script contains the string "php -s". 

The potential error in the function is the use of the `in` operator to check for an exact match of the command script. This can cause issues as it will return `True` for any command script containing "php -s", even if it is a part of a larger command.

To fix the bug, we can use the `==` operator to check for an exact match of the command script with "php -s".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script == "php -s"
```
