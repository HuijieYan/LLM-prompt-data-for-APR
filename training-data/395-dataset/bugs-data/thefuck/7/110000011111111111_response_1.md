The problematic function `match` is supposed to check if the command contains the string "php -s", in which case it should return True. However, the current implementation checks if the exact string "php -s" is present in the command, which does not match the test cases provided.

The error message from the test function indicates that the `match` function returned False when it was expected to return True.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should be modified to correctly check if "php -s" is present in the command string. This can be achieved by using the Python `in` keyword to check for substring existence.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly check if the string "php -s" is present in the command and return True if it is found.
