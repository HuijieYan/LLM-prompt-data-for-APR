The buggy function `match` is checking if the string "php -s" is in the `command.script` instead of checking if it's an exact match. This causes the function to return `False` when the script contains additional parameters.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if the `command.script` is exactly equal to "php -s".

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.strip() == "php -s"
```

This correction ensures that the function returns `True` only when the script is exactly "php -s", and `False` otherwise.
