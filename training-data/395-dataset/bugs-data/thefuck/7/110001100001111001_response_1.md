The buggy function is supposed to check if the input command contains the substring "php -s". However, the current implementation is checking if "php -s" is an exact match for the entire command script, rather than just a substring.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the match function to check if "php -s" is present anywhere in the command script, rather than an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this change, the function will now correctly check if the input command contains the substring "php -s", as intended.
