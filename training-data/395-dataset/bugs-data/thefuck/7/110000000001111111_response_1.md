Potential error location: The buggy function is using the `@for_app('php')` decorator, which seems to be incorrectly used. The function is trying to check if the command script contains the string "php -s", but it's not considering the entire command.script value.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function is not correctly checking the entire command.script value for the presence of "php -s". It is only checking for an exact match, which is causing the bug.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the `@for_app('php')` decorator and modify the function to properly check if "php -s" is contained within the command.script value. This can be achieved using the `in` keyword to check for substring presence.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
