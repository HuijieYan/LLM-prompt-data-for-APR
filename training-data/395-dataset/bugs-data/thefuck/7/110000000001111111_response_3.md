The buggy function is intended to check if the command script contains the substring "php -s". However, the implementation is incorrect and does not achieve this functionality.

The potential error location is within the line "return "php -s" in command.script"

The bug occurs because the implementation is using the "in" keyword to check for a substring match, but the actual command.script value contains additional information (such as the host and port). Therefore, the substring "php -s" may not match exactly within the command.script.

To fix this bug, we should use the "in" keyword to perform a substring match on the command.script value, rather than checking for an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

This corrected code will now correctly check if the substring "php -s" is present in the command.script value, regardless of the additional information within the value.
