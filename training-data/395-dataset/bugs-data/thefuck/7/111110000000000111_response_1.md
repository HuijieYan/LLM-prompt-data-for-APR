Potential error location: The error is occurring in the match function, particularly in the condition "php -s" in command.script.

Reasons behind the bug: The current implementation is checking if the string "php -s" is present in the command.script, which may not be the correct way to determine if the command is for running a PHP script.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can modify the function to check if the command starts with "php -s" instead of checking for its presence in the script.

Corrected code:
```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```
