Potential Error Location: The conditional statement `return "php -s" in command.script` is checking if the string "php -s" is present in the command script, which may not be the correct way to match the command.

Reasons for the Bug:
The buggy function is not correctly checking if the command script includes "php -s". It should instead be checking if the command script starts with "php -s".

Possible Fix:
We need to use the `startswith` method to check if the command script starts with "php -s".

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```
