1. The test case is checking the `match` function with two different commands. The error message indicates that the `match` function is returning False when it should return True.

2. The potential error location within the `match` function is the conditional statement `return "php -s" in command.script`. 

3. The occurrence of the bug is due to the use of the `in` operator to check the presence of a substring within the `command.script`. The `in` operator does not account for the exact match of the substring and can return unexpected results.

4. To fix the bug, consider using an exact string match instead of the `in` operator. This can be achieved by splitting the `command.script` using whitespace as a delimiter and then checking if the exact command `"php -s"` is present in the split tokens.

5. Corrected code:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script.split()
```
