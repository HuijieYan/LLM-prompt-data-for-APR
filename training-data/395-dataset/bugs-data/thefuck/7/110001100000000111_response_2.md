Potential Error location: The "match" function is currently incorrectly checking if the string "php -s" is in the entire command script, rather than just at the start of the command.

Reason for the Bug: The current code is checking for "php -s" anywhere in the command script, which may lead to false positives if "php -s" is part of a larger command.

Possible approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to update the "match" function to check if the command script starts with "php -s" rather than just contains it.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```
