Potential error location:
The return statement is checking if "php -s" is in the command.script, but it seems like the intention is to check if the command starts with "php -s".

Reason behind the bug:
The current condition is checking for the presence of "php -s" anywhere in the command, which may not be the desired behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Update the return statement to check if the command starts with "php -s" instead of just containing it.

Corrected code:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```
