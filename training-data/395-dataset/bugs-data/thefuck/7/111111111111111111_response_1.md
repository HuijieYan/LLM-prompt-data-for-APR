The potential error is within the "match" function. The function is currently checking if the exact string "php -s" is present in the command script, which is not accurate because the input may contain additional parameters like "localhost:8000" or "0.0.0.0:8080".

The reason behind the bug is that the "match" function is checking for an exact match of "php -s" in the command script, but the input strings contain additional parameters.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the "match" function to use a more robust approach to check if "php -s" is present in the command script.

Here's the corrected code for the "match" function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script.split(' ')
```

By using the "split(' ')" method, we can check if "php -s" appears as a command and parameter combination in the script, regardless of the additional parameters. This will ensure that the function accurately identifies whether the input command includes "php -s".
