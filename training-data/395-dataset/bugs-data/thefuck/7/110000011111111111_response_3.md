The buggy function `match` checks whether the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script` string. However, the actual intention seems to be checking if the entire `command.script` is equal to "php -s". 

The error message suggests that for the input `Command('php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080', '')`, the function returned `False` when it was expected to return `True`.

To fix the bug, the function should compare the entire `command.script` with "php -s" instead of checking for its presence within the `command.script`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command):
    return command.script == "php -s"
```

With this change, the function will correctly return `True` if `command.script` is exactly "php -s" and `False` otherwise.
