Potential error location:
The "match" function is checking if the string "php -s" is present in the entire command.script. This will not correctly check if the command is "php -s" as it will also match if "php -s" is a part of another command.

Reason for occurrence of the bug:
The function is not correctly checking if the command matches "php -s".

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Check if the entire command is "php -s" rather than checking if "php -s" is just present in the command.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# this is the corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script == "php -s"
```
