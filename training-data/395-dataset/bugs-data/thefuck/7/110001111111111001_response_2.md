The potential error location within the problematic function is the `match` function. The bug in the function is that it is checking for the exact string "php -s" within the command.script, which may not always be present due to the addition of host and port. This causes the function to return False for the second test case.

To fix this bug, the `match` function should be modified to check if "php -s" is present in the command.script instead of an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this modification, the function will correctly check if "php -s" is present in the command.script, regardless of the presence of additional host and port information. This will ensure that the function returns True for both test cases.
