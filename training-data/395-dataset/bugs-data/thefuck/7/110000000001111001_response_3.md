The buggy function is a decorator that is intended to check if the command contains the string "php -s". However, the code provided is not a valid decorator syntax in Python, and it doesn't actually implement the intended logic.

The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect syntax for the decorator, as well as the incorrect logic inside the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect usage of the decorator syntax and the incorrect logic inside the function. The function is not checking the command correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the "@for_app('php')" decorator and instead define a regular function that takes the `command` as an argument, then check if "php -s" is present in the `command.script`.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`, and it should work as intended in the provided test cases.
