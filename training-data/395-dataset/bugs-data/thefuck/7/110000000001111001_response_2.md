The buggy function "match" is supposed to check if the command passed in has the substring "php -s" in its script. However, the implementation doesn't match the expected behavior.

The potential error in the code is the way the function is checking for the substring "php -s" in the command script. The current implementation is using the `in` keyword to check for an exact match of "php -s", which does not meet the expected functionality.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to check for the substring "php -s" in the command script. We will use the `command.script.startswith("php -s")` to check if the script starts with "php -s".

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```
