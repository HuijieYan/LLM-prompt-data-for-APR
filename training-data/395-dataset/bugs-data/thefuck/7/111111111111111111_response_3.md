The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command contains "php -s" in its script. However, the current implementation checks if the entire string "php -s" is present in the command's script, which is causing the issue. 

The error message from the test function indicates that the `match` function returned `False` when it was expected to return `True`.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should use the `in` keyword to check if "php -s" is present anywhere in the command's script, not just as an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this fix, the `match` function will correctly check if the command's script contains "php -s" anywhere, as expected.
