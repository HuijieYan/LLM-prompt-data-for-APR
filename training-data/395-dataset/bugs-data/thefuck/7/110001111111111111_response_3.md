The bug is located in the `match` function. The current implementation uses the `in` keyword to check if the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`. However, this approach is flawed because it will return true for any command that contains "php -s" as a substring, which is not the intended behavior.

The bug occurs because the current implementation does not accurately match the command script. It only checks for a partial match, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to accurately match the command script with the string "php -s". We should compare the entire command script with "php -s" to ensure an accurate match.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.strip() == 'php -s'
```

With this correction, the `match` function will properly match the command script with the string "php -s" and return the expected boolean value. This should resolve the issue in the test case.
