The buggy function is a Python function designed to match a particular command. The function is intended to return True if the command contains the string "php -s", otherwise it should return False.

The bug in the function is that it is using the `in` keyword to check if the exact string "php -s" is present in the command script. However, the command script might include additional parameters such as the host and port, which would cause the function to return False even if "php -s" is present in the command.

To fix the bug, we should use a different approach to check for the presence of "php -s" within the command script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script.split()
```

With this change, the function will split the command script into a list of words and then check if "php -s" is present in that list. This approach will correctly identify the presence of "php -s" within the command script, regardless of any additional parameters.
