Potential error location: The conditional statement in the match function is checking if the string "php -s" is present in the entire command.script, which is not the correct approach.

Reasons behind the bug: The match function is incorrectly checking for the presence of "php -s" in the entire command.script, instead of just the first word in the script.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We should check if the first word of the script is "php" and the second word is "-s" to accurately determine if the command is "php -s".

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.split()[0] == "php" and command.script.split()[1] == "-s"
```
