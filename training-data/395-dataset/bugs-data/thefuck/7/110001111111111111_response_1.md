The `match` function is supposed to check whether the command has "php -s" in it. However, the current implementation checks for the exact string "php -s", which is not what is required.

The potential error location is the `return "php -s" in command.script` line in the `match` function.

The bug occurred because the `match` function is checking for the exact string "php -s" in the `command.script`, without considering any additional parameters or variations.

To fix the bug, we need to check if "php -s" is present in the `command.script` string. We can achieve this using the `in` operator, which checks for the presence of a substring.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this change, the `match` function will correctly check for the presence of "php -s" in the `command.script` string, and the test should pass successfully.
