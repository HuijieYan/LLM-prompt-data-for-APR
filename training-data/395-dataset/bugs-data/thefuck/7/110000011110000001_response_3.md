The error occurs because the buggy function `match` is not correctly checking if the string "php -s" is in the command.script. The current implementation only checks if "php -s" is exactly equal to the command.script, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, the function should use the `in` operator to check if "php -s" is a substring of the command.script.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if "php -s" is contained within the command.script and return the expected result for the given test cases.
