The bug is located in the `match` function where it checks if "php -s" is in the command script. The bug is causing the test to fail as it returns False when it should be returning True for the given commands.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The `match` function is incorrectly checking for the presence of "php -s" in the command script.
2. It is not considering the additional arguments like '-t pub' or the IP and port numbers in the script.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should be modified to check if "php -s" is present in the command script, and not as part of a larger string. Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Corrected match function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly check if the command script starts with "php -s" and return True if it does, which will pass the provided test cases.
