The buggy function `match` checks if the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`. However, the buggy function does not handle the scenarios where additional characters or parameters are present after "php -s".

The error message from the test function indicates that the `match` function returned False for the test case `Command('php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080', '')`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to properly check if "php -s" is present at the beginning of the `command.script` and followed by a space or the end of the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s ") or command.script == "php -s"
```

This correction checks if the `command.script` starts with "php -s " or if the `command.script` is exactly "php -s", which properly handles the scenarios where additional characters or parameters are present after "php -s".
