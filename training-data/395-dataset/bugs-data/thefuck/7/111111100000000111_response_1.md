Potential error location: The "match" function is returning whether the entire command has "php -s" in it, which may not be the desired behavior.

Reason for the bug: The function is checking for the presence of "php -s" in the entire command script, rather than just the executable part.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We should only check if "php -s" is present at the beginning of the command script, indicating that the user wants to run the PHP built-in web server.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```
