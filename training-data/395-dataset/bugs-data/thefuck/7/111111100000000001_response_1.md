Potential error location: The `match` function is not correctly checking if the command contains "php -s".

Reason for bug: The `match` function is currently checking for the exact string "php -s" in the command, instead of checking if "php -s" is present anywhere in the command.

Approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `match` function to check if "php -s" is present anywhere in the command, instead of checking for an exact match.

Corrected code:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

Corrected explanation:
The corrected code simply checks if the command contains "php -s" anywhere in the script. This addresses the bug in the original code where an exact match was being checked.
