The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command contains "php -s". However, the implementation is incorrect as it only checks if "php -s" is identical to the entire command script.

The error message from the test function indicates that the match function returns False for the Command('php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080', ''). This is incorrect because "php -s" is present in the command script.

To fix this bug, the function needs to use string matching to check if "php -s" is present in the command script rather than an exact match. This can be accomplished using the `in` keyword to check for substrings.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if "php -s" is present anywhere within the command script, and the test should pass without errors.
