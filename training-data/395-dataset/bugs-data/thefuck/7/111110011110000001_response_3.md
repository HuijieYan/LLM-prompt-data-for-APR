The potential error in the buggy function is the use of the `@for_app('php')` decorator, which may not be correctly implemented. This decorator is likely intended to register the `match` function as a rule for the 'php' app, but it is not a valid Python syntax. This is likely causing the test failures when the `match` function is not behaving as expected.

To fix the bug, the `@for_app('php')` decorator should be removed and the `match` function should be refactored to correctly determine if the command is invoking PHP with the `-s` flag.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the `match` function correctly checks if the command invokes PHP with the `-s` flag, and the test case should pass without errors.
