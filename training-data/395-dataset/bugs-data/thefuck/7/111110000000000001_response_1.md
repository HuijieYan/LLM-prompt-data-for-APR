Potential error: The function is using a decorator @for_app('php'), but 'for_app' is not defined and it seems to be intended as a decorator to specify that the function should only run for PHP applications.

Reason for the bug: The 'for_app' decorator is not defined, so the function is not behaving as intended.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define the 'for_app' decorator to specify that the function should only run for PHP applications.

Corrected code:

```python
# define the for_app decorator
def for_app(app_name):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(command):
            if command.app_name == app_name:
                return func(command)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# use the for_app decorator to specify that the match function should only run for PHP applications
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
In this corrected code, the for_app decorator is defined to allow the match function to only run for PHP applications. The decorator checks if the command's app_name matches the specified app_name, and if so, it runs the match function.
