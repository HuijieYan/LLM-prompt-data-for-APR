The error occurs because the `match` function always returns False. This is because the `return "php -s" in command.script` will only return True if the exact string "php -s" is present in `command.script`. 

To fix this, we need to modify the function to check if "php -s" is a substring of `command.script` instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the function will return True if "php -s" is present anywhere in the `command.script`, addressing the issue of the previous function always returning False.
