# Potential error location
The potential error is in the `match` function where it is checking if the command contains "php -s".

# Reasons behind the bug
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking if the command contains "php -s". The logic used for checking the command is incorrect.

# Possible approaches for fixing the bug
The correct approach is to check if "php -s" is in the command provided, rather than checking if the entire command is "php -s".

# Corrected code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
