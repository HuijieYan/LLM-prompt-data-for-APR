The potential error in the provided function is that the decorator `@for_app('php')` is not defined in the code snippet. This could be the reason for the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `for_app` decorator and modify the `match` function to work as intended.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Define the for_app decorator
def for_app(app):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(command):
            if app in command.script:
                return func(command)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Fix the match function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

In this corrected code, we have defined the `for_app` decorator and used it to decorate the `match` function. The `match` function now checks if the command script contains "php -s" and returns the result accordingly.
