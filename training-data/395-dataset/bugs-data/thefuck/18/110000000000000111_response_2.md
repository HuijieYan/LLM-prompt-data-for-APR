Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is the comparison of the patterns with the command's stderr and stdout. It appears that the 'command' variable is not defined within the function, so this comparison will always fail.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The 'command' variable is not defined within the function, so the comparison with its stderr and stdout will always return False. This leads to incorrect results when using the match function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Pass the 'command' variable as an argument to the match function when it is called.
2. Ensure that the 'command' variable is defined and contains the stderr and stdout attributes.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In the corrected code, the 'command' variable and 'patterns' are passed as arguments to the match function. This ensures that the function has access to the command's stderr and stdout, and can perform the pattern matching correctly.
