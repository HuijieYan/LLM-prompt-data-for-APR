The test case and associated issue suggest that the function is used to match patterns in the error message and command output. The current function has a bug where it is not handling "sudo" command properly and returning True for a match when it shouldn't.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition where it checks if the pattern is present in the error message or command output. The current logic doesn't handle the "sudo" command properly.

The bug occurs because the function does not distinguish between the actual command output/error and the "sudo" appended to it. This causes the function to incorrectly match the patterns in the error message/command output.

To fix the bug, the function should check for patterns in the actual command output/error without considering the "sudo" command. This can be achieved by modifying the conditions to exclude the "sudo" part of the command.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
