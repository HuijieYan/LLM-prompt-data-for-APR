The error is occurring because the `patterns` variable is not defined in the `match` function. It seems that `patterns` is intended to be a list of patterns to match against the command's stdout and stderr.

To fix this bug, the patterns list should be passed as a parameter to the `match` function. The `match` function should then iterate over the patterns list and check if any of the patterns are present in the command's stderr or stdout.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

This corrected function takes an additional `patterns` parameter, which is the list of patterns to match against the command's stdout and stderr.

The test function can then be updated to pass the `patterns` list as a parameter to the `match` function. For example:

```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command(), ['eDSPermissionError'])
    assert not match(Command(script='sudo ls', stderr='Permission denied'), ['permission denied'])
``` 

With these changes, the function should work as expected and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
