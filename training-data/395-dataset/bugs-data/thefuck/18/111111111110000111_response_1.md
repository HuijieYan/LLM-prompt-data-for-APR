The test case is checking if the `match` function does not return True when given a Command object. It then asserts this by giving a Command object with the script as 'sudo ls' and stderr as 'Permission denied'. The error message shows that the function returns True when it's expected to return False.

The potential error location within the `match` function is the logic inside the for loop that iterates over the `patterns`. The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the case where `patterns` is empty.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `patterns` is not empty before entering the for loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    if not patterns:
        return False
        
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In the corrected code, the `patterns` argument is added to the function parameters, and a check is added at the beginning of the function to return False if `patterns` is empty. This ensures that the function will not throw an error when `patterns` is empty and will return False as expected.
