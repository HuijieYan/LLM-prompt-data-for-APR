Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the `match` function where it looks for the patterns in the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`.

Reasons: The `match` function is not properly handling cases where the "sudo" command is already present in the `command.stdout` or `command.stderr`. This results in the function returning `True` when it shouldn't.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Modify the function to check if the "sudo" command is already present in `command.stderr` or `command.stdout`.
2. Properly handle cases where "sudo" is already present in the output.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() and "sudo" not in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower() and "sudo" not in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
