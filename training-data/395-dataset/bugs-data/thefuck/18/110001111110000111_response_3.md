The test case is checking if the `match` function correctly returns False for a `Command` object with a script of 'sudo ls' and a stderr of 'Permission denied'. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not match(Command(script='sudo ls', stderr='Permission denied'))` failed because it actually returned True, meaning the `match` function incorrectly matched the pattern.

The potential error location within the `match` function is the `if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\` line. It is likely that the `command.stderr` is not returning the expected value or format, causing the pattern matching to fail.

The bug likely occurs because the `command.stderr` is not in the expected format or does not contain the expected text. This could be due to differences in the way the `Command` object is being constructed or differences in the structure of the command's output.

To fix the bug, we can check the structure of the `Command` object and ensure that the `command.stderr` is being set correctly. Additionally, we can validate the expected format of the `command.stderr` and handle cases where it might not match the expected format.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_18/thefuck/rules/sudo.py

def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With these changes, the `match` function should now correctly match patterns in the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`, addressing the bug and resolving the issue with the test case.
