The error in the function `match` is occurring due to the use of the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` attributes. These attributes are not defined in the `Command` class, which is causing the AttributeError. Additionally, the function relies on the `patterns` variable, which is not defined within the function.

To fix the bug in the `match` function, we need to make the following adjustments:
1. Define the `patterns` variable within the `match` function or pass it as a parameter.
2. Use the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` attributes correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() \
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

By making these changes, the `match` function will work as expected, and the associated test cases should pass without any error.
