The issue seems to be with the `match` function, which is supposed to check if any of the patterns in the `patterns` list are present in the `stderr` or `stdout` of the `command`. 

In the given buggy function, the issue is with the comparison of the patterns with the `stderr` and `stdout`. The comparison is case insensitive, which means that the pattern is being converted to lowercase for comparison. However, in the test cases provided, the patterns are in different cases than the `stderr` and `stdout`. This results in mismatched comparisons and incorrect return values.

To fix the issue, the comparison should consider the original case of the patterns and the `stderr` and `stdout`.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to convert the `stderr` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, along with the patterns in the `patterns` list. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive while also preserving the original case of the patterns and the `stderr` and `stdout`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

By converting both the patterns and the `stderr` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now produce the expected results in the given test cases.
