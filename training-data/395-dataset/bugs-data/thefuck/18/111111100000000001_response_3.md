The potential error in this function is that 'patterns' is not defined within the scope of this function. It seems like 'patterns' should be a list of strings that the function checks for in the command's standard error and standard output.

The bug occurs because 'patterns' is not defined within the scope of the function. To fix this, the 'patterns' variable needs to be defined or passed as an argument to the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
