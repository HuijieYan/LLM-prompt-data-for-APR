The error in the provided code lies within the `match` function. The function is searching for patterns in the command's stderr and stdout, and if found, it returns True. However, the patterns are not defined within the function, and the case sensitivity is not handled properly.

The error in the test function `test_not_match` is due to the incorrect behavior of the `match` function for the second test case.

To fix the bug:
1. We should define the `patterns` variable within the `match` function and ensure it is case insensitive.
2. We need to handle the case when the `patterns` list is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    patterns = ['eDSPermissionError', 'permission denied']  # define patterns
    if not patterns:  # handle the case when patterns list is empty
        return False
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With these changes, the `match` function should work correctly for the provided test cases and handle the defined patterns.
