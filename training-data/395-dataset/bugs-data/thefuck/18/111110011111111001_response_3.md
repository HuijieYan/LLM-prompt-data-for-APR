The bug in the `match` function is causing the test case `test_not_match()` to fail. The function is expected to return `False` when the patterns in the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` do not match any of the patterns in the `patterns` list. However, the function is not behaving as expected.

The potential error is in the comparison part of the if condition in the `match` function. The comparison is checking if the lowercase version of the pattern is in the lowercase version of `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`. However, the lowercase version of the pattern should be checked against the lowercase version of the `stderr` and `stdout`.

The bug occurs because the function is checking the lowercase version of the pattern against the lowercase version of the entire `stderr` and `stdout`, instead of checking if the lowercase version of the pattern is present within the `stderr` and `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the comparison part of the if condition to check if the lowercase version of the pattern is present within the lowercase version of `stderr` and `stdout`.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the `match` function should now work as expected, and the `test_not_match` test case should pass successfully.
