Potential error location: The error in the function lies in the usage of 'patterns' without initializing it in the function.

Reasons for the bug: The 'patterns' variable is being used in the function without being defined within the function scope, leading to a NameError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Initialize the 'patterns' variable within the function, or pass it as an argument to the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() \
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
