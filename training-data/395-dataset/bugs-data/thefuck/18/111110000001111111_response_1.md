The bug in the `match` function is that it is using the `stderr` and `stdout` attributes of the `command` object without checking if they are `None` or not. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access these attributes when they are `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` are not `None`, and then perform the `lower` comparison.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    if command.stderr is not None and command.stdout is not None:
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
                return True
    return False
```

This change ensures that the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` are not `None` before performing the comparison, preventing the AttributeError.
