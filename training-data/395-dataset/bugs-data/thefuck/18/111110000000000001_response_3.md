The potential error in the given function is with the `patterns` variable. It appears that the `patterns` variable is being used within the `match` function but has not been defined within the function itself. 

To fix this issue, the `patterns` variable should be passed as an argument to the `match` function so that it can be used within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

By passing the `patterns` as an argument to the `match` function, the issue of the undefined variable is resolved. Now the function can effectively check if any of the patterns are present in the command's stderr or stdout, and return True if a match is found, and False otherwise.
