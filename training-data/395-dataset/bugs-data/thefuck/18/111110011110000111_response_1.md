The error is occurring because the `match` function is using a variable `patterns` that is not defined within the function. This is likely the cause of the `AssertionError` in the test function `test_not_match`.

The function `match` is expecting `patterns` as an input, but it is not provided. It seems that `patterns` is supposed to be a list of strings that the function should match against the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`.

To fix the bug, the `patterns` input should be added as a parameter to the `match` function. Additionally, it seems that `command` is supposed to be an object of a `Command` class, so we need a definition for the `Command` class as well.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
class Command:
    def __init__(self, script='', stdout='', stderr=''):
        self.script = script
        self.stdout = stdout
        self.stderr = stderr

def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In this corrected version, the `Command` class is defined with the necessary attributes (`script`, `stdout`, `stderr`), and the `match` function takes two parameters: `command` and `patterns`.

Assuming that `patterns` is defined properly in the test cases, this should resolve the issue.
