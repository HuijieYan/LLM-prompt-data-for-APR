The test case `test_not_match` asserts the output of the `match` function when provided with different `Command` objects. The error message indicates that the `match` function returned `True` when it should have returned `False` for the given `Command` object.

Upon analyzing the `match` function, the potential error location seems to be in the comparison of strings in the `if` condition. The error occurs because `patterns` is not defined within the `match` function, and it might be a global variable or imported from a different module.

To fix the bug, the `patterns` variable needs to be defined or imported within the `match` function. Once the correct `patterns` variable is accessible within the `match` function, the comparison can be performed without any issues.

The corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the `patterns` variable is passed as an argument to the `match` function, making it accessible and ensuring that the comparison is performed correctly.
