The issue is with the `match` function. The `patterns` variable is not defined, and it is being used within the function.

The `match` function is attempting to iterate through `patterns` without having it defined anywhere. This is causing the function to throw an error.

To fix this, the `patterns` variable needs to be defined somewhere in the code or passed into the `match` function as a parameter.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

Now the `patterns` variable is a parameter of the `match` function, and it needs to be passed when calling the function.

Example usage:

```python
patterns = ['error', 'warning']
command = Command(script='sudo ls', stderr='Permission denied', stdout='')
result = match(command, patterns)
print(result)  # True or False
```
