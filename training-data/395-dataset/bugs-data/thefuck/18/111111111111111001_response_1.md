The issue with the `match` function is that it is using an undeclared variable `patterns` which is not defined or inputted anywhere in the function. This is causing the function to throw an error and not returning the expected output. 

To fix this issue, the `patterns` variable needs to be defined either as a parameter to the `match` function or as a global variable.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

Alternatively, if `patterns` is a global variable, the function can be rewritten as:

```python
patterns = []  # define the global variable

def match(command):
    global patterns  # use the global variable

    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With these changes, the `patterns` variable is defined and passed into the function, ensuring that the function can run without errors.
