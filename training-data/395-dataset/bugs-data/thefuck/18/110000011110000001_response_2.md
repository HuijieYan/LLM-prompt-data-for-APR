The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` with the `pattern`. The issue seems to be that `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` could be `None`, and when casefolded in the `if` condition, it would raise an AttributeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not check if `command.stderr` or `command.stdout` are `None` before attempting to casefold them.

To fix the bug, we can modify the if condition to explicitly check if `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` are not `None` before trying to casefold them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if command.stderr and pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or command.stdout and pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
