The issue with the function is that it is trying to access the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` attributes without checking if they exist. This causes an AttributeError when the stderr or stdout are empty.

To fix this, we need to add checks to see if `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` exist before trying to access them.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if command.stderr and pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or command.stdout and pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
