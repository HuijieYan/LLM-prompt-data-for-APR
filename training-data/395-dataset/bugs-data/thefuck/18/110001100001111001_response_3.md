The buggy function is supposed to check if a pattern is present in the command's stderr or stdout. However, the function is not correctly handling the case when either stderr or stdout is empty. This results in an error when trying to convert an empty value to lowercase. 

To fix this bug, we need to add condition checks to handle the cases where stderr or stdout are empty. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if command.stderr and pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower():
            return True
        if command.stdout and pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the stderr or stdout is not empty before trying to access it. This ensures that we won't encounter an error when using the `lower()` method. Now the function will correctly handle cases where stderr or stdout is empty.
