The buggy function is trying to match patterns in the command's stderr or stdout to identify if an error has occurred. The issue seems to be related to not finding the expected pattern, possibly due to case sensitivity.

In Buggy case 1, the pattern 'eDSPermissionError' is not found because of a case mismatch. In Buggy case 2, the pattern 'permission denied' is also not found due to a case mismatch.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the patterns with the command's stderr and stdout should not be case-sensitive. Both the patterns and the command's output should be converted to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
