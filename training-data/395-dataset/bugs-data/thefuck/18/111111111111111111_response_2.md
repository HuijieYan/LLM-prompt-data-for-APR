The bug occurs due to the comparison of the patterns with the error message in a case-sensitive manner. In the first buggy case, the pattern "eDSPermissionError" doesn't match the lowercase version of the command's stderr, which is an empty string. In the second buggy case, the pattern "eDSPermissionError" doesn't match the lowercase version of the command's stderr, which is "Permission denied".

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the patterns and the error messages is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the patterns and the error messages to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

By converting both the patterns and the error messages to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the matching is case-insensitive, addressing the bug in the original function.
