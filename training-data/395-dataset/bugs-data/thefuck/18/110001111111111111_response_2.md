The error is occurring because the `match` function is not properly handling the command input. The function tries to access `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` without checking if they exist or not. This results in an AttributeError due to the absence of these attributes in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` exist before accessing their attributes. We also need to address the pattern matching to ensure that it is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    if hasattr(command, 'stderr') and hasattr(command, 'stdout'):
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
                return True
    return False
```

With these changes, the function will properly handle cases where `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` are not available. Additionally, pattern matching will be done in a case-insensitive manner. This should address the bug and allow the function to work as expected.
