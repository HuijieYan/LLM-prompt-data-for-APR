The potential error in the provided function is the reference to 'patterns' without it being defined within the scope of the function. It seems like 'patterns' is supposed to be a list of patterns to match against the command's stderr and stdout.

The error occurs because the function is trying to iterate through 'patterns' without it being defined or passed as an argument.

To fix this, we can modify the function to take 'patterns' as an argument, ensuring that it is defined and passed when the function is called.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

By adding 'patterns' as an argument, the function will now be able to iterate through the list of patterns and check for matches in the command's stderr and stdout.
