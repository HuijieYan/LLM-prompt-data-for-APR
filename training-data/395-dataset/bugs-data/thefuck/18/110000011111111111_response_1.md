The error occurs because the function `match` is trying to access the `patterns` variable, which is not defined. Additionally, the `Command` class is not defined within the function. The function is also comparing the lowercased patterns with `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`, which may not give the expected results.

To fix the bug:
1. Define the `patterns` variable and initialize it with a list of patterns to match.
2. Define the `Command` class or import it from the appropriate module.
3. Modify the comparison to use the `lower()` method on both the patterns and the command outputs to ensure a case-insensitive match.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
patterns = ['eDSPermissionError', 'permission denied']

def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

This should address the issue and provide the expected behavior for the `match` function.
