# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_18/thefuck/rules/sudo.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Simple prepending of "sudo" is not always helps
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
user@machine:/$ mkdir /var/www
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/var/www’: Permission denied
user@machine:/$ fuck
sudo mkdir /var/www [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
root is owner of /var/www

user@machine:/$ touch /var/www/1/2/3
touch: cannot touch ‘/var/www/1/2/3’: No such file or directory
user@machine:/$ fuck
mkdir -p /var/www/1/2 && touch /var/www/1/2/3 [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
the command is ok, we have permission error

mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/var/www/1’: Permission denied
user@machine:/$ fuck
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/1/2 && touch /var/www/1/2/3 [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
touch: cannot touch ‘/var/www/1/2/3’: Permission denied
permission error related to touch, but accroding to common pattern ("sudo + command") we have double sudo

user@machine:/$ fuck
sudo sudo mkdir -p /var/www/1/2 && touch /var/www/1/2/3 [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
touch: cannot touch ‘/var/www/1/2/3’: Permission denied
```
