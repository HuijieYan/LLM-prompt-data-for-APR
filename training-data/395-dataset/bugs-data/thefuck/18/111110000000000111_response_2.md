The potential bug in the provided function is that the 'patterns' variable is not defined within the 'match' function. This will result in a NameError when the function is called.

It seems like the function is intended to check if a pattern is present in the stderr or stdout of a command.

To fix this bug, you can pass the 'patterns' variable as a parameter to the 'match' function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
