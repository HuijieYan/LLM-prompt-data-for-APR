The buggy function, `get_new_command`, is meant to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force' in the input command. However, since the input command may contain additional arguments beyond just 'push', the function needs to handle these cases as well.

The buggy function is currently not handling the additional arguments properly, as it only replaces 'push' with 'push --force' without considering any other arguments that might be present in the input command.

To fix this issue, the function needs to identify the position of 'push' in the input command and replace it with 'push --force', while preserving any additional arguments that come after 'push'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if 'push' in parts:
        push_index = parts.index('push')
        parts.insert(push_index + 1, '--force')
    return ' '.join(parts)
```

This code splits the input command by spaces and checks if the word 'push' is present. If it is, it adds '--force' after 'push' in the list of command parts and then joins the parts back together with spaces to form the new command.
