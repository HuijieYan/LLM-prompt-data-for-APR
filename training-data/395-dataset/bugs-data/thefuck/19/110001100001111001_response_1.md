The buggy function is designed to replace the argument 'push' with 'push --force'. However, it does not seem to take into account the fact that 'push' might have additional arguments after it, such as a branch name or remote name.

The bug occurs because the function only replaces 'push' with 'push --force', regardless of any additional arguments. This results in incorrect commands being generated.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle cases where 'push' is followed by additional arguments, such as branch names or remote names.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if 'push' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('push')
        script_parts.insert(index + 1, '--force')
    return ' '.join(script_parts)
```

This corrected function splits the input command into parts, checks for the presence of 'push', and then inserts '--force' after 'push' if it is present. It then reassembles the command and returns it. This approach properly handles cases where 'push' is followed by additional arguments.
