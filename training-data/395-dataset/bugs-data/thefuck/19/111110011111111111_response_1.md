The buggy function `get_new_command` accepts a `command` as input and attempts to modify the script part of the command by replacing "push" with "push --force". This implies that the function operates only on commands related to git.

The bug occurs because the input command can have additional arguments after "push" such as a branch name or a remote name. The current implementation does not account for this, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle additional arguments after "push" and include them in the output as well.

```python
# Fixed function
def get_new_command(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if "git" in parts and "push" in parts:
        if len(parts) > parts.index("push") + 1:
            parts[parts.index("push")] = 'push --force'
    return ' '.join(parts)
```

This approach splits the command into parts, checks if it is a "git push" command, and then replaces "push" with "push --force" if additional arguments are present. Finally, it joins the parts back together into a single string command.
