The buggy function is `get_new_command(command)`, which is supposed to replace the argument 'push' with 'push --force'. The function is used by `test_get_new_command` to compare the output with the expected value.

One potential error is that the function is only replacing the first occurrence of 'push' with 'push --force', which is leading to incorrect output.

The reason for the bug is that the `replace_argument` function is not used correctly. It is only replacing the first occurrence of 'push' with 'push --force' instead of replacing all occurrences.

To fix the bug, the `replace_argument` function should be used in such a way that it replaces all occurrences of 'push' with 'push --force'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
```

With this correction, all occurrences of 'push' will be replaced with 'push --force', and the test cases should pass successfully.
