Potential error location: The function is using a decorator `@git_support` which is not defined. This could potentially cause the function to fail.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The decorator `@git_support` is not defined, so when the function is called, it will result in an error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the `@git_support` decorator and directly define the `get_new_command` function.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
