The error seems to be related to the `replace_argument` function call inside the `get_new_command` function. It seems that the function is not properly replacing the 'push' argument with 'push --force' as expected.

The reason for the bug could be related to the usage of the `replace_argument` function, which might not be working as intended to replace the arguments in the command.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to directly manipulate the command string to add '--force' flag instead of using the `replace_argument` function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # add --force flag if 'push' is present in the command
    new_script = command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force')
    return new_script
```
