The buggy function is meant to replace the argument 'push' with 'push --force' in the input command. There are no apparent errors in the function's logic based on the given information.

The reason for the provided cases being considered as "buggy" is not clear. The function itself is operating as expected based on its definition.

As the function is correctly implemented based on the available information, no changes need to be made to the function. Therefore, the correct function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
