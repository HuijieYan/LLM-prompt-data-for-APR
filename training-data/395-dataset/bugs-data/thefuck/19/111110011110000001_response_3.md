The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function. The function is intended to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force' in a given input command. However, the test cases are failing because the function is replacing 'push' with 'push --force', whereas it should be replaced with 'push --force-with-lease' according to the test cases.

The potential error in the function lies in the `replace_argument` function where it replaces 'push' with 'push --force' unconditionally, which does not align with the expected behavior mentioned in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function needs to be modified to conditionally replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease' as per the test cases provided.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
    return command.script
```

This modification ensures that 'push' is replaced with 'push --force-with-lease' only if it exists in the command.script, as per the test cases.
