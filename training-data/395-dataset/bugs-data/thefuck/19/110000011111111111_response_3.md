The problem with the buggy function is that it is using a decorator `@git_support` that is not defined or provided in the code snippet. As a result, it is not clear what the `git_support` decorator is doing, and it is causing the function to not behave as expected.

The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to replace the argument 'push' with 'push --force' in the command script. However, the tests are failing with assertion errors because the output is not matching the expected value.

To fix the bug, the `@git_support` decorator should be removed and a simple function that replaces the 'push' with 'push --force' should be implemented.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
```
