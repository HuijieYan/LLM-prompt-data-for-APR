The buggy function `get_new_command` is using a decorator `@git_support` that is not defined in the code provided. Also, the `replace_argument` function is not defined.

The expected behavior of the function seems to be adding the `--force` argument to the `git push` command. However, the buggy function does not handle different variations of the `git push` command, such as when there are additional arguments after `git push`.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `@git_support` decorator and define the `replace_argument` function. Then we can use string manipulation to add the `--force` argument to the `git push` command only if it is not already present.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'git push' in command.script and '--force' not in command.script:
        return command.script + ' --force'
    else:
        return command.script
```

This code checks if the command is a `git push` and if the `--force` argument is not already present. If both conditions are met, it adds the `--force` argument to the command. Otherwise, it returns the original command.
