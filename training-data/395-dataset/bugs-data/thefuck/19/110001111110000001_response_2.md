The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to replace the argument "push" with "push --force" in a git command. The test function `test_get_new_command` is using the `get_new_command` function to test if the replacement is done correctly. The error messages indicate that the replacement is not working as expected in all test cases.

The potential error in the `get_new_command` function is with the `replace_argument` function. It seems that the `replace_argument` function is not correctly replacing the "push" argument with "push --force". This is resulting in the incorrect output in the test cases.

The bug is occurring because the `replace_argument` is performing a simple string replacement, which is not considering the context of the word "push". It is replacing all instances of "push" in the command, regardless of whether it is the exact argument "push" or part of another word.

To fix this bug, the `get_new_command` function should be modified to replace only the exact argument "push" with "push --force" in the command's script.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force')
```
