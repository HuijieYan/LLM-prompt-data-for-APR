The problem is that the function get_new_command is not handling the 'git push' command properly. The test case expects the function to replace 'git push' with 'git push --force-with-lease', but the original function is replacing it with 'git push --force'. This is causing AssertionErrors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function get_new_command should be modified to correctly replace 'git push' with 'git push --force-with-lease' as expected by the test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
```
