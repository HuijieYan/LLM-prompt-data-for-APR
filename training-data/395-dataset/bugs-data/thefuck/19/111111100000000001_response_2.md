The buggy function is utilizing the `replace_argument` method, but it is not imported and neither is it defined within the function itself. This is causing an error.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `replace_argument` method or import it from another module, depending on where it is defined.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

from some_module import replace_argument  # import replace_argument from its defined module

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
