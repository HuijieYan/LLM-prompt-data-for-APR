The buggy function `get_new_command` is a wrapper for the `replace_argument` function, but it currently has an incorrect decorator `@git_support` that should be removed. 

The reason for the bug occurring in the function is due to the incorrect use of the `@git_support` decorator, which is not a valid Python decorator. This decorator should be removed.

To fix the bug, remove the `@git_support` decorator from the `get_new_command` function signature.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
