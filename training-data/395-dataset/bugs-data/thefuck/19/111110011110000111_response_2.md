The error in the code is that the function `get_new_command` is using a decorator `@git_support`, but the implementation of that decorator is missing. As a result, it is causing assertion errors in the test cases.

The reason for the bug is that the `@git_support` decorator is not implemented or imported correctly. It seems that it should be related to enhancing the behavior of the `get_new_command` function, but without the implementation of the decorator, the function is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, you can do the following:
1. If the `@git_support` decorator is a standard decorator provided by a library or framework, make sure to import it correctly.
2. If the `@git_support` decorator is custom, implement it to enhance the behavior of the `get_new_command` function.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function without the `@git_support` decorator:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
