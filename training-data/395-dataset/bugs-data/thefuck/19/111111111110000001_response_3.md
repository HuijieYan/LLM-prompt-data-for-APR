The issue in the provided function is that 'push' is being replaced with 'push --force' in the `get_new_command` function. This is not the correct replacement, as the test cases are expecting 'push --force-with-lease'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the replacement is not accurate. It should replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease'.

To fix the bug, we need to replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease'. The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
```

With this correction, the function will replace 'git push' with 'git push --force-with-lease', as expected by the test cases.
