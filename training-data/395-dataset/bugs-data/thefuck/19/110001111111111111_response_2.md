The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to replace the argument in the given command with the string `'push --force'`. However, the current implementation simply searches for the string `'push'` and replaces it with `'push --force'`, regardless of its position in the command.

The error messages in the test functions suggest that the replacement is not done correctly. It seems that the function is replacing the entire command with `'push --force'` instead of adding `--force` to the existing `push` command.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to append `'--force'` to the argument if `push` exists in the command. 

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# Import git_support and replace_argument if not imported already

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command if 'push' is not found
```

With this modification, the `get_new_command` function will correctly append `--force` to the existing `push` command, preserving any additional arguments or options.
