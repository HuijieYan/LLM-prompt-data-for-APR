Potential Error Location: The issue lies in the usage of the `replace_argument` function.

Reasons for the Bug:
The `replace_argument` function is being used without being defined within the scope of the provided code. This is the cause of the error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `replace_argument` function within the scope of the provided code.
2. Use a built-in method or function to replace the argument in the command.script string.

Corrected Code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
```
In the corrected code, the `replace_argument` function has been replaced with the built-in `replace` method of strings to replace the 'push' argument with 'push --force' in the `command.script`.
