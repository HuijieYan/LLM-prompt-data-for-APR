The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the git command to include the `--force` option if it contains the word "push". However, the test cases are failing with assertion errors.

The potential error in the function is that it is not correctly identifying the word "push" in the command and replacing it with "push --force". Additionally, the expected output in the test cases includes the "with-lease" option, which is not being handled in the current implementation.

The main reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the different possible variations of the `git push` command correctly, and it is not adding the expected `--force-with-lease` option.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check for the exact match of `git push` and then replace it with `git push --force-with-lease`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'git push' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force-with-lease')
    return command.script
```
