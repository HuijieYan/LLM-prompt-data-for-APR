The bug occurs because the `replace_argument` function is not defined in the given code. It seems that the intended functionality is to replace "push" with "push --force". However, this replacement should only be done if "push" is found as a separate word in the command.

To fix the bug, we should use regular expressions to ensure that "push" is replaced with "push --force" only if it is a separate word.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return re.sub(r'\bpush\b', 'push --force', command.script)
```

By using the `re.sub` function with the regular expression `\bpush\b`, we ensure that "push" is replaced with "push --force" only when it is a separate word. This will fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
