Potential error location:
The function is intended to add the "--force" flag to the "git push" command, but it currently only replaces "push" with "push --force" in the command string. 

Reason for the bug:
The current implementation does not consider the possibility of additional arguments being passed with the "git push" command, which would be lost when using the replace_argument function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the function to append the "--force" flag to the existing arguments in the "git push" command, rather than just replacing the command.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    args = command.script.split()[1:]
    new_args = args + ['--force']
    return Command(' '.join(['git push'] + new_args))
```
