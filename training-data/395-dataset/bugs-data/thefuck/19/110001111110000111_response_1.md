Potential error location: The `get_new_command` function appears to be incorrectly replacing the "push" command with "push --force" instead of "push --force-with-lease".

Reasons for the bug: The `get_new_command` function is not correctly replacing the "push" command with "push --force" because it is missing the "--force-with-lease" argument.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `get_new_command` function to correctly replace the "push" command with "push --force-with-lease" using regular expressions or string manipulation.
2. Update the `get_new_command` function to check for the presence of "--force-with-lease" before replacing the "push" command.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force-with-lease')
```
