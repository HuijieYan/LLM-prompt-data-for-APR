The problematic code is the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to add `--force` to the `git push` command, but the test cases expect it to add `--force-with-lease`.

The reason for the bug is that the `get_new_command` function is hardcoding the replacement. Instead of just appending `--force`, it should check if `--force-with-lease` is supported and then replace it accordingly.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function needs to be modified to perform a conditional check for the presence of `--force-with-lease` in the command and replace it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--force' in command.script:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
    else:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```

With this modification, the function will correctly replace `git push` with `git push --force` or `git push --force-with-lease` based on the presence of the respective flag in the original command.
