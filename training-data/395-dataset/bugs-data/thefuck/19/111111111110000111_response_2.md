The problematic function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a command and replace the 'push' argument with 'push --force'. However, the test cases are expecting 'push --force-with-lease' instead. This indicates that the replacement in the `get_new_command` function is incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the `get_new_command` function is replacing 'push' with 'push --force' instead of 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease'. This is leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to correctly replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from thefuck.shells import git_support
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
```
