Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the `get_new_command` function, where it tries to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force'.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `get_new_command` function does not handle all possible cases of the 'git push' command. It only looks for the 'push' command and replaces it with 'push --force', which may not work in all scenarios.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should check if the 'push' command is followed by a branch name. If it is, then it should replace it with 'push --force' followed by the branch name. If there are other arguments or options provided with the 'git push' command, they should also be retained in the new command.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script and '--force' not in command.script:
        new_script = command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force')
        return new_script
    else:
        return command.script
```
