The buggy function is using the `@git_support` decorator, which doesn't seem to be defined or provided in the code. As a result, the function is failing to execute properly.

To fix this bug, the `@git_support` decorator should be removed from the function definition.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
