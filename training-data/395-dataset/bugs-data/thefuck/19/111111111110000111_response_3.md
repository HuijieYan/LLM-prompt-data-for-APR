The bug in the `get_new_command` method is related to the `replace_argument` function. It is replacing the 'push' command with 'push --force' unconditionally. However, the test cases are expecting 'push --force-with-lease' instead of 'push --force'. 

The error occurs because the `get_new_command` method is not using the `--force-with-lease` option as expected by the test cases.

To fix this bug, the `replace_argument` function should be updated to include the `--force-with-lease` option instead of `--force`. This would address the mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

```python
# Buggy function source code
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
```
