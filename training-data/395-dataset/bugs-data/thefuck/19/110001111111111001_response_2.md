The buggy function is a decorator `@git_support` with a function `get_new_command`, which takes a `command` as a parameter and is supposed to replace the occurrence of `'push'` with `'push --force'` in the `command.script`. However, the function seems to be incorrectly implementing the replacement logic, resulting in failing test cases.

The error message indicates that the actual output generated by the `get_new_command` function does not match the expected output for each test case. This suggests that the logic for replacing the push command is incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not properly handling the cases where the push command includes additional arguments after `'git push'`. The function is only replacing the first occurrence of `'push'` with `'push --force'`, which is incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the replacement logic to ensure that the correct replacement is made regardless of additional arguments after `'git push'`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force', 1)
```

By using the `replace` function with a count of 1, we ensure that only the first occurrence of 'git push' is replaced with 'git push --force', preserving any additional arguments that may follow the push command.

With this correction, the function should now produce the expected outputs for the provided test cases.
