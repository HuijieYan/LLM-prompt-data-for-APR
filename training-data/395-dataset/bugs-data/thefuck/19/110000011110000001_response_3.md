The error in the function is related to the incorrect replacement of the `push` command in Git with `push --force`. The error message in the test cases indicates that the expected output includes the flag `--force-with-lease`, whereas the buggy function is only replacing `push` with `push --force`.

The buggy function `get_new_command` is not correctly replacing the `push` command with `push --force` and `push --force-with-lease` when needed.

To fix the function, it's necessary to replace the `push` command with `push --force` when the original command contains `push`. This can be done by using a simple if-else statement.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
    else:
        return command.script
```
