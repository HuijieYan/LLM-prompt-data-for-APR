Potential error location: The buggy function `get_new_command` is not correctly replacing the "push" command with "push --force." The buggy function is using `replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')`, which is incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy function is not properly handling the case where "push" is followed by additional arguments. It simply replaces "push" with "push --force," but this does not account for additional arguments that might follow "push."

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the function to properly handle the case where "push" is followed by additional arguments. We should replace "push" with "push --force" only when there are no additional arguments after "push."

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if script_parts[0] == 'git' and script_parts[1] == 'push':
        return ' '.join(script_parts[:2] + ['--force'] + script_parts[2:])
    else:
        return command.script
```
