The buggy function is using a decorator `@git_support` which is not defined in the provided code. This is causing the function to throw an error.

The potential error location is the use of the `@git_support` decorator.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `@git_support` decorator is not defined, so it is causing the function to throw an error.

To fix the bug, the decorator `@git_support` needs to be defined or removed from the function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
