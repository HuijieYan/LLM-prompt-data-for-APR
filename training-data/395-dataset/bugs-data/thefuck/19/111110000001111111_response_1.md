The problematic function is a decorator `@git_support` that is applied to the function `get_new_command`. However, the decorator itself is not implemented, so it causes an error.

The decorator `@git_support` should be removed because it is not implemented and is not needed for the `get_new_command` function.

After removing the decorator, the corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
