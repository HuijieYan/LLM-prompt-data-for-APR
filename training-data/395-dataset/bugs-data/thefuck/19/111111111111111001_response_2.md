The problem with the given function is that it replaces 'push' with 'push --force' without considering whether the original command contained any additional arguments or not. This is leading to incorrect assertions in the test cases.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle the case where 'push' is followed by other arguments.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script.split():
        new_script = command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
        return Command(script=new_script, stdout=command.stdout, stderr=command.stderr)
    else:
        return command
```

In this corrected version, we check if the original command contains the word 'push' and then replace it with 'push --force' if it does. Otherwise, we return the original command unchanged.

By making this change, the function now handles all cases where 'push' is part of the original command, and the test cases should pass without any issues.
