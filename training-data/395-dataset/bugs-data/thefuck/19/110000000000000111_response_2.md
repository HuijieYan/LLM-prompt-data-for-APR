The potential error in the code is the use of the @git_support decorator, which is not a built-in decorator in Python.

The reason for the bug is that the @git_support decorator is not a valid decorator, so it's causing a syntax error when the function is defined.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the @git_support decorator from the function and simply define the function without any decorators.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
