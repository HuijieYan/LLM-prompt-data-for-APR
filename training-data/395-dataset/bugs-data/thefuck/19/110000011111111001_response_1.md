The buggy function `get_new_command` is using a decorator named `@git_support`, but it's not implemented anywhere in the given code. This is likely causing the function to not behave as expected and produce incorrect results.

The bug seems to originate from the incorrect usage of the `@git_support` decorator. Since the decorator is not provided in the given context, it is causing the `get_new_command` function to produce incorrect results.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to remove the decorator `@git_support` and directly define the function as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force')
```

This corrected function directly replaces 'git push' with 'git push --force' in the `command.script`, which should produce the expected results for the provided test cases.

Please note that this fix assumes that the objective of the `get_new_command` function is to add the `--force` flag to the 'git push' command.

If the actual intention of the `@git_support` decorator is to modify the behavior of the function based on some external configuration, then the implementation of the decorator should be provided as well. Without the implementation of the decorator, it's not possible to fully restore the intended behavior of the `get_new_command` function.
