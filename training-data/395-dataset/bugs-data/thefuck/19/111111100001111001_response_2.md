The buggy function is intended to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force' in a git command. However, the current implementation of the function only replaces 'push' with 'push --force' without considering the existing arguments. This approach doesn't cover all cases and could lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the addition of '--force' according to the existing arguments in the command. This can be achieved by parsing the command and inserting '--force' in the appropriate position.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if 'push' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('push') + 1
        script_parts.insert(index, '--force')
        updated_script = ' '.join(script_parts)
        return Command(updated_script, command.stdout, command.stderr)
    else:
        return command
```
