The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` is that it uses an undeclared decorator `@git_support`. This decorator is not defined in the given code, which causes an error when the function is called.

The error messages from the test function imply that the function `get_new_command` is not returning the expected output. This in turn means that the replacement of the argument 'push' with 'push --force' is not being performed correctly.

To fix this bug, the decorator `@git_support` should be removed, and the `replace_argument` function should be used to replace the argument 'push' with 'push --force'. The function `replace_argument` is not provided, so we assume it's a custom function that is responsible for replacing the argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# corrected get_new_command function
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force --force-with-lease')
```

The corrected function does not include the undefined `@git_support` decorator and uses the `replace_argument` function to correctly replace the 'push' command with 'push --force --force-with-lease', as indicated by the expected output in the test cases.
