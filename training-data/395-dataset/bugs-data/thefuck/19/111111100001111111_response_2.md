The buggy function is attempting to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force' in the input command. However, it's not considering if the 'push' command is followed by any other arguments, such as a branch name or a remote repository name.

The bug occurs because the function `replace_argument` doesn't handle cases where the 'push' command is followed by additional arguments. As a result, it only replaces the 'push' command with 'push --force' without considering the context of the command.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the 'push' command is followed by other arguments and then replace it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if command.script.startswith("git push"):
        return replace_command(command.script, "git push", "git push --force")
    else:
        return command
```

In this corrected code, the `get_new_command` function checks if the input command starts with "git push". If it does, it replaces "git push" with "git push --force". Otherwise, it returns the original command unchanged.

This approach ensures that the 'push' command is replaced with 'push --force' only when it's the entire command or the first part of the command.
