The error in the function `get_new_command` is that it is attempting to use the `@git_support` decorator, which is not defined in the given code. This decorator is likely intended to handle some functionality related to git commands, but it is not provided in the code.

The reason for the error might be that the `@git_support` decorator is not defined or imported properly. It could be missing from the codebase or from an external library that is not included in the provided snippet.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to define the `@git_support` decorator with the proper functionality related to handling git commands. If the `@git_support` decorator is part of an external library, make sure to import it correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function without the `@git_support` decorator:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```

This code removes the `@git_support` decorator and defines the `get_new_command` function with the necessary functionality to replace the "push" command with "push --force".
