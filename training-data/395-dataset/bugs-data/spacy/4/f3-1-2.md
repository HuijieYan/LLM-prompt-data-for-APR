The issue description is:

```text
I got a conllU file, from my university, where the head column is filled with .
Processing such file with the cli.convert method will result in a int cast error in
https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/master/spacy/cli/converters/conllu2json.py line 73
in the read_conllx method (head = (int(head) - 1) if head != "0" else id).

In the format documentation on https://universaldependencies.org/format.html
there is stated that: the allowed values for head are the same as for id (so _ should not be allowed)
"7. HEAD: Head of the current word, which is either a value of ID or zero (0)."

But some lines later, underscore "" is only forbidden for the id column.
"Underscore () is used to denote unspecified values in all fields except ID. Note that no format-level distinction is made for the rare cases where the FORM or LEMMA is the literal underscore â€“ processing in such cases is application-dependent. Further, in UD treebanks the UPOS, HEAD, and DEPREL columns are not allowed to be left unspecified."

So, the university guys who gave me the problematic conll file insits on beeing right in allowing _ in the head column and asked me to write a bug report here.
