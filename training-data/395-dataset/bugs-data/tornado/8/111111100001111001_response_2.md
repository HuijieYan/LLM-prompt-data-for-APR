The buggy code is the `accept_connection` function inside the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. This function is supposed to handle WebSocket connections, but there are several issues with it.

The function attempts to call `_handle_websocket_headers()` and `_accept_connection()` and then catch a `ValueError` and log the error. However, the except block does not handle the `ValueError` case correctly, and instead of re-raising the exception or handling it properly, it swallows the exception and continues running the code. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential issues.

Additionally, the function is supposed to return after logging the error, but it does not have a return statement after the logging. This means that the function will continue running after the error is logged, which may not be the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, the except block should handle the `ValueError` properly, either by re-raising the exception or by handling it in a meaningful way. Also, a return statement should be added after logging the error to ensure that the function stops execution at that point.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: {}".format(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
