The main issue is with the `accept_connection` function, which calls other functions in the wrong order and also does not handle exceptions correctly. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Error accepting WebSocket connection", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
```

This corrected function includes handling other exceptions as well.
