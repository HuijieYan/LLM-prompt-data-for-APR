The error occurs in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketHandler` class when the required headers for the websocket handshake are missing. This results in an AttributeError because the `self.stream` attribute is not yet created at this point, and the `self.stream.close()` call in the `_abort` method fails.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `accept_connection` method to handle the missing headers appropriately without trying to access the non-existent `self.stream`.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
    except AttributeError:  # handle the AttributeError due to missing self.stream
        gen_log.debug("Missing WebSocket stream", exc_info=True)
        return
```
