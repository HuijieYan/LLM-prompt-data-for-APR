Potential error location: The try-except block in the accept_connection method is catching a ValueError, but it is not clear why a ValueError might be raised from the _handle_websocket_headers and _accept_connection methods.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug might occur because the _handle_websocket_headers and _accept_connection methods might be raising a different type of exception other than ValueError. As a result, the code in the except block is not handling the correct exception.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Update the except block to catch all types of exceptions by using the general Exception class.
2. Add specific error handling for the potential exceptions raised by _handle_websocket_headers and _accept_connection methods.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Error in WebSocket connection: {}".format(str(e)), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
