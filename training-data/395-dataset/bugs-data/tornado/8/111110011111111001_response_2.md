The error is occurring at the `self.assertEqual(response.code, 400)` line in the `test_missing_websocket_key` test function. The test is expecting a response code of 400, but it is getting a response code of 500, indicating an internal server error.

The potential error location within the `accept_connection` function is the return statement. The function should not return after logging the error, as this will prevent the server from sending the appropriate response code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when an error is caught, the function logs the error and immediately returns. This prevents the server from handling the error properly and sending the correct response code.

To fix the bug, we should remove the return statement after logging the error and allow the server to continue processing the request.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
```

With this correction, the server will be able to handle the error properly and send the correct response code without prematurely returning from the function.
