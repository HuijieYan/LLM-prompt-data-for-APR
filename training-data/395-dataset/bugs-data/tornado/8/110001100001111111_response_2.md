The error is occurring in the `accept_connection` function of the WebSocketProtocol13 class. When the required headers are missing from the WebSocket handshake request, the function immediately calls the `_abort` function, which tries to close the `self.stream`. However, since the handshake has not completed, `self.stream` is None, leading to the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close' error.

To fix this issue, we need to add a nullity check for `self.stream` before attempting to close it in the `_abort` function.

Updated code:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return

def _abort(self):
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()
    self.close()

# Optional: If self.close() also calls self.stream.close(), you may need to add a nullity check in self.close() as well.
def close(self):
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()
    # ...other code...
```

By adding the nullity check for `self.stream` in the `_abort` function, the AttributeError should be resolved.
