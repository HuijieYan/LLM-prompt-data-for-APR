Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the `_handle_websocket_headers` method of the `WebSocketHandler` class in the `tornado.websocket` module.

Reasons behind the bug: 
- The `_handle_websocket_headers` method is raising a `ValueError` if the required WebSocket headers are missing, but the `accept_connection` method does not handle this error properly.
- This results in the `self._abort()` method being called without properly setting up the `self.stream`, leading to an `AttributeError` when attempting to close `self.stream`.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
- Catch the `ValueError` raised by the `_handle_websocket_headers` method in the `accept_connection` method and properly handle it to avoid calling `self._abort()` prematurely.
- Check for the existence of `self.stream` before attempting to close it in the `_abort` method.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected accept_connection method
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort(ValueError)
        return

# Updated _abort method
def _abort(self, error=None):
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
    if error is not None:
        # handle error here
        pass
```
