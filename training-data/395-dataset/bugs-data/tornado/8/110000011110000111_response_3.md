The error in the provided code is related to the `accept_connection` method in the WebSocketProtocol13 class. In the test case, the client is sending a request to the server without the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header. This causes the server to raise a ValueError due to missing or invalid WebSocket headers. 

The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` method immediately calls the `_abort` method if there are missing required headers, before the handshake is completed. This results in a situation where `self.stream` is None, and when `_abort` attempts to close the stream, it results in an AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the `accept_connection` method should check for the presence of required headers before calling `_abort`. If the headers are missing, an appropriate error response should be sent back to the client.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        if not self.stream:
            self._abort()
            return
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

By adding the check for `self.stream`, the code ensures that the `_abort` method is only called when the stream is available, preventing the AttributeError.
