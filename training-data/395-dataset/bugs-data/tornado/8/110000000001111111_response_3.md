The error occurs when the WebSocketProtocol13.accept_connection function is called and the client is missing the required headers for the WebSocket handshake. This leads to the _handle_websocket_headers function raising a ValueError with the message "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers". Since the _handle_websocket_headers function is called within the accept_connection function, the error occurs there.

The reason for this error is that the _abort function is called immediately after the ValueError is caught within the accept_connection function, and it attempts to access the self.stream attribute which may be None at that point, leading to an AttributeError.

To fix this error, the _abort function and the code within the accept_connection function should be modified to handle the case when self.stream is None.

Here's the corrected code for the accept_connection function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        if self.stream is not None:
            self._abort()
        return
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check for self.stream before calling the _abort function. This ensures that the _abort function is not called if self.stream is None, preventing the AttributeError.
