1. The test case is checking for the response code when a websocket key is missing.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `accept_connection` method.
3. The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` method catches a `ValueError` exception but does not handle or log it. Instead, it logs a debug message for a "Malformed WebSocket request received" and returns without specifying the response code.
4. To fix the bug, we should handle the exception properly and raise an appropriate error response code.
5. Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
        self.set_status(400)
        self.finish()
```
