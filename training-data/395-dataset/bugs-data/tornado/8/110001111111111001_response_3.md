Potential error location: The error seems to occur in the `accept_connection` method where there is a try-except block, and if an exception of type ValueError is caught, it logs a debug message and then calls the `_abort` method.

Reasons behind the bug: The error is likely occurring because the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` methods are not raising a ValueError when they encounter a problem. So, the `except ValueError` block is not being triggered.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the implementation of `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` methods to ensure that they raise a ValueError when appropriate.
2. Update the `accept_connection` method to handle the specific exception being raised by the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` method.

Corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:
```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:  # Catch specific exception raised by _handle_websocket_headers and _accept_connection methods
        if isinstance(e, ValueError):
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
        else:
            raise  # Re-raise any other exceptions
```
