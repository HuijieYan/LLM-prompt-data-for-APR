1. The error occurs when the WebSocketProtocol13.accept_connection function is called before the handshake, resulting in a missing self.stream attribute and causing an AttributeError when trying to close it.

2. The potential error location is in the _abort function, where it tries to close the self.stream attribute without checking for its existence first.

3. The bug occurs because the accept_connection function calls the _abort function before the handshake is completed, leading to the AttributeError due to the missing self.stream attribute.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the accept_connection function to only call the _abort function after the handshake is completed and the self.stream attribute is initialized. Additionally, the _abort function should be modified to check for the existence of self.stream before trying to close it.

5. Here is the corrected code for the accept_connection function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                       exc_info=True)
        # Check if self.stream exists before aborting
        if getattr(self, 'stream', None) is not None:
            self._abort()
        return
```

And the corrected code for the _abort function:

```python
def _abort(self):
    if getattr(self, 'stream', None) is not None:
        self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
```
