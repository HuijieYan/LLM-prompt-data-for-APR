The buggy function accept_connection(self) is supposed to handle WebSocket connections by calling the _handle_websocket_headers() and _accept_connection() functions. However, there are some issues in the code.

1. The try-except block catches a ValueError, but the except block does not handle it properly. Instead, it just logs a debug message and then calls the _abort() function. This behavior is incorrect as it does not handle the exception or the WebSocket connection properly.

2. The code does not provide any specific error message or handling for different types of exceptions that may occur.

To fix the bug, we can modify the accept_connection() function to properly handle the ValueError and any other exceptions that may occur during the WebSocket connection process.

Here's the corrected code for the accept_connection() function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        # optionally re-raise the exception if needed
        # raise
        return
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("An error occurred during WebSocket connection: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        # optionally re-raise the exception if needed
        # raise
        return
```

In the corrected code, we have added proper exception handling for the ValueError as well as a generic exception handling block. This will ensure that any exceptions during the WebSocket connection process are logged and the _abort() function is called to handle the connection appropriately.
