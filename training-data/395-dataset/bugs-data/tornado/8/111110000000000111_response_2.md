The error here is an AttributeError when the WebSocket client misses the required header for the handshake. The error occurs in the `accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class when it tries to call the `_abort` function and return. The `_abort` function then tries to close `self.stream`, which is likely to be None at this point, causing the AttributeError.

To fix this, we need to modify the `accept_connection` function to handle the case where `self.stream` is None before calling `_abort`. We also need to handle the ValueError exception that is raised when the required WebSocket headers are missing before calling `_abort`.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
    except AttributeError:
        # Handle the case where self.stream is None
        return
```
