The test case provided shows that the server raises an AttributeError when the client misses the required header for the websocket handshake. The error occurs at the line `self.stream.close()` in the `_abort` function, which is called from the `accept_connection` function.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_abort` function is called before the handshake, so there is no `self.stream` yet. This causes an AttributeError when trying to close a non-existent stream.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to check the existence of `self.stream` before trying to close it, and also to move the call to `_abort` after the handshake has been completed.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        # Move the call to _abort after the handshake
        return
    self._abort()
```
