The error occurs in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. The method tries to handle the WebSocket headers and accept the connection, but if a `ValueError` is raised, it logs an error message and then calls the `_abort` method.

The error in the code is that the exception being caught and logged is `ValueError`, but the test case is expecting a response with status code 400 (Bad Request), which indicates that the issue is not being handled correctly. The `ValueError` does not accurately represent a missing or invalid WebSocket key.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` method should handle the scenario of missing or invalid WebSocket headers and return a 400 Bad Request response instead of catching a `ValueError` and logging an error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    headers = self.handler.request.headers
    if 'Sec-WebSocket-Version' not in headers or 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' not in headers:
        self.handler.set_status(400)
        self.handler.finish()
    else:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
``` 

With this fix, the `accept_connection` method checks for the presence of 'Sec-WebSocket-Version' and 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' headers. If any of them are missing, it sets the status to 400 and finishes the request. If both headers are present, it proceeds with handling the headers and accepting the connection.
