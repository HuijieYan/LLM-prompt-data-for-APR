Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided code is within the accept_connection() function. The code currently catches a ValueError exception and logs an error message, but it does not handle the exception in a way that allows the code to continue executing.

Reason behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The current code catches a ValueError exception but does not handle it properly. As a result, it logs an error message and then returns, which may not be the desired behavior. This can lead to unexpected termination of the function without allowing the code to continue executing.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of catching and logging the exception, the code should handle it in a way that allows the execution to continue if possible.
2. It could also involve adding additional error handling or logging to provide more information about the specific error that occurred.

Corrected Code:
```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % str(e),
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        # Additional handling or logging as needed
```
