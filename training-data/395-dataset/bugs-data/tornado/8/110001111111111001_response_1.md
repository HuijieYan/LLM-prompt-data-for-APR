The error message from the test function indicates that the response code is 500, but the expected code is 400. This suggests that there is an issue with the WebSocket connection or upgrade, which is likely related to the `accept_connection` function.

Upon analyzing the `accept_connection` function, it seems that the try-except block catches `ValueError` when calling `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions. However, it does not handle other potential errors that could occur during the WebSocket connection establishment.

The log message "Malformed WebSocket request received" suggests that there might be an issue with the WebSocket request, but it's currently not providing enough information. Additionally, the `self._abort()` line should be executed regardless of the exception type.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `accept_connection` function to handle all potential errors and provide more detailed log messages. We can also ensure that the `_abort` function is called regardless of the exception type.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.error(f"Error during WebSocket connection establishment: {e}", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
```

In this corrected code, we added an additional `except` block to catch any other exceptions that may occur during the WebSocket connection establishment. We also added a more detailed log message for generic errors. Lastly, we ensured that the `_abort` function is called in all error cases.
