The test case is trying to mimic a situation where the WebSocket connection is missing the required key. The expected response code is 400, but the actual response code is 500, indicating an internal server error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the try-except block. When an exception of type `ValueError` is caught, the function logs a debug message, aborts the connection, and returns. However, this does not handle the actual WebSocket error properly, leading to the server responding with a 500 error code.

The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` function is catching a `ValueError` exception but not specifically handling this scenario where the WebSocket headers are missing or invalid.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` function should catch the specific exception that is raised when the WebSocket headers are missing or invalid, and then properly handle it by returning the 400 error code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except MissingWebSocketHeadersError:  # assuming MissingWebSocketHeadersError is the specific exception for missing headers
        gen_log.debug("Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
