1. The test case is testing for the response code when there is a missing 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header, but the actual response code is different from the expected response code.

2. The potential error location is within the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class, specifically in the `try-except` block.

3. The bug occurs because the `except` block catches a `ValueError` exception, but the actual exception being raised might be different, resulting in the wrong code path being executed.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to handle the specific exception that is being raised when there is a missing 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header. Additionally, the code in the `except` block should be modified to reflect the correct response behavior.

5. Corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except MissingWebSocketKeyError:  # Assuming MissingWebSocketKeyError is the specific exception for a missing key
        gen_log.debug("Missing 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return 400  # Assuming 400 is the correct response code for a missing header
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return 400  # Assuming 400 is the correct response code for a malformed request
```
