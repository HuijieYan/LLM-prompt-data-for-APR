The potential error in the provided function is the use of the `except` block without specifying the error type. This means that it will catch any type of error, including ones that are not necessarily related to the `accept_connection` code.

The error occurs because the `except` block only catches `ValueError` exceptions, but the code within the block is attempting to catch a `ValueError` exception which may not be raised by the code.

To fix the bug, the `except` block should specify the type of exception it wants to catch. In this case, it could be catching any exception that is raised when calling `_handle_websocket_headers` or `_accept_connection`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
