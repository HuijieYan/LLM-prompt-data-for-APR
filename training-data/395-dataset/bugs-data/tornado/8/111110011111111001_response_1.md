The potential error location within the problematic function is the `accept_connection` method. The `accept_connection` method is catching a `ValueError` exception, but the test case is expecting a response with code 400, which indicates a Bad Request. This suggests that the exception that is being caught in the `accept_connection` method should instead return a 400 response.

The reason behind the bug is that the `accept_connection` method is catching a `ValueError` exception, which may not be the appropriate exception to catch in this case. It is likely that the websocket request is missing the required headers, leading to a malformed request, which should be handled differently.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` method should handle the case where the required headers are missing or invalid. Instead of catching a `ValueError` exception, it should directly return a 400 response in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    if not self._check_websocket_headers():
        self._abort(400, 'Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers')
        return
    self._handle_websocket_headers()
    self._accept_connection()
``` 

In the corrected code, the `_check_websocket_headers` method is used to check if the required WebSocket headers are present and valid. If not, a 400 response is returned with the message 'Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers'. Otherwise, the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` methods are executed as before.
