The error is occurring because the `_handle_websocket_headers` method raises a ValueError when the required WebSocket headers are missing, which leads to the `accept_connection` method calling the `_abort` method. The `_abort` method then tries to close `self.stream`, which is not initialized at this point, resulting in the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close' error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `self.stream` is None before attempting to close it in the `_abort` method. Additionally, we should handle the ValueError in the `accept_connection` method to prevent the AttributeError from being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        self.on_close()  # Close the connection gracefully
        return
```

In this corrected code, we handle the ValueError exception and call `self.on_close()` to close the connection gracefully. This should prevent the AttributeError from being raised when `self.stream` is None.
