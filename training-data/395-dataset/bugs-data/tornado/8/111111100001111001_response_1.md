The buggy function `accept_connection` is supposed to handle WebSocket headers and accept the WebSocket connection. However, there are a couple of issues in the function:

1. The function is catching `ValueError` exceptions, but the code inside the `try` block does not raise a `ValueError`. It seems like the intention was to catch exceptions related to handling WebSocket headers and accepting connections, but the except block only logs a debug message and calls `_abort()`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or unhandled exceptions.

2. The `_abort()` method is not defined in the code provided. It is likely that `_abort()` is meant to handle the case of a malformed WebSocket request, but it is not implemented correctly.

To fix the bug, we should:
- Update the `accept_connection` function to catch the specific exceptions that can be raised when handling WebSocket headers and accepting connections. 
- Implement the `_abort()` method to handle the case of a malformed WebSocket request.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except SomeSpecificException as e:  # Replace SomeSpecificException with the actual exception that can occur
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: {}".format(str(e)), exc_info=True)
        self._abort("Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers")
        return
```

Note: I added `SomeSpecificException` as a placeholder for the actual exception that can occur when handling WebSocket headers and accepting connections. Replace `SomeSpecificException` with the appropriate exception class.

And here's the implementation for the `_abort` method:

```python
def _abort(self, log_msg):
    gen_log.error(log_msg)
    # Handle the abort logic here, such as closing the connection or sending an error response
```
