The error occurs when the `_abort` function is called in the `accept_connection` method. When there are missing or invalid WebSocket headers, ValueError is raised, leading to the `_abort` method being called immediately. However, the `_abort` method attempts to close the `self.stream`, which may not exist at that point, causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, a check should be added to ensure that `self.stream` exists before attempting to close it in the `_abort` method.

Fixed code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_8/tornado/websocket.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _abort(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    if self.stream:
        self.stream.close()

# relative function's signature in this file
def _handle_websocket_headers(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _accept_connection(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass



# this is the fixed function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
