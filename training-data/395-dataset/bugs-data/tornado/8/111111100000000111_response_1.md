The test case is related to a missing required header for the websocket handshake, which causes the server to raise an `AttributeError`. The error occurs in the `accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class.

The reason behind the bug is that the `accept_connection` function calls the `_abort` function immediately if there are missing required headers, even before the handshake. This causes the `_abort` function to assume the existence of `self.stream` and call `self.stream.close()`, resulting in an `AttributeError` when `self.stream` is `None`.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` function should check for the existence of `self.stream` before calling the `_abort` function, and the `_abort` function should also check the nullity of `self.stream` before calling `self.stream.close()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected version of the accept_connection function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        if self.stream is not None:  # Check for the existence of self.stream
            self._abort()
        return
```

And the corrected version of the `_abort` function:
```python
# corrected version of the _abort function
def _abort(self):
    if self.stream is not None:  # Check for the existence of self.stream
        self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
```

With these changes, the `accept_connection` function will now check for the existence of `self.stream` before calling the `_abort` function, and the `_abort` function will also check the nullity of `self.stream` before calling `self.stream.close()`.
