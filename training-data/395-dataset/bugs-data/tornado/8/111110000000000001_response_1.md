The potential error in the provided function is the except block, which catches a ValueError and logs a debug message. However, the program then immediately returns without closing the connection or performing any other necessary clean-up actions.

The bug occurs because the except block does not handle the exception properly and does not perform the necessary clean-up actions.

To fix the bug, the except block should catch the exception, log the error message, perform clean-up actions (such as closing the connection), and then potentially re-raise the exception or return a specific value to indicate the failure.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        # Perform additional clean-up actions here
        # Close the connection, return an error code, etc.
        # Example:
        # return "Error: Malformed WebSocket request"
```
