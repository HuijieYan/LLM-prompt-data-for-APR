The test case `test_missing_websocket_key` is sending a websocket handshake request without the required 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header. The server is responding with a 500 error code, indicating an internal server error, instead of the expected 400 error code for a bad request.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the `accept_connection` function is calling `self._handle_websocket_headers()` and `self._accept_connection()`. If an error occurs in these two functions, the `except` block should catch the `ValueError` and handle it appropriately. However, the except block currently only logs the error and calls `self._abort()` without changing the response code.

The bug is occurring because when the required headers are missing, the `ValueError` is raised in the `_handle_websocket_headers` function, but the exception is not caught and properly handled in the `accept_connection` function.

One approach to fixing the bug is to catch the `ValueError` properly in the `accept_connection` function and set the HTTP response code to 400. Additionally, it would be good to provide a more descriptive error message for the client.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % e, exc_info=True)
        self.set_status(400)
        self.finish("Bad request: %s" % e)
```

With this correction, the `accept_connection` function catches the `ValueError` and sets the HTTP response code to 400, providing a descriptive error message to the client.
