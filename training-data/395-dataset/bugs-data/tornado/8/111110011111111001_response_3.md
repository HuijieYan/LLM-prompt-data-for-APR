The error in the `accept_connection` method seems to be related to the response code comparison in the test function. 

Looking at the `accept_connection` method, the issue appears to be in the handling of exceptions. The method catches `ValueError` and logs a message but then proceeds to call the `_abort` method and return, potentially resulting in a 500 error code instead of the expected 400 error code.

The reason behind the bug is that the method catches `ValueError` but does not handle it properly or propagate the appropriate error code to the response.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to handle the `ValueError` explicitly and set the response code as 400 before returning from the method.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self.set_status(400)
        self.finish()
```
