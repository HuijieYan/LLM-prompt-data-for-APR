The error occurs because the response code is not as expected. This is likely due to an issue in the `accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. 

The function `accept_connection` is catching a `ValueError` exception, but the test case is expecting a response code of 400, indicating a bad request. This suggests that the exception being caught is not the expected one.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to change the exception being caught from `ValueError` to `tornado.httpclient.HTTPError` which would handle the 400 error code.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
        try:
            self._handle_websocket_headers()
            self._accept_connection()
        except tornado.httpclient.HTTPError:  # Catch HTTP errors
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
            self._abort()
            return
```

By catching `tornado.httpclient.HTTPError` instead of `ValueError`, the function will now handle the 400 error code correctly.
