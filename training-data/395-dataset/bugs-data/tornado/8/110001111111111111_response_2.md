The provided error message suggests that the server is returning a 500 error code instead of the expected 400 error code when a required WebSocket header is missing from the client request.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the try-except block in the accept_connection method where it catches a ValueError and returns from the function, causing the server to return a 500 error code instead of the expected 400 error code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the accept_connection method is not handling the missing required WebSocket header properly and is returning an internal server error (500) instead of a bad request error (400).

To fix the bug, we can modify the accept_connection method to handle the missing required WebSocket header and return a 400 error code appropriately. This can be achieved by adding a check for the missing header and returning a 400 error code if the required header is not present.

Here's the corrected code for the accept_connection method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    if not self.handler.request.headers.get('Sec-WebSocket-Key'):
        gen_log.debug("Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return

    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header is present in the request. If it's not present, we log the error and return a 400 error code. Otherwise, we proceed with the normal WebSocket handshake process.
