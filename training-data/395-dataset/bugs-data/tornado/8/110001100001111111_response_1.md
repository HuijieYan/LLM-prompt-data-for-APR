The error occurs because if the client misses the required header for the websocket handshake, the server raises a ValueError, and then the `_abort` function is called. However, it is called before the websocket handshake, so there is no `self.stream` available, which results in an AttributeError when it tries to `close()` the `self.stream`.

To fix this bug, the `_abort` function needs to be modified to check whether `self.stream` exists before trying to close it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        if self.stream:
            self._abort()
        return
```
