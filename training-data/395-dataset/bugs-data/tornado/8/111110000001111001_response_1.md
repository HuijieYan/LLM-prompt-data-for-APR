The buggy function `accept_connection` in the class `WebSocketProtocol13` is designed to handle WebSocket connections. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation.

1. The `accept_connection` function is catching a `ValueError` exception but not handling it properly. It logs an error message using `gen_log.debug` and then calls `_abort()` method, but it does not re-raise the exception or handle it in a meaningful way. Additionally, it does not preserve the original exception traceback.

2. There are no input parameters for the `accept_connection` function, but based on the provided input parameter runtime values and types, it seems that the function should have `self` parameter along with `self.handler` property.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` function should handle the `ValueError` exception more effectively, and the input parameters should be explicitly defined.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def accept_connection(self, handler):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % e, exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to preserve the original traceback
```

In this corrected code:
- The `accept_connection` function now explicitly takes `self` and `handler` as input parameters.
- The `ValueError` exception is caught and its message is included in the log message using `%s` formatting.
- The original exception traceback is preserved by re-raising the exception after handling it.

With these changes, the `accept_connection` function should handle exceptions more effectively and provide better error logging.
