The test case `test_missing_websocket_key` is designed to simulate a scenario where the client sends a WebSocket handshake request with a missing required header. The expected behavior in this case is for the server to respond with an HTTP status code of 400.

The bug seems to be occurring in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. In this method, it immediately calls the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` methods and catches any `ValueError` exceptions thrown during their execution. However, the error handling appears to be incorrect, leading to an AttributeError later on.

The reason for the bug is that if a `ValueError` is caught, the `_abort` method is called, which attempts to close `self.stream`. However, if a `ValueError` is caught, it means that the WebSocket headers are missing or invalid, and the WebSocket connection has not been fully established yet. Therefore, `self.stream` might still be `None` or not properly initialized, leading to the AttributeError when attempting to close it.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the `accept_connection` method to handle the possibility that `self.stream` might be `None` or not properly initialized. Additionally, the method should not handle `ValueError` exceptions in the same way, as they indicate missing or invalid WebSocket headers rather than a general exception.

```python
class WebSocketProtocol13(WebSocketProtocol):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def accept_connection(self):
        try:
            self._handle_websocket_headers()
            self._accept_connection()
        except ValueError:
            gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
            if self.stream is not None:
                self._abort()
        except Exception:
            gen_log.debug("Unexpected error during WebSocket handshake", exc_info=True)
            if self.stream is not None:
                self._abort()

    def _abort(self):
        if self.stream is not None:
            self.stream.close()
        # ... other abort logic ...
```

In the modified `accept_connection` method, specific exceptions are caught and handled appropriately. Additionally, the `_abort` method is also updated to check if `self.stream` is not `None` before attempting to close it. This should help prevent the AttributeError that was observed in the original code.
