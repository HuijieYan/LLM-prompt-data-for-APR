The error occurs in the `accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. When the client misses the required headers for the WebSocket handshake, it raises a `ValueError` in the `_handle_websocket_headers` function, and then the `_abort` function is called. This causes an `AttributeError` since `self.stream` is `None` at that point, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, a `try-except` block can be utilized to catch the `ValueError` and handle it appropriately. Additionally, it's important to ensure that `self.stream` is not `None` before attempting to close it in the `_abort` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()

def _abort(self):
    if self.stream is not None:  # Check if self.stream is not None before attempting to close
        self.stream.close()
    else:
        # Handle the situation where self.stream is None
        gen_log.error("Stream is None when trying to close")

def _handle_websocket_headers(self):
    if not all(header in self.request.headers for header in ["Upgrade", "Connection", "Sec-WebSocket-Version"]):
        raise ValueError("Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers")
```

By using a `try-except` block, the `Malformed WebSocket request received` message is logged, and then `_abort` is called. Additionally, a check is added in the `_abort` function to ensure that `self.stream` is not `None` before closing it. This prevents the `AttributeError` when the test is executed.
