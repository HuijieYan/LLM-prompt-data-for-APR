The test case is trying to simulate a scenario where the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header is missing in the request, and it expects the response code to be 400. However, the actual response code is 500, indicating that the server-side code is not handling this case correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the accept_connection method of the WebSocketProtocol13 class. This method is supposed to handle the WebSocket connection, but it is not properly catching the ValueError exception that might be raised when the required headers are missing in the request.

The bug occurs because the accept_connection method is using a generic catch-all except block that catches all exceptions, rather than specifically catching the ValueError that might be raised if the required headers are missing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the accept_connection method to specifically catch the ValueError exception when it occurs. If the ValueError exception is caught, the method should log the error and return a 400 response code.

Here's the corrected code for the accept_connection method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        self.write_error(400)  # Return 400 response code
        self.finish()  # Finish the request
        return
```

By specifically catching the ValueError exception and returning a 400 response code, the accept_connection method will handle the case where the required headers are missing in the request, and the test case should pass successfully.
