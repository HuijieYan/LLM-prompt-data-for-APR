The potential error location within the problematic function is the except block. Currently, it catches a ValueError, but the error received in the test function is an AssertionError, indicating that the error is not being handled correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the except block is only catching ValueError, while the error received during the test is of type AssertionError. This means that the function is not handling all possible errors that might occur during the execution of `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions.

To fix the bug, the except block should be modified to catch all possible exceptions, not just ValueError. Additionally, the function should probably return a specific status code in case of failure, like 400 in the test case provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Error occurred during WebSocket connection acceptance: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return 400  # assuming 400 for bad request
```

In the corrected code, I used a generic Exception to catch all possible errors that might occur during the execution of `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` functions. I also included the error message in the log and returned status code 400 to indicate a bad request.
