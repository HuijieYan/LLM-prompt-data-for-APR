The error occurs when the `accept_connection` method is called. It seems that the `_abort` method is called before the handshake, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to close `self.stream`, which does not exist yet.

To fix this issue, the `_abort` method should be modified to check for the existence of `self.stream` before trying to close it. Additionally, since the error message indicates that the `accept_connection` method raises a ValueError for missing/invalid WebSocket headers, we should ensure that the `self._handle_websocket_headers` method handles this scenario properly.

The `_abort` method can be modified as follows:
```python
def _abort(self):
    if self.stream is not None:  # Check if self.stream exists
        self.stream.close()  # Close the stream if it exists
    self.ws_connection = None
```

Also, the `accept_connection` method should handle the ValueError raised by `_handle_websocket_headers` and should not call `_abort` if the ValueError occurs.

The corrected `accept_connection` method:
```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._send_error_response(400, str(e))  # Send 400 response for missing/invalid WebSocket headers
```

By handling the ValueError and sending a 400 response, we avoid calling `_abort` and ensure that the connection is not prematurely closed.

These modifications should address the AttributeError and ensure proper handling of missing/invalid WebSocket headers.

The corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:
```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._send_error_response(400, str(e))  # Send 400 response for missing/invalid WebSocket headers
```
