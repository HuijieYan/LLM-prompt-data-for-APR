The error occurs when the test case `test_missing_websocket_key` is run and the response code is expected to be 400 but is actually 500. This discrepancy indicates that there is an issue with the validation of required WebSocket headers.

Looking at the provided code, it seems that the bug is within the `accept_connection` method. The method is intended to handle WebSocket connections, but there is a bug in the exception handling where the `ValueError` is caught, logged, and then the method returns. However, this does not handle the connection properly.

The reason behind the bug is that when the required WebSocket headers are missing, the function should handle the error properly, but instead it logs the error and then later on, the disconnected socket will lead to an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the `accept_connection` method needs to be modified to properly handle the case where the required WebSocket headers are missing. The method should handle this error, abort the connection, and close the stream properly.

The corrected code for the `accept_connection` method is as follows:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        self._abort()
```

In this corrected code, once the `ValueError` is caught, the `self._abort()` method is called to properly handle the error and disconnect the websocket stream. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring and properly handle the error case.
