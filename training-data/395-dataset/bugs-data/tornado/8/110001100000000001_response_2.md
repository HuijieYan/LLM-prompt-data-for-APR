Potential Error:
The potential error in the `accept_connection` function is that it catches a `ValueError` exception, but then logs an error and returns without re-raising the exception. This means that any `ValueError` raised during the execution of `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` will be silently ignored, and the program will continue as if no error occurred.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` function is catching the `ValueError` exception but not handling it appropriately. Instead of logging an error and returning, the function should handle the exception and either continue with an alternative approach or re-raise the exception to be handled at a higher level.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` function should handle the `ValueError` exception appropriately. This could involve taking appropriate action based on the error condition, logging the error for debugging purposes, and/or re-raising the exception to be handled at a higher level.

Corrected Code:
```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        raise e  # Re-raise the exception after handling
```
