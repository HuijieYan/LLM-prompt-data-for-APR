The error message indicates that the expected response code is 400, but the actual response code is 500. This implies that there is an issue with the WebSocket connection and the `accept_connection` method is not handling it properly.

The potential error location is in the `accept_connection` method where it catches `ValueError` and returns without properly handling the error.

The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` method catches a `ValueError` but does not handle it properly. This leads to the WebSocket request being considered as malformed and the connection being aborted with a 500 response code instead of the expected 400 response code.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` method needs to properly handle the `ValueError` and return a 400 response code when a WebSocket request is considered as malformed.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:
```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        self.set_400_response()  # Set the response code to 400 for a malformed request
        return
```
In this corrected code, a new method `set_400_response` is called to set the response code to 400 when a malformed WebSocket request is encountered.
