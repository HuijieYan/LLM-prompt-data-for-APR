The error occurs when the `WebSocketProtocol13.accept_connection` function calls `WebSocketProtocol._abort` immediately if there are missing required headers. This is before the handshake, so there is no `self.stream` yet when the `_abort` function is called. The `_abort` function also calls `self.close()` without checking the nullity of `self.stream`, resulting in the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the `_abort` function should be modified to check the nullity of `self.stream` before calling `self.stream.close()`. Additionally, the `accept_connection` function should also be modified to handle the error more gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _abort(self):
    if self.stream:
        self.stream.close()  # forcibly tear down the connection
    else:
        gen_log.debug("self.stream is None")

def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        self.close()
        return
```

With these changes, the error checking for `self.stream` has been added to the `_abort` function, and the `accept_connection` function handles the error more gracefully.
