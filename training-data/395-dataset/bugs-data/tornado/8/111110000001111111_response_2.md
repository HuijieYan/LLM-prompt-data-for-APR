The error occurs in the `accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. The error message indicates that the `_abort` function is being called before the handshake, which results in trying to close a non-existent `self.stream` attribute. This leads to an `AttributeError` because `self.stream` is `None` at that point.

The bug occurs because the `accept_connection` function first calls `_handle_websocket_headers`, which raises a `ValueError` if specific headers are missing or invalid. Then, the `_accept_connection` function is called, but if the headers are missing or invalid, it should not proceed with the handshake.

To fix the bug, a `ValueError` should be explicitly raised, and the function should return early if the headers are missing or invalid, rather than trying to continue with the handshake.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` function:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
    self._accept_connection()
```

By raising the `ValueError` and returning early if the headers are missing or invalid, the bug should be resolved.
