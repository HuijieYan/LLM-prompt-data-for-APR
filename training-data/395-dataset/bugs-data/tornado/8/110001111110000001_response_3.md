1. The test case "test_missing_websocket_key" is trying to fetch the '/echo' endpoint with specific headers, and it expects the response code to be 400. However, the actual response code is 500, which indicates an internal server error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the "accept_connection" method where the WebSocket headers are handled and the connection is accepted.

3. The bug occurs because the exception handling in the "accept_connection" method only catches ValueError, but it does not handle the Internal Server Error (500) properly. As a result, when an error occurs during the WebSocket connection, it is not being properly handled, leading to a 500 response code.

4. To fix the bug, the "accept_connection" method should catch a broader range of exceptions to handle any errors that may occur during the WebSocket connection process. Additionally, the correct HTTP error code (400) should be returned when there is an issue with the WebSocket connection.

5. Here is the corrected code for the "accept_connection" method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except Exception as e:
        gen_log.debug("Error during WebSocket connection: %s" % str(e), exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        raise web.HTTPError(400, "Malformed WebSocket request received")
```
