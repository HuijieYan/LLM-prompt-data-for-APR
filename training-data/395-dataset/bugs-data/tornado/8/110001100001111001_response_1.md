The buggy function `accept_connection` is trying to handle websocket headers and then accept the connection using the `_handle_websocket_headers` and `_accept_connection` methods, respectively. However, it catches `ValueError` and logs a debug message before aborting the connection. 

The issue is that the `accept_connection` method is not raising a ValueError when it should be, and instead is catching it and handling it internally. This means that any ValueError that should be raised by `_handle_websocket_headers` or `_accept_connection` is being silenced, leading to potential issues with the websocket connection.

To fix this, the `accept_connection` method should not catch the ValueError internally, but instead allow it to propagate to the caller.

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    self._handle_websocket_headers()
    self._accept_connection()
```
By removing the try-except block and not catching the `ValueError`, the method now allows any ValueError raised by `_handle_websocket_headers` or `_accept_connection` to propagate up the call stack and be handled appropriately.
