The buggy function "accept_connection" seems to have an issue with exception handling. It catches a ValueError but does not handle it properly.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the function "accept_connection" is trying to handle WebSocket connections. However, it catches a ValueError when calling "self._accept_connection()" and then logs a debug message and aborts the connection without properly handling the error.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the ValueError properly by logging the error and aborting the connection. Additionally, it should consider using the specific exception related to WebSocket connections instead of a general ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the "accept_connection" function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except WebSocketError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received: %s" % e, exc_info=True)
        self._abort()
        return
```
