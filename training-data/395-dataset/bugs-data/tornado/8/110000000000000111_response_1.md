Based on the provided GitHub issue, it seems that the error occurs when the required WebSocket headers are missing, causing an AttributeError. The error message points to the _abort function calling self.stream.close() without checking if self.stream is null. Additionally, the _abort function also calls self.close(), which contains similar buggy code that calls self.stream.close() without checking for nullity.

To fix this bug, the _abort function should be modified to check for the existence of self.stream before attempting to close it. Similarly, the self.close() function should also be updated to check for the nullity of self.stream before closing it. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring when the required WebSocket headers are missing.

Here's the corrected code for the accept_connection function, including the updated _abort and self.close() functions:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError as e:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received", exc_info=True)
        self._abort(e)

def _abort(self, e):
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()
    self.close()

def close(self):
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.close()
    self.ws_connection = None
```
By checking for the existence of self.stream before attempting to close it, the AttributeError should no longer occur when the required WebSocket headers are missing.
