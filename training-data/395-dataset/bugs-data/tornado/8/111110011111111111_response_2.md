The test case `test_missing_websocket_key` is trying to verify the behavior of the server when the client misses a required header for the websocket handshake. The error message from the test function indicates that the response code is 500 when it should be 400.

The issue occurs in the `accept_connection` function of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. The `_handle_websocket_headers` function is responsible for checking the required headers, and if they are missing, it raises a ValueError. However, the `accept_connection` function catches the ValueError but does not handle it properly, leading to the server returning a 500 status code.

The reason behind the bug is that when the required headers are missing, the server should return a 400 status code, but instead, it returns 500 due to the mishandling of the ValueError in the `accept_connection` function.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` function should be modified to handle the ValueError properly and return the correct status code. The corrected code for the `accept_connection` function is as follows:

```python
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Malformed WebSocket request received",
                      exc_info=True)
        self.set_400()  # Set the response status code to 400
        self._abort()
        return
```

By setting the response status code to 400 using `self.set_400()`, the server will return the appropriate status code when the required headers are missing. This approach ensures that the server behaves as expected in the given test case and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
