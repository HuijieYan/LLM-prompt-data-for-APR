The error occurs in the `accept_connection` method of the `WebSocketProtocol13` class. The error is triggered when required headers for the WebSocket handshake are missing, causing the server to raise an AttributeError.

The bug occurs because the method does not handle the case where required WebSocket headers are missing. The `accept_connection` method immediately calls the `_abort` method, which tries to close `self.stream` even though it may not have been initialized yet.

To fix the bug, the `accept_connection` method should handle the case where required WebSocket headers are missing. Instead of immediately calling `_abort`, it should raise a ValueError and log the error message "Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers".

Here's the corrected code for the `accept_connection` method:

```python
# Corrected accept_connection method
def accept_connection(self):
    try:
        self._handle_websocket_headers()
        self._accept_connection()
    except ValueError:
        gen_log.debug("Missing/Invalid WebSocket headers", exc_info=True)
        raise
```

By raising a ValueError, the method can handle the case where required headers are missing and log the appropriate error message. This will prevent the AttributeError from being raised in the `_abort` method.
