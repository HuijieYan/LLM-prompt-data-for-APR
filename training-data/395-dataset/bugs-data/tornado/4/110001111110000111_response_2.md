The error that the test case is encountering is related to an incorrect Content-Type header being returned in the response. This indicates that the code is not handling the Range request properly, resulting in an unexpected response being sent back.

The potential error location is within the logic that handles the Range header in the "get" method of the class. Specifically, the calculation of "start" can lead to negative values if the requested range is invalid.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the requested range is invalid or the file size is smaller than the requested range. This leads to the incorrect calculation of the start and end positions for the content to be retrieved.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to properly handle invalid range requests and ensure that the start and end positions for content retrieval are calculated correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the "get" method:

```python
async def get(self, path: str, include_body: bool = True) -> None:
    # ... (previous code)

    if request_range:
        start, end = request_range
        if end and (end < 0 or (start and end <= start)):
            # Invalid range requested
            self.set_status(416)  # Range Not Satisfiable
            self.set_header("Content-Type", "text/plain")
            self.set_header("Content-Range", "bytes */%s" % size)
            return

        if start is None:
            start = 0
        if end is None:
            end = size - 1

        # Check if the requested range is satisfiable
        if end >= size:
            end = size - 1
            if start > end:
                # Invalid range requested
                self.set_status(416)  # Range Not Satisfiable
                self.set_header("Content-Type", "text/plain")
                self.set_header("Content-Range", "bytes */%s" % size)
                return

        # Set the status and headers for successful range request
        self.set_status(206)  # Partial Content
        self.set_header("Content-Range", "bytes %s-%s/%s" % (start, end, size))
    else:
        start = 0
        end = size - 1

    # Calculate content length and set Content-Length header
    content_length = end - start + 1
    self.set_header("Content-Length", content_length)

    # Retrieve and write the content
    if include_body:
        content = self.get_content(self.absolute_path, start, end)
        if isinstance(content, bytes):
            content = [content]
        for chunk in content:
            try:
                self.write(chunk)
                await self.flush()
            except iostream.StreamClosedError:
                return
    else:
        assert self.request.method == "HEAD"
```

In the corrected code, additional checks have been added to handle invalid range requests, and the start and end positions are calculated based on the requested range and file size. The Content-Type and Content-Range headers are set according to the RFC 2616 specification to properly handle range requests.
