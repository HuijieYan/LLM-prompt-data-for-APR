The issue occurs in the function `get` of the `StaticFileHandler` class. When a negative range is passed in the `Range` header, the code attempts to seek to a negative position in the file, resulting in an error from the operating system. The specific issue lies in the following line of code:
```python
if start is not None and start < 0:
    start += size
```
This code is not handling cases where the requested start position is negative, leading to the file seek operation attempting to move to a negative position, which is not supported.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `size` is smaller than `start` and, in that case, set `start` equal to `size`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` function of the `StaticFileHandler` class:

```python
async def get(self, path: str, include_body: bool = True) -> None:
    # Set up our path instance variables.
    self.path = self.parse_url_path(path)
    del path  # make sure we don't refer to path instead of self.path again
    absolute_path = self.get_absolute_path(self.root, self.path)
    self.absolute_path = self.validate_absolute_path(self.root, absolute_path)
    if self.absolute_path is None:
        return

    self.modified = self.get_modified_time()
    self.set_headers()

    if self.should_return_304():
        self.set_status(304)
        return

    request_range = None
    range_header = self.request.headers.get("Range")
    if range_header:
        # As per RFC 2616 14.16, if an invalid Range header is specified,
        # the request will be treated as if the header didn't exist.
        request_range = httputil._parse_request_range(range_header)

    size = self.get_content_size()
    if request_range:
        start, end = request_range
        if start is not None and start < 0:
            start = max(size + start, 0)  # Set start to 0 if it is negative
        if end == 0:
            # As per RFC 2616 14.35.1, a range is not satisfiable only if
            # the first requested byte is equal to or greater than the content
            self.set_status(416)  # Range Not Satisfiable
            self.set_header("Content-Type", "text/plain")
            self.set_header("Content-Range", "bytes */%s" % (size,))
            return
        if end is not None and end > size:
            end = size
        # Note: only return HTTP 206 if less than the entire range has been
        # requested. Not only is this semantically correct, but Chrome
        # refuses to play audio if it gets an HTTP 206 in response to
        # ``Range: bytes=0-``.
        if size != (end or size) - (start or 0):
            self.set_status(206)  # Partial Content
            self.set_header(
                "Content-Range", httputil._get_content_range(start, end, size)
            )
    else:
        start = end = None

    if start is not None and end is not None:
        content_length = end - start
    elif end is not None:
        content_length = end
    elif start is not None:
        content_length = size - start
    else:
        content_length = size
    self.set_header("Content-Length", content_length)

    if include_body:
        content = self.get_content(self.absolute_path, start, end)
        if isinstance(content, bytes):
            content = [content]
        for chunk in content:
            try:
                self.write(chunk)
                await self.flush()
            except iostream.StreamClosedError:
                return
    else:
        assert self.request.method == "HEAD"
```
By adding the check for `start` and updating it to a non-negative value if it is negative, we resolve the issue of seeking to a negative position in the file when a negative range is provided.
