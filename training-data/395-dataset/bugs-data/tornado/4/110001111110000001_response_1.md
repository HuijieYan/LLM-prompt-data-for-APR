The test case "test_static_unsatisfiable_range_end_less_than_start" is attempting to make a GET and HEAD request for the "/static/robots.txt" resource with a range that is unsatisfiable (end less than start). The expected behavior is that the server should respond with a 416 status code and a "Content-Range" header of "bytes */26".

The error message indicates a mismatch in the "Content-Type" header between the GET and HEAD requests. This suggests that the problematic function is not handling the range request and headers correctly.

The bug is likely occurring in the section of the "get" function that deals with range requests. It seems that the logic for handling the range and setting the appropriate headers might be incorrect, leading to a mismatch in the "Content-Type" header.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly handle range requests and set the appropriate headers according to the HTTP specifications.

Below is the corrected code for the "get" function:

```python
# ...

async def get(self, path: str, include_body: bool = True) -> None:
    # Set up our path instance variables.
    self.path = self.parse_url_path(path)
    del path  # make sure we don't refer to path instead of self.path again
    absolute_path = self.get_absolute_path(self.root, self.path)
    self.absolute_path = self.validate_absolute_path(self.root, absolute_path)
    if self.absolute_path is None:
        return

    self.modified = self.get_modified_time()
    self.set_headers()

    if self.should_return_304():
        self.set_status(304)
        return

    request_range = None
    range_header = self.request.headers.get("Range")
    if range_header:
        # As per RFC 2616 14.16, if an invalid Range header is specified,
        # the request will be treated as if the header didn't exist.
        request_range = httputil._parse_request_range(range_header)

    size = self.get_content_size()
    if request_range:
        start, end = request_range
        if (start is not None and start >= size) or end == 0:
            # As per RFC 2616 14.35.1, a range is not satisfiable only: if
            # the first requested byte is equal to or greater than the
            # content, or when a suffix with length 0 is specified
            self.set_status(416)  # Range Not Satisfiable
            self.set_header("Content-Type", "text/plain")  # Set the correct Content-Type
            self.set_header("Content-Range", "bytes */%s" % (size,))
            return
        if start is not None and start < 0:
            start += size
        if end is not None and end > size:
            # Clients sometimes blindly use a large range to limit their
            # download size; cap the endpoint at the actual file size.
            end = size
        # Note: only return HTTP 206 if less than the entire range has been
        # requested. Not only is this semantically correct, but Chrome
        # refuses to play audio if it gets an HTTP 206 in response to
        # ``Range: bytes=0-``.
        if size != (end or size) - (start or 0):
            self.set_status(206)  # Partial Content
            self.set_header(
                "Content-Range", httputil._get_content_range(start, end, size)
            )
        else:
            self.set_header("Content-Type", "text/plain")  # Set the correct Content-Type
            content_length = end - start if end is not None else size - start
            self.set_header("Content-Length", content_length)
    else:
        start = end = None

    if include_body:
        content = self.get_content(self.absolute_path, start, end)
        if isinstance(content, bytes):
            content = [content]
        for chunk in content:
            try:
                self.write(chunk)
                await self.flush()
            except iostream.StreamClosedError:
                return
    else:
        assert self.request.method == "HEAD"
