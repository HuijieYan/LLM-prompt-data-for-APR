# buggy class docstring

A simple handler that can serve static content from a directory.

A `StaticFileHandler` is configured automatically if you pass the
``static_path`` keyword argument to `Application`.  This handler
can be customized with the ``static_url_prefix``, ``static_handler_class``,
and ``static_handler_args`` settings.

To map an additional path to this handler for a static data directory
you would add a line to your application like::

    application = web.Application([
        (r"/content/(.*)", web.StaticFileHandler, {"path": "/var/www"}),
    ])

The handler constructor requires a ``path`` argument, which specifies the
local root directory of the content to be served.

Note that a capture group in the regex is required to parse the value for
the ``path`` argument to the get() method (different than the constructor
argument above); see `URLSpec` for details.

To serve a file like ``index.html`` automatically when a directory is
requested, set ``static_handler_args=dict(default_filename="index.html")``
in your application settings, or add ``default_filename`` as an initializer
argument for your ``StaticFileHandler``.

To maximize the effectiveness of browser caching, this class supports
versioned urls (by default using the argument ``?v=``).  If a version
is given, we instruct the browser to cache this file indefinitely.
`make_static_url` (also available as `RequestHandler.static_url`) can
be used to construct a versioned url.

This handler is intended primarily for use in development and light-duty
file serving; for heavy traffic it will be more efficient to use
a dedicated static file server (such as nginx or Apache).  We support
the HTTP ``Accept-Ranges`` mechanism to return partial content (because
some browsers require this functionality to be present to seek in
HTML5 audio or video).

**Subclassing notes**

This class is designed to be extensible by subclassing, but because
of the way static urls are generated with class methods rather than
instance methods, the inheritance patterns are somewhat unusual.
Be sure to use the ``@classmethod`` decorator when overriding a
class method.  Instance methods may use the attributes ``self.path``
``self.absolute_path``, and ``self.modified``.

Subclasses should only override methods discussed in this section;
overriding other methods is error-prone.  Overriding
``StaticFileHandler.get`` is particularly problematic due to the
tight coupling with ``compute_etag`` and other methods.

To change the way static urls are generated (e.g. to match the behavior
of another server or CDN), override `make_static_url`, `parse_url_path`,
`get_cache_time`, and/or `get_version`.

To replace all interaction with the filesystem (e.g. to serve
static content from a database), override `get_content`,
`get_content_size`, `get_modified_time`, `get_absolute_path`, and
`validate_absolute_path`.

   Many of the methods for subclasses were added in Tornado 3.1.
