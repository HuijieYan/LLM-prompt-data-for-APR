The problematic function is the `get` method inside the `StaticFileHandler` class. The bug seems to be related to the use of `await` inside a normal method, which is not allowed.

The `await` keyword can only be used inside an asynchronous function. This method is not marked as `async` and does not contain any asynchronous operations, so the use of `await` is incorrect and causing the bug.

To fix the bug, remove the `await` keyword from the `write` method call inside the `get` method and remove the `async` keyword from the method signature.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method:
```python
def get(self, path: str, include_body: bool = True) -> None:
    # ... existing code ...

    if include_body:
        content = self.get_content(self.absolute_path, start, end)
        if isinstance(content, bytes):
            content = [content]
        for chunk in content:
            try:
                self.write(chunk)
                self.flush()
            except iostream.StreamClosedError:
                return
    else:
        assert self.request.method == "HEAD"
```
