The test case "test_static_unsatisfiable_range_end_less_than_start" is trying to access a range of bytes in the file "/static/robots.txt" from 10 to 3, which is unsatisfiable because the end range (3) is less than the start range (10). The error message states that the Content-Type differs between the GET request and the HEAD request for the same file.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the range header. When the start range is negative and greater than the size of the file, the function tries to seek to a negative position in the file, causing an OSError.

The bug occurs because the code only checks if the start range is less than 0, and if so, it adds the file size to the start range. It does not handle the case where the file size is smaller than the start range.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to check if the size is smaller than the start range and set the start range to size in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def get(self, path: str, include_body: bool = True) -> None:
    # Set up our path instance variables.
    self.path = self.parse_url_path(path)
    del path  # make sure we don't refer to path instead of self.path again
    absolute_path = self.get_absolute_path(self.root, self.path)
    self.absolute_path = self.validate_absolute_path(self.root, absolute_path)
    if self.absolute_path is None:
        return

    self.modified = self.get_modified_time()
    self.set_headers()

    if self.should_return_304():
        self.set_status(304)
        return

    request_range = None
    range_header = self.request.headers.get("Range")
    if range_header:
        # As per RFC 2616 14.16, if an invalid Range header is specified,
        # the request will be treated as if the header didn't exist.
        request_range = httputil._parse_request_range(range_header)

    size = self.get_content_size()
    if request_range:
        start, end = request_range
        if (start is not None and start >= size) or end == 0:
            # As per RFC 2616 14.35.1, a range is not satisfiable only: if
            # the first requested byte is equal to or greater than the
            # content, or when a suffix with length 0 is specified
            self.set_status(416)  # Range Not Satisfiable
            self.set_header("Content-Type", "text/plain")
            self.set_header("Content-Range", "bytes */%s" % (size,))
            return
        if start is not None and start < 0:
            start = max(0, start + size)  # Adjust start range if negative
        if end is not None and end > size:
            # Clients sometimes blindly use a large range to limit their
            # download size; cap the endpoint at the actual file size.
            end = size
        # Note: only return HTTP 206 if less than the entire range has been
        # requested. Not only is this semantically correct, but Chrome
        # refuses to play audio if it gets an HTTP 206 in response to
        # ``Range: bytes=0-``.
        if size != (end or size) - (start or 0):
            self.set_status(206)  # Partial Content
            self.set_header(
                "Content-Range", httputil._get_content_range(start, end, size)
            )
    else:
        start = end = None

    if start is not None and end is not None:
        content_length = end - start
    elif end is not None:
        content_length = end
    elif start is not None:
        content_length = size - start
    else:
        content_length = size
    self.set_header("Content-Length", content_length)

    if include_body:
        content = self.get_content(self.absolute_path, start, end)
        if isinstance(content, bytes):
            content = [content]
        for chunk in content:
            try:
                self.write(chunk)
                await self.flush()
            except iostream.StreamClosedError:
                return
    else:
        assert self.request.method == "HEAD"
