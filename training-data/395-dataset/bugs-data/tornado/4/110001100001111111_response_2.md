The issue is occurring due to the code segment that handles the case when a negative range is passed in the Range header. When a negative range is provided, the code attempts to seek to a negative position in the file, which results in an error from the operating system.

To resolve this issue, the code should be modified to handle the case where the requested range is negative and the size of the file is smaller than the requested range.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def get(self, path: str, include_body: bool = True) -> None:
    # Set up our path instance variables.
    self.path = self.parse_url_path(path)
    del path  # make sure we don't refer to path instead of self.path again
    absolute_path = self.get_absolute_path(self.root, self.path)
    self.absolute_path = self.validate_absolute_path(self.root, absolute_path)
    if self.absolute_path is None:
        return

    self.modified = self.get_modified_time()
    self.set_headers()

    if self.should_return_304():
        self.set_status(304)
        return

    request_range = None
    range_header = self.request.headers.get("Range")
    if range_header:
        # As per RFC 2616 14.16, if an invalid Range header is specified,
        # the request will be treated as if the header didn't exist.
        request_range = httputil._parse_request_range(range_header)

    size = self.get_content_size()
    if request_range:
        start, end = request_range
        if start < 0:
            start = max(size + start, 0)  # Adjust start if it's negative
        end = min(end, size)  # Adjust end if it exceeds the file size
        if start >= size or end <= start:
            # If the adjusted range is invalid, return a 416 error
            self.set_status(416)  # Range Not Satisfiable
            self.set_header("Content-Type", "text/plain")
        else:  # Valid range
            self.set_status(206)  # Partial Content
            self.set_header("Content-Range", httputil._get_content_range(start, end - 1, size))
    else:  # No range is requested
        start = None
        end = None

    content_length = end - start if end is not None and start is not None else size
    self.set_header("Content-Length", content_length)

    if include_body:
        content = self.get_content(self.absolute_path, start, end)
        if isinstance(content, bytes):
            content = [content]
        for chunk in content:
            try:
                self.write(chunk)
                await self.flush()
            except iostream.StreamClosedError:
                return
    else:
        assert self.request.method == "HEAD"
```

In the corrected code, the start position is adjusted if it's negative, and the end position is adjusted if it exceeds the file size. Additionally, if the adjusted range is invalid, a 416 error is returned. If the range is valid, a 206 Partial Content status is set, and the Content-Range header is updated accordingly. Finally, the Content-Length header is set based on the adjusted range or the entire file size, and the content is written if include_body is True.
