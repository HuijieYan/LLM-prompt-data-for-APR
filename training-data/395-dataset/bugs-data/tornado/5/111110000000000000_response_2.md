    Schedules the given callback to be called periodically.
    
    The callback is called every ``callback_time`` milliseconds.

    time-related functions in Tornado use seconds.
    
    If the callback runs for longer than ``callback_time`` milliseconds,
    subsequent invocations will be skipped to get back on schedule.
    
    `start` must be called after the `PeriodicCallback` is created.
