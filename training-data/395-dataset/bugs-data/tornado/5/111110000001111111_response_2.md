## Analysis
The buggy function `_update_next` is supposed to calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. It seems to be using the wrong logic for updating the next timeout, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be with the calculation of the new next timeout using the current time and callback time.

## Bug Reason
The bug occurs because the calculation of the new next timeout is based on incorrect logic, resulting in frequent execution or skipping of invocations.

## Possible Approaches
1. Update the logic for calculating the new next timeout based on the current time and callback time.
2. Use the correct formula to calculate the next timeout, ensuring that subsequent invocations are scheduled correctly.

## Corrected Code
```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            intervals = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += intervals * callback_time_sec
```
In the corrected code, the logic for updating the next timeout has been fixed to use the correct formula for calculating the intervals and updating the next timeout based on the current time and callback time. This should address the issue of frequent execution or skipping of invocations.
