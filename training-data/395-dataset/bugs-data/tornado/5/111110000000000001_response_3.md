Potential error location:
The potential error in the function `_update_next` is the calculation of `self._next_timeout`. It seems that the calculation logic is not accurately maintaining the next timeout.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the calculation for updating the next timeout is not correctly handling the time interval for the periodic callback. This can result in subsequent invocations being skipped or not being accurately scheduled.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we can adjust the calculation logic to accurately determine the next timeout based on the current time and the callback_time. It's important to ensure that the next timeout is properly updated so that subsequent invocations are scheduled correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
            next_timeout_delta = (math.floor(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
            self._next_timeout = current_time + next_timeout_delta
```
