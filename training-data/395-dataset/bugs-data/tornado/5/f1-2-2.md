# buggy class docstring

```text
Schedules the given callback to be called periodically.

The callback is called every ``callback_time`` milliseconds.
Note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, while most other
time-related functions in Tornado use seconds.

If the callback runs for longer than ``callback_time`` milliseconds,
subsequent invocations will be skipped to get back on schedule.

`start` must be called after the `PeriodicCallback` is created.

.. versionchanged:: 5.0
   The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.
