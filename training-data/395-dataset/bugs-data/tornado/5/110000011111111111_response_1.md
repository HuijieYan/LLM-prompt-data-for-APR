The test case `test_clock_backwards` simulates a scenario where the `PeriodicCallback` class is used to schedule and run callbacks at specific intervals. The test case expects the callback to be executed at regular intervals based on the input parameters. However, the actual behavior of the function does not match the expected results, as indicated by the error message.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the issue is with the calculation of the `_next_timeout` value within the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class. The function is intended to update the next timeout based on the current time and the callback duration, but it fails to do so correctly in some cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is related to the calculation of the `_next_timeout` value. The incorrect calculation leads to deviations from the expected callback execution times, causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `_next_timeout` is updated accurately based on the current time and the callback duration. Additionally, any conversion between different units of time should also be handled appropriately to avoid discrepancies in the calculation.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the `_update_next` method to accurately calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback duration. This can be achieved by performing the necessary arithmetic operations while considering any unit conversions.

Based on the analysis and potential fix approach, the corrected code for the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class is provided below:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback:
    # other methods and attributes

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0  # convert callback time to seconds
            time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
            intervals_completed = math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (intervals_completed + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected code, the `_update_next` method properly calculates the next timeout based on the current time and the callback duration. It also handles any necessary conversions between different units of time to ensure accurate scheduling of the callbacks.
