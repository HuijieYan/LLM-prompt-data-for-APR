The error occurs in the `test_clock_backwards` test case. The test expects specific timestamps to be returned by the `simulate_calls` function when it is provided with a `PeriodicCallback` object and a list of time jumps as input. However, the actual output does not match the expected output, leading to an `AssertionError`.

The potential error location within the `_update_next` method is the calculation of the next timeout. It seems that the calculation is not handling negative time differences properly, which is causing the discrepancy in the test results.

The bug occurs because the `_update_next` method does not account for negative time differences when updating the next timeout. This causes the periodic callback to drift out of sync with the expected schedule, as observed in the failing test case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the calculation of the next timeout to properly handle negative time differences. This can be achieved by first converting the time differences to positive values before applying the calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... other code ...

    # corrected _update_next method
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_diff = abs(current_time - self._next_timeout)
            next_call_count = math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (next_call_count * callback_time_sec)
```

With this correction, the calculation of the next timeout takes into account negative time differences, ensuring that the periodic callback schedule remains accurate even when there are backward jumps in time.
