The error message is showing that the expected output is different from the actual output when the `simulate_calls` method is called with the `pc` object and a list of time intervals. The expected output is `[1010, 1020, 1030, 1040, 1050]` but the actual output is `[1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0]`.

The bug is likely located in the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class, where there seems to be a miscalculation that causes the time intervals to not be updated properly.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_update_next` method is not calculating the next timeout properly, which is causing incorrect time intervals and resulting in the wrong output during the test case execution.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to modify the calculation of `_next_timeout` in the `_update_next` method to ensure that it accurately reflects the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method with the bug fixed:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback:
    def __init__(self, callback, callback_time):
        self.callback = callback
        self.callback_time = callback_time
        self._next_timeout = 0
    
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            intervals_passed = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + intervals_passed * callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected code, I used `math.ceil` instead of `math.floor` to calculate how many intervals have passed based on the current time and the `_next_timeout`. Then, I used this information to update the `_next_timeout` to reflect the accurate next timeout.
