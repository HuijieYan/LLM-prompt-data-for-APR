Potential error location: The potential error in the _update_next function is the calculation of self._next_timeout. 

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect calculation of the next timeout value. It seems that the calculation may not be updating the next timeout properly, which could cause subsequent invocations to be skipped.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the calculation of self._next_timeout and ensure that it properly updates the next timeout value based on the current time and callback_time.
2. Validate the formula used to calculate the next timeout and make necessary adjustments to ensure it functions as intended.
3. Consider refactoring the code to make the calculation of next timeout more clear and robust.

Corrected code:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            increments = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += (increments if increments > 1 else 1) * callback_time_sec
```
