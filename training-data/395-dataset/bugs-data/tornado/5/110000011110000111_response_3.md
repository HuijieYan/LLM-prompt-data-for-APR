The test case 'test_clock_backwards' is failing with an AssertionError. The expected and actual results are not matching. The first differing element is at index 1, where 1010.0 is expected, but 1020 is the actual value.

The potential error location is within the `_update_next` method, where the calculation for the next timeout is being performed.

The bug occurs because the calculation `(math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec` is not correctly computing the next timeout value.

To fix this bug, we need to update the calculation for the next timeout in the `_update_next` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class ClassName:
    # other methods...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
            if time_diff > callback_time_sec:
                self._next_timeout += math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec
            else:
                self._next_timeout += callback_time_sec

```

In the updated code, we calculate the time difference and then use `math.ceil` to calculate the next timeout value. This ensures that the next timeout value is correctly computed even for backwards jumps.
