The potential error in the provided function is that the calculation of the next timeout using the callback time is not accurately considering the current time. The calculation is based on the assumption that the current time will always be greater than the next timeout, which may not be true in all cases.

The function is designed to calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. However, the current implementation is not handling the case when the current time is less than the next timeout.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check whether the current time is less than the next timeout before performing the calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        num_intervals = max(0, math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1)
        self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + num_intervals * callback_time_sec
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the calculation of the next timeout is only done when the current time is greater than or equal to the next timeout. We also used the max function to ensure that the number of intervals is at least 0, preventing negative values from being added to the next timeout.
