The error message provided indicates that the expected output from the test function is not matching the actual output. This suggests that the `_update_next` function is not functioning correctly, causing the `PeriodicCallback` to execute at incorrect times.

The potential error location within the `_update_next` function is the calculation of the next timeout:
```python
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

The bug occurs because the calculation of the next timeout is not taking into account the potential time jumps or adjustments in the system time, which results in the `PeriodicCallback` executing at incorrect times.

To fix this, the function should be modified to account for potential time adjustments and calculate the next timeout accurately based on the current time and the callback time.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_callback_periods = math.ceil(elapsed_time / (self.callback_time / 1000.0))
        self._next_timeout += num_callback_periods * (self.callback_time / 1000.0)
```

In the corrected code, the `math.ceil` function is used to calculate the number of callback periods based on the elapsed time and the callback time. This ensures that the next timeout is accurately calculated, accounting for potential time adjustments and preventing the `PeriodicCallback` from executing at incorrect times.
