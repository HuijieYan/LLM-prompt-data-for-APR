The issue lies within the calculation of the `_next_timeout` within the `_update_next` function. The error message indicates that the expected output for the test case `test_clock_backwards` is not being met, which suggests that the `_next_timeout` calculation is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the `_next_timeout` does not consider the case where the current time is greater than the next timeout, which results in an incorrect update.

To fix the bug, we can modify the calculation of the `_next_timeout` to account for the case where the current time is greater than the next timeout. Additionally, we should also import the `math` module as it is being used in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_callback_intervals = max(0, math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec))
        self._next_timeout += num_callback_intervals * callback_time_sec
```

With this corrected code, the `_next_timeout` will be updated correctly, taking into account the case where the current time is greater than the next timeout. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the test case.
