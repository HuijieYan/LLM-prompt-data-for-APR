The error likely occurs in the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class. This method is intended to update the time of the next timeout, but it seems to be updating it incorrectly.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the next timeout does not take into account the possibility that the current time may have already passed the next timeout.

To fix the bug, modify the `_update_next` method to correctly calculate the next timeout based on the current time. Below is the corrected code:

```python
import math

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...
    # this is the corrected function
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            delay = self.callback_time
            next_timeout = self._next_timeout
            while next_timeout <= current_time:
                next_timeout += delay
            self._next_timeout = next_timeout
```

This corrected method uses a while loop to increment the `next_timeout` until it is greater than the current time, which will ensure it is correctly updated for the next invocation of the callback.
