The buggy function is `_update_next` in the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_5/tornado/ioloop.py`. The function seems to be incorrectly calculating the next timeout based on the current time.

The error message from the test function `test_clock_backwards` shows that the expected output and the actual output do not match. Specifically, the lists differ in the second element with values `1010.0` and `1020`. This indicates that the function is not producing the correct next timeout value when the input is negative.

The potential error location within the function is in the calculation of the next timeout using `callback_time_sec`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is only considering positive values while calculating the next timeout, resulting in incorrect outputs when negative values are provided.

To fix the bug, the function should consider both positive and negative values for the current time and calculate the next timeout accordingly. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the current time is equal to or less than the next timeout.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout < current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        self._next_timeout = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec + self._next_timeout

    # Handle case where current time is less than or equal to next timeout
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        self._next_timeout += callback_time_sec
```
