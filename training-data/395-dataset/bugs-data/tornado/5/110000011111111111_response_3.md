The error occurs because the function is not properly updating the `_next_timeout` value based on the current time and the callback time. This causes the test case to fail as the expected and actual values for `_next_timeout` do not match.

The potential error is in the calculation of the new `_next_timeout` value within the `_update_next` method.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the new `_next_timeout` does not properly account for the time passed since the last execution and the callback time. This leads to incorrect scheduling of the next callback execution.

To fix the bug, the `_update_next` method should be updated as follows:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_passed = current_time - self._next_timeout
        multipliers = math.ceil(abs(time_passed) / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout += multipliers * callback_time_sec
```

This updated method takes into account the time passed since the last execution and calculates the correct number of multipliers for updating the next timeout. This should address the scheduling issue and ensure that the next execution time is calculated correctly.
