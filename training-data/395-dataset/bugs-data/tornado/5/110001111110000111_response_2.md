The error occurs in the `test_clock_backwards` test function, where the expected and actual results do not match. This indicates that the `_update_next` function is not correctly calculating the next timeout.

The potential error location is within the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` function.

The bug occurs because the calculation of the next timeout is not correctly handling the potential delay or backward jumps. As a result, the periodic callback is executed more frequently and at incorrect times.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the calculation of the next timeout to handle backward jumps and delays accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_5/tornado/ioloop.py

import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        next_time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        if next_time_diff <= 0:
            self._next_timeout += math.ceil(abs(next_time_diff) / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec
        else:
            self._next_timeout += math.floor(next_time_diff / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec
```

In this corrected code, we have added a conditional statement to handle backward jumps or delays in the calculation of the next timeout. This should ensure that the periodic callback is scheduled accurately.
