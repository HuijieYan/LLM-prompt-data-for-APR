The error appears to be related to the `PeriodicCallback` function, specifically the `_update_next` method. The error message indicates that the list of expected values does not match the actual values, and the first differing element is at index 1.

Upon analysis, it seems that the issue may be related to the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` method. It appears that the logic for updating the next timeout may be incorrect, leading to the mismatch between expected and actual values.

The bug occurred due to incorrect calculations of the next timeout in the `_update_next` method. The calculation should determine when the next timeout should occur based on the current time and the callback time, but it seems that the current logic is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for calculating the next timeout in the `_update_next` method to ensure that it accurately determines when the next timeout should occur.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... previous code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_diff = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += math.ceil((time_diff + 1) * callback_time_sec)
```

By making these changes, the `_update_next` method should now accurately calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time, addressing the issue in the test case.
