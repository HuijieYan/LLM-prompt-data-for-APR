The error occurs when the `simulate_calls` method is called on the `PeriodicCallback` object with a list of negative and zero values. The `simulate_calls` method is expected to produce a list of timestamps for when the callback should be called. However, it is not producing the expected values.

Upon analyzing the `_update_next` method within the `PeriodicCallback` class, it seems that the bug may be occurring because the logic for updating the next timeout value is incorrect. It appears that the function is not adjusting the next timeout correctly when negative time values are encountered.

The reason behind the bug could be that the current implementation does not handle negative or zero values in the list of time differences correctly. As a result, the timestamps for when the callback should be called are not being calculated accurately.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `_update_next` method to correctly handle negative and zero time differences. The method should calculate the next timeout value based on the current time and the callback time, ensuring that it accurately schedules the next invocation of the callback.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # Corrected _update_next method
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
            num_intervals = math.ceil(abs(time_diff) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_intervals * callback_time_sec)
```

With this correction, the `_update_next` method should handle negative and zero time differences correctly, resulting in the generation of the expected timestamps when `simulate_calls` is called.
