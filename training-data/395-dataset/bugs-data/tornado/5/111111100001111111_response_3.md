The issue is with the `_update_next` function inside the `PeriodicCallback` class. The function is responsible for updating the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. It seems to be designed to skip timeouts if the callback takes longer than the specified callback time.

The bug occurs because the function `_update_next` is not correctly updating the `self._next_timeout`. It is supposed to handle the case where the current time is greater than or equal to the next timeout, but it's updating the next timeout incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `_update_next` function needs to be corrected. Instead of directly adding the callback time to the next timeout, it should calculate the number of times the callback should have been called during the time gap and adjust the next timeout accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... other code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            gaps = (current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec
            if gaps < 1:
                self._next_timeout += (math.ceil(abs(gaps)) * callback_time_sec)
            else:
                next_timeout_gaps = math.ceil(gaps)
                self._next_timeout += (next_timeout_gaps * callback_time_sec)
```

This corrected code properly calculates the number of gaps and adjusts the next timeout accordingly, ensuring that it aligns with the intended behavior of the callback mechanism.
