The error message is failing because the lists of expected and actual values do not match. The expected list is [1010, 1020, 1030, 1040, 1050], but the actual list is [1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0, 1010.0]. This indicates that the actual values are not being calculated correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of the next timeout. It seems that the calculation is not taking into account the current time and the callback time correctly, resulting in incorrect values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to an incorrect calculation of the next timeout, leading to incorrect callback times.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to correct the calculation of the next timeout by ensuring that it appropriately takes into account the current time and the callback time.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        next_callback = math.ceil(diff / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec
        self._next_timeout = current_time + next_callback
```
