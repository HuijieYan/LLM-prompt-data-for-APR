Based on the error message from the test function, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` method. The test is expecting specific values for the next timeouts, but the actual values are different, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `_update_next` method is the calculation of the next timeout. It seems that the current calculation is not producing the expected results.

The bug is occurring because the calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` method is not accurately predicting the next timeout based on the current time and callback time.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the next timeout calculation accurately reflects the current time and the callback time. This may involve adjusting the algorithm used for calculating the next timeout.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        next_callback_count = math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout += next_callback_count * callback_time_sec
```

The corrected code uses `math.ceil` to round up the result of the division, ensuring that the next callback count is calculated accurately based on the time difference and the callback time.
