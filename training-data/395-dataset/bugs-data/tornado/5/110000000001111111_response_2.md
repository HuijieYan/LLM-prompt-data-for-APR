The problem with the provided function is that it doesn't update the next timeout correctly based on the current time and the callback interval. The function is using incorrect floating point logic for updating the next timeout.

The error occurs because the time calculations are incorrect, and the function is not updating the next timeout based on the current time and the callback interval.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the next timeout using integer arithmetic rather than floating point. This will prevent precision issues and ensure that the next timeout is updated correctly.
2. Use the correct formula to calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback interval.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import math

# this is the corrected function
def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec) + 1
        self._next_timeout += num_intervals * self.callback_time
```

This corrected function will accurately update the next timeout based on the current time and the callback interval, ensuring that the PeriodicCallback executes at the correct intervals.
