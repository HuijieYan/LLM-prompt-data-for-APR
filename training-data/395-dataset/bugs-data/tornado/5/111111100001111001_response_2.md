Potential error location: The calculation of the next timeout in the `_update_next` function is not producing the correct result.

Reason for the bug: The calculation for `_next_timeout` is not taking into account the difference between the current time and the last timeout.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of using the current_time directly, we should calculate the elapsed time since the last timeout and use that in the calculation of the next timeout.

Corrected code:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
        self._next_timeout += math.ceil(elapsed_time / self.callback_time) * self.callback_time / 1000.0
```
