The test case provided in the GitHub issue details a problem with the `PeriodicCallback` in the Tornado library executing too often on Windows. The function in question is `_update_next` which calculates the next timeout for the periodic callback.

The potential error location within the `_update_next` function is in the calculation of the next timeout. It seems that the calculation is not properly adjusting for the difference between the current time and the next timeout.

The reason behind the bug might be that the calculation of the next timeout is not properly accounting for the time elapsed since the previous timeout.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to re-evaluate the logic for calculating the next timeout, considering the difference between the current time and the previous timeout.

Here is the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:
```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout += num_intervals * callback_time_sec
```
In the corrected code, the time difference between the current time and the previous timeout is properly calculated and used to adjust the next timeout. This should address the issue of the periodic callback executing too often on Windows.
