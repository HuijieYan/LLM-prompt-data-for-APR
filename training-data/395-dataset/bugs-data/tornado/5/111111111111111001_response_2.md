The bug seems to occur in the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class. The issue is likely related to the conversion of the `callback_time` from milliseconds to seconds, and the subsequent addition of this converted value to `_next_timeout`.

The problem is likely due to the inconsistent use of integer and float values in the calculations. In some cases, the `callback_time_sec` is treated as a float, while `_next_timeout` is an integer. This inconsistency leads to incorrect rounding and addition, resulting in inaccurate scheduling of the callback.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure consistent usage of either integers or floats in the calculations. Converting all relevant values to the same type before performing arithmetic operations can help resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (other code)

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            self._next_timeout += int((math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec)
```

In the corrected code, the result of the entire calculation is converted back to an integer using the `int()` function. This ensures that the result is consistent with the type of `_next_timeout` and maintains accuracy in scheduling the callback.
