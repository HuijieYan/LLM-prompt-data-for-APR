1. The test case is checking the behavior of the `PeriodicCallback` class when it encounters backward jumps in time. The `simulate_calls` method is used to simulate calls to the `PeriodicCallback` and compare the expected results with the actual results.

2. The potential error location within the `PeriodicCallback` class is the `_update_next` method. This method is responsible for updating the next timeout based on the current time and callback time.

3. The bug occurs because the `_update_next` method does not correctly handle backward jumps in time. When the current time is less than or equal to the next timeout, the calculation for the next timeout is incorrect, leading to unexpected callback execution times.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_update_next` method to correctly handle backward jumps in time and calculate the next timeout based on the callback time and the current time.

5. The corrected code for the `_update_next` method is as follows:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            elapsed_time_sec = (current_time - self._next_timeout) / 1000.0

            # Calculate the number of callback intervals that have passed
            intervals_passed = math.floor(elapsed_time_sec / callback_time_sec)

            # Update the next timeout based on the elapsed time and callback time
            self._next_timeout += (intervals_passed + 1) * self.callback_time
```

By incorporating the logic to calculate the number of intervals passed and updating the next timeout based on the elapsed time and callback time, the issue with incorrect callback execution times due to backward jumps in time should be resolved.
