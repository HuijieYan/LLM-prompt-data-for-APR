The error is occurring in the _update_next method of the ioloop.py file. The method contains a calculation for the next timeout, which seems to be causing the periodic callback to execute too frequently on Windows.

The issue seems to be with the calculation of the next timeout. The current implementation is not handling the timing correctly, leading to the execution of the callback more frequently than expected.

To fix this issue, the calculation for the next timeout needs to be adjusted to ensure that the callback is executed at the correct intervals based on the provided schedule.

Here's the corrected code for the _update_next method:

```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout += num_intervals * callback_time_sec
```

This updated code calculates the time difference between the current time and the next timeout, then calculates the number of intervals based on the callback time. Finally, it updates the next timeout based on the calculated intervals. This should fix the issue of the periodic callback executing too frequently on Windows.
