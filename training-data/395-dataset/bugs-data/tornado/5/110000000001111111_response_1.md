The problematic part of the function is the calculation of the next timeout. It seems to be incorrectly calculated, leading to the function being called more often than expected.

The _update_next function is supposed to calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time, and update the value of _next_timeout accordingly. However, it seems to be incorrectly updating the _next_timeout value in some cases.

The issue with the function seems to stem from the calculation of the next timeout using the formula:
```python
self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```
The calculation is meant to determine the next timeout based on the current time, the previous timeout, and the callback time. However, the formula may not be accurately capturing the necessary time adjustments.

To fix the bug, we can revise the calculation in the _update_next function to ensure that the next timeout is correctly calculated based on the current time and callback time.

Here's the corrected function with the updated calculation:
```python
import math

def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        num_intervals = math.ceil(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
        self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_intervals * callback_time_sec)
```
In the updated function, we calculate the time difference between the current time and the previous timeout, then determine the number of intervals needed to reach the next timeout based on the callback time. Finally, we update the _next_timeout value accordingly.

This should address the issue of the function being called more frequently than expected.
