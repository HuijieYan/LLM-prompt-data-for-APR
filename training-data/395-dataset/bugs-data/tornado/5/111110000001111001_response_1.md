The bug in the `_update_next` function is that it's not correctly updating the `_next_timeout` value. The function is supposed to calculate the next timeout time based on the current time and the callback time, but the calculation is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly calculates the new `_next_timeout` value based on the difference between the current time and the previous `_next_timeout` instead of the current time and the original `_next_timeout`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the calculation of the new `_next_timeout` value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            num_periods = math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += (num_periods + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

In this corrected function, we use the `callback_time_sec` value to calculate the number of time periods that have passed since the last `_next_timeout`, and then add the appropriate multiple of `callback_time_sec` to update the next timeout time.
