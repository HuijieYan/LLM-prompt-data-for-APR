Potential error location: The calculation of the next timeout in the _update_next function seems to be the potential error location.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect calculation of the next timeout. It appears that the calculation is not taking into account the time passed and the callback time correctly, leading to potential skipping of subsequent invocations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the calculation of the next timeout takes into account the time passed and the callback time accurately. It's important to consider whether the callback time has elapsed multiple times since the last invocation and update the next timeout accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    """
    Schedules the given callback to be called periodically.
    
    The callback is called every ``callback_time`` milliseconds.
    Note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, while most other
    time-related functions in Tornado use seconds.
    
    If the callback runs for longer than ``callback_time`` milliseconds,
    subsequent invocations will be skipped to get back on schedule.
    
    `start` must be called after the `PeriodicCallback` is created.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.
    """

        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
        if elapsed_time >= self.callback_time:
            self._next_timeout = current_time
        else:
            num_skips = math.floor(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout += (num_skips + 1) * callback_time_sec
