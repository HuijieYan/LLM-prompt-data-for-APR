The function `_update_next` has a bug where the variable `callback_time_sec` is calculated as a float, but then the value of `_next_timeout` is accumulated as a float instead of an integer. This results in incorrect rounding and accumulated error over time.

To fix this bug, we should cast `_next_timeout` back to an integer after the calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_5/tornado/ioloop.py

# this is the corrected function
def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        self._next_timeout = int(self._next_timeout + (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec)
```

This modification cast the `_next_timeout` value back to an integer after the accumulation and ensures the correct rounding and accumulation over time.
