1. The test case is attempting to test the behavior of the `PeriodicCallback` class when handling backwards jumps in time. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output, specifically at element 1 of the lists.

2. The potential error location is within the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class.

3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect calculation or update of the `_next_timeout` property within the `_update_next` method. This results in inaccurate scheduling of the callback.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of the next timeout accounts for any backwards jumps in time. This can be achieved by appropriately adjusting the `_next_timeout` based on the current time and the callback interval.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback:
    def __init__(self, callback, callback_time):
        self.callback = callback
        self.callback_time = callback_time
        self._next_timeout = None

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout is None or self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout if self._next_timeout is not None else 0
            self._next_timeout = current_time + ((math.floor(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec)

    # The rest of the class methods...
```

In the corrected method, we handle the case where `_next_timeout` is `None` and also appropriately calculate the `_next_timeout` based on the elapsed time and callback interval. This should fix the bug and ensure accurate scheduling of the callback.
