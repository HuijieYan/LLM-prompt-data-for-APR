Potential error location: The _update_next function in the ioloop.py file is the potential error location.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the calculation of the next timeout in the _update_next function is incorrect, leading to the periodic callback executing too often on Windows.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the calculation of the next timeout to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.
2. Verify the usage of the callback_time and its relationship with the current_time to determine the correct next_timeout.
3. Consider using the appropriate mathematical operations to calculate the next timeout based on the current_time and callback_time.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import math

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_5/tornado/ioloop.py
def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        next_time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
        times_to_add = (math.floor(next_time_diff / callback_time_sec) + 1)
        self._next_timeout += times_to_add * callback_time_sec
```
