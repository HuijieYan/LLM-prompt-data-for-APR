The error in the provided function is caused by incorrect calculation of the `_next_timeout` value within the `_update_next` method. This method is a part of the `PeriodicCallback` class and is responsible for updating the next timeout value based on the current time.

The function uses the `callback_time` attribute, which represents the interval at which the callback should be called in milliseconds. However, the calculation of the next timeout value is incorrect due to the improper usage of the `math.floor` function.

The buggy function should be fixed by ensuring that the next timeout value is correctly calculated based on the current time and the callback interval.

Hereâ€™s the corrected function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_since_last = current_time - self._next_timeout
            num_intervals = max(1, math.ceil(time_since_last / callback_time_sec))
            self._next_timeout += num_intervals * callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected function, the time since the last timeout is calculated as `time_since_last`, and the number of intervals that have passed since the last timeout is determined using `math.ceil`. The next timeout value is then updated based on these calculations.

This modification ensures that the next timeout is correctly calculated based on the current time and the callback interval, addressing the issue of the periodic callback executing too often on Windows.
