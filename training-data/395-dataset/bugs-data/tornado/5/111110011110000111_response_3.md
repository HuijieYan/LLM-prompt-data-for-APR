The error message indicates that the simulated calls to the `PeriodicCallback` are not producing the expected results. The first differing element in the assertion failure is 1010.0 and 1020, which suggests that the calculations in the `_update_next` function are not accurate.

The potential error location is within the `_update_next` function, specifically in the calculation of the next timeout.

The bug occurs because the current logic does not properly handle the case when the current time is less than the next timeout. This causes subsequent invocations to drift away from the expected schedule, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the approach would be to check if the current time is less than the next timeout and calculate the next timeout accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            num_periods = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_periods * callback_time_sec)
```

With this correction, the `_update_next` function correctly handles the case when the current time is less than the next timeout, ensuring that subsequent invocations stay on schedule.
