The bug in the `PeriodicCallback` class's `_update_next` method is likely causing the error. The function is supposed to calculate the next timeout for the periodic callback, but the actual implementation is flawed.

The main issue in the current implementation is the incorrect calculation of the next timeout when the current time exceeds the next timeout. The formula for updating the next timeout seems to be incorrect, as it involves the current time, the previous next timeout, and the callback time.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The calculation for updating the next timeout should be revised to ensure that it accurately schedules the next callback based on the current time and the callback time.
2. The use of `math.floor` and adding a multiple of `callback_time_sec` should be reviewed to see if it accurately calculates the next timeout.

Here's the corrected code for the `PeriodicCallback` class's `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... other code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            intervals = (current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec
            if intervals < 1:  # If less than 1 interval has passed, move to the next interval
                self._next_timeout += callback_time_sec
            else:  # If multiple intervals have passed, calculate the new next timeout
                self._next_timeout += math.ceil(intervals) * callback_time_sec
```

By using `math.ceil` to round up the number of intervals and correctly updating the next timeout, this corrected code should resolve the issue with the periodic callback execution.
