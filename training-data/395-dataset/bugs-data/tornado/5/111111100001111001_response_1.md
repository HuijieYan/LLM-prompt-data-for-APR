The bug in the `_update_next` function arises from the incorrect calculation of the next timeout. The function doesn't handle the case where the current time is less than the next timeout, which results in the next timeout being incorrectly calculated.

To fix the bug, the function should calculate the time until the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time, and then add it to the current time to get the next timeout.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math
class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            intervals_passed = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (intervals_passed * callback_time_sec)
```
