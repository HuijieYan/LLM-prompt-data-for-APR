The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the next timeout in the `CronTabCallback` class. The function `_update_next` is responsible for updating the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. However, the current implementation of this function results in the next timeout getting ahead of the expected time.

The problem lies in the calculation of the `self._next_timeout` value. The function takes the current time, subtracts `self._next_timeout`, then divides the result by `callback_time_sec`, and then adds `1` and multiplies by `callback_time_sec`. This logic seems to be flawed, leading to the incorrect increment of `self._next_timeout`.

To fix this issue, the logic for calculating the next timeout should be modified. One approach could be to simply add the callback time to the current time to get the next timeout. This approach is simpler and more straightforward.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

# this is the corrected function
def _update_next(self, current_time):
    if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
        callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
        self._next_timeout = current_time + callback_time_sec
```

With this corrected logic, the issue with the `CronTabCallback` class should be resolved, and the next timeout should be calculated correctly.
