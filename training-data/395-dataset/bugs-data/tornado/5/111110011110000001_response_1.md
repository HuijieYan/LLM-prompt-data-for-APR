The test function `test_clock_backwards` is verifying the functionality of the `PeriodicCallback` class with a callback time of 10000 milliseconds. The error message indicates that the expected output and the actual output do not match.

Upon analyzing the error message, it appears that the issue is in the `simulate_calls` function which is called within the test function. The `simulate_calls` function doesn't seem to handle the adjustments of the time correctly, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual outputs.

The potential error location is the calculation of the `next_timeout` in the `_update_next` method of the `PeriodicCallback` class.

The bug is occurring because the calculation for `_next_timeout` is not accurate, causing discrepancies in the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug in the `_update_next` method, we need to recalculate the value of `_next_timeout` based on the current time and the callback time. 

Below is the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    """
    Schedules the given callback to be called periodically.
    
    The callback is called every ``callback_time`` milliseconds.
    Note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, while most other
    time-related functions in Tornado use seconds.
    
    If the callback runs for longer than ``callback_time`` milliseconds,
    subsequent invocations will be skipped to get back on schedule.
    
    `start` must be called after the `PeriodicCallback` is created.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 5.0
       The ``io_loop`` argument (deprecated since version 4.1) has been removed.
    """

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            time_diff = current_time - self._next_timeout
            
            if time_diff < 0:
                time_diff = 0  # Handle negative time differences
            
            num_intervals = math.floor(time_diff / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + (num_intervals + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

The corrected `_update_next` method now properly calculates the time differences and adjusts the `_next_timeout` value accordingly.
