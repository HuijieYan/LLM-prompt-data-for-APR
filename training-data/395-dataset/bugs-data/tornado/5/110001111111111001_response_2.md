The test case `test_clock_backwards` is comparing the expected output with the actual output from the `simulate_calls` function. The error message indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output. Specifically, the second element in the actual output is `1020` while the expected value is `1010.0`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation in the `_update_next` method, specifically where the next timeout is updated.

The bug occurs because the calculation to update the next timeout is performed using integer division and then multiplied by a float. This can result in inaccuracies, especially when the current time does not align perfectly with the callback time. As a result, the next timeout is not calculated correctly, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, the calculation should be performed using floating-point arithmetic to ensure accuracy in the next timeout computation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback:
    def __init__(self, callback, callback_time):
        self.callback = callback
        self.callback_time = callback_time
        self._next_timeout = 0

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            next_timeout_increment = math.ceil((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) * callback_time_sec
            self._next_timeout += next_timeout_increment
```

With this modification, the calculation for the next timeout is performed using floating-point arithmetic, ensuring accuracy and resolving the discrepancy between the expected and actual values.
