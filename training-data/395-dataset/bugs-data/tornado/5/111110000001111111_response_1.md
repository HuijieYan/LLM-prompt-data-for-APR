The `Buggy function` provided is the `_update_next` method inside the `PeriodicCallback` class. This method is meant to update the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time. However, due to a bug in the calculation, the function does not work as intended.

Upon analysis of the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the calculation of the next timeout. 

The `_update_next` method should update the `_next_timeout` by adding the `callback_time_sec` (converted from milliseconds to seconds) to the current `_next_timeout` until it exceeds the current time. However, there are inaccuracies in the existing calculation, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the calculation for updating the `_next_timeout` needs to be modified to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

Here is the corrected code for the `_update_next` method:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):

    # ... omitted code ...

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        while self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            self._next_timeout += callback_time_sec
```

In the corrected code, the `_update_next` method now utilizes a while loop to continuously add the `callback_time_sec` to the `_next_timeout` until it exceeds the current time. This ensures that the next timeout is updated correctly based on the specified callback time, as intended.
