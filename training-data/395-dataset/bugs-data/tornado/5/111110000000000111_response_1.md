The bug occurs in the `_update_next` function within the `PeriodicCallback` class. The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the next timeout, causing the callback to execute too often on Windows systems.

The reason behind the bug is that the calculation of the next timeout is not correctly adjusting for the time passed. As a result, subsequent invocations might occur too frequently.

One approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the calculation of the next timeout properly accounts for the time that has passed since the last invocation, and schedules the next invocation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (other code)

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            elapsed_time = current_time - self._next_timeout
            num_intervals = math.ceil(elapsed_time / callback_time_sec)
            self._next_timeout = self._next_timeout + num_intervals * self.callback_time
```

In the corrected code, we calculate the `elapsed_time` as the difference between the `current_time` and the `_next_timeout`. Then, we calculate the `num_intervals` required to adjust for the elapsed time, and update the `_next_timeout` accordingly. This should ensure that the callback is scheduled correctly and executes at the expected intervals.
