Looking at the buggy function, the issue seems to be with the calculation of the next timeout. The method is using `math.floor` and `callback_time_sec` to calculate the next timeout, where `callback_time_sec` is the `callback_time` divided by 1000.0. 

The bug occurs because the value of `self.callback_time` is an integer, while the division by `1000.0` converts the result to a float. This inconsistent data type leads to incorrect calculations in the formula for `_next_timeout`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the division result is always a float, and then update the `_next_timeout` accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback:
    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = float(self.callback_time) / 1000.0
            self._next_timeout += (math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec
```

By explicitly converting `self.callback_time` to a float before performing the division, we ensure that the calculations are consistent and the bug is fixed.
