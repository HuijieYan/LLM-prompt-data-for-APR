The problematic function is `_update_next` within the `PeriodicCallback` class. 

The function is intended to update the next timeout based on the current time, but it has a bug in its calculation. It uses the formula `(math.floor((current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec) + 1) * callback_time_sec` to calculate the next timeout, but the formula is incorrect and leads to incorrect results.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly calculates the next timeout based on the current time, resulting in the callback being called too often or not often enough.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly calculate the next timeout based on the current time and the callback time.

Here is the corrected code for the `_update_next` function:

```python
import math

class PeriodicCallback(object):
    # ... (other class code)

    def _update_next(self, current_time):
        if self._next_timeout <= current_time:
            callback_time_sec = self.callback_time / 1000.0
            intervals = (current_time - self._next_timeout) / callback_time_sec
            if intervals < 1:
                self._next_timeout += callback_time_sec
            else:
                self._next_timeout += math.ceil(intervals) * callback_time_sec
```

The corrected code uses the correct formula to calculate the next timeout based on the current time, ensuring that the callback is called at the appropriate intervals.
