# Corrected function

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_3/tornado/httpclient.py

# this is the corrected function
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if getattr(self, '_closed', False):
        return
    setattr(self, '_closed', True)
    instance_cache = getattr(self, '_instance_cache', None)
    if instance_cache is not None:
        if instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

The corrected function includes using `getattr` and `setattr` methods to access and modify class attributes and avoids directly accessing them as instance variables.

This should resolve the "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" issue reported in the test function.
