The error message indicates that the subprocess produced unexpected output, and it comes from the test_destructor_log function in the httpclient_test.py file. This function is part of the test suite for the tornado library and aims to test the destructor of the HTTPClient.

The potential error location within the buggy close method is in the conditional statement:
```python
if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
```
This line compares whether the instance cached in self._instance_cache is the same as the current self instance. If it's not the same, a RuntimeError is raised with the message "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache".

The reason behind this bug is that the comparison using 'is' checks for object identity, not equality. Since self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) returns an instance of AsyncHTTPClient, it may not be the same object instance as self.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be based on equality using '==' instead of 'is'.

The corrected code for the close method is as follows:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) != self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
