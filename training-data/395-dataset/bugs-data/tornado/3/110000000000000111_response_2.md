The potential error location within the problematic function is the `if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self` condition. This condition is checking if the current instance is in the instance cache associated with the IOLoop. If it's not, a RuntimeError is being raised.

The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" is occurring because the instance is not found in the instance cache associated with the IOLoop, indicating an inconsistency in the cache.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the instance is properly added to the instance cache when it is created, and to perform proper checks for the instance in the cache before raising a RuntimeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache and self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] is self:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
```
