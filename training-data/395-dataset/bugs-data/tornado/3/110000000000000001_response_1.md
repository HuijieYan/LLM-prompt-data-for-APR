The potential error location is the use of "self" as a parameter to the close method, which suggests that this is a method defined within a class.

The bug is caused by the fact that the close() function does not seem to be defined in a class, as it is missing the "self" parameter. In Python, methods within a class should have "self" as the first parameter to reference the instance of the class.

To fix the bug, we need to define the close method within a class and add the "self" parameter.

```python
class HTTPClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self._closed = False
        self._instance_cache = None
        self.io_loop = None

    def close(self) -> None:
        """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

        This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
        that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
        ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
        `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
        argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

        No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
        ``close()``.

        """
        if self._closed:
            return
        self._closed = True
        if self._instance_cache is not None:
            if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
