Potential error: The bug seems to be in the comparison `if self._instance_cache is not None`. It should be `if self._instance_cache is not None:` instead.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the comparison operator `is not` is not correct for checking if a variable is not None. The correct way to check for None is to use `if variable is not None:`

Approach for fixing the bug:
- Change the comparison operator from `is not` to `is not None`
- Add a colon after the if statement

Corrected code:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:  # Fixed the comparison operator and added a colon
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
