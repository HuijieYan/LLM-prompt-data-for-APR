Potential error location:
The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" indicates that there is an issue in the close method of the AsyncHTTPClient class.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the close method of the AsyncHTTPClient class does not handle the cleanup process properly. It is trying to access cached instances without checking for their existence, leading to the inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the instance cache exists before accessing it to prevent the RuntimeError.
2. Ensure that the instance cache is properly managed during the cleanup process.

Corrected code for the close method of the AsyncHTTPClient class:
```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None and self.io_loop in self._instance_cache:
        if self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
