The potential error in the given function is that it is not properly handling the operation of closing the HTTP client instance. The function is trying to check the `_closed` attribute and handle the cleaning up of resources, but it is not implemented correctly.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the cleanup operations when closing the HTTP client. It also does not handle the instance cache properly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly implement the cleanup process and handle the instance cache.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if not hasattr(self, '_closed') or self._closed:
        return

    self._closed = True
    if hasattr(self, '_instance_cache') and self._instance_cache is not None:
        if hasattr(self, 'io_loop') and self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
