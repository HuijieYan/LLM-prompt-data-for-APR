The bug seems to be related to the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class in the `tornado/httpclient.py` file. The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" indicates that there is an inconsistency in the cache of `AsyncHTTPClient` when the program is shutting down.

The issue seems to be that the `close` method is trying to interact with a cache (`self._instance_cache`) but does not handle the situation where the cache does not exist or has already been cleared.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the cache exists before attempting to access it.
2. Ensure that the cache is not already cleared before trying to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    `close()` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the `force_instance=True`
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    `close()`.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None and self.io_loop in self._instance_cache:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the cache exists (`self._instance_cache`) and if the `io_loop` is present in the cache before trying to access and modify it. This ensures that we do not encounter the "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" error when the cache does not exist or has already been cleared.
