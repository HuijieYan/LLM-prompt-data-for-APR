Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Tornado version: 5.1.1

Running the following code causes RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache

from tornado import httpclient


def f():
    pass


c = httpclient.HTTPClient()
Error log:

Exception ignored in: <bound method HTTPClient.__del__ of <tornado.httpclient.HTTPClient object at 0x7fef4def84a8>>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/████/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/httpclient.py", line 99, in __del__
  File "/████/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/httpclient.py", line 104, in close
  File "/████/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/simple_httpclient.py", line 139, in close
  File "/████/lib/python3.5/site-packages/tornado/httpclient.py", line 220, in close
RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache
Since the error is ignored, it may be harmless to the program. But the error message may confuse some new users, so I think it should be fixed.
```
