Potential error location: 
The error might be caused by self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) not returning the same instance of the AsyncHTTPClient object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison using "is not" is not checking for equality of the object, but rather if the objects are stored in different memory locations. This can lead to the RuntimeError being raised even if the objects are logically equal.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison to check for logical equality. We can also use the "in" keyword to check if the self.io_loop is in the self._instance_cache.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache and self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] == self:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
