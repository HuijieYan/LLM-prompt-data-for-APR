Potential error location:
The error occurs in the close() method of the AsyncHTTPClient class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs when the close() method of the AsyncHTTPClient class is called. It tries to remove the instance from the _instance_cache, but it does not check if the instance is already removed or if the cache is inconsistent, leading to the RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the instance is present in the cache before trying to remove it.
2. Verify the consistency of the cache and handle any inconsistencies before removing the instance.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.
    
    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.
    
    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.
    
    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache and self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] is self:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
