The bug in the `close` function of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class is causing a RuntimeError related to an inconsistent cache.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if self._instance_cache is not None:`. The reason for the bug is that the condition is checking if the `_instance_cache` attribute is not None, but it should be checking if `self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop)` is not None.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be updated to `if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:`.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` function:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
