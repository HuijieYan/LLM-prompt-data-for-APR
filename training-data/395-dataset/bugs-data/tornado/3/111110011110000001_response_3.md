The error message indicates that there is an "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" when the process is shutting down. This suggests that the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class might not be handling the cache and process shutdown scenario correctly, which is causing the inconsistent behavior.

The potential error location within the code is the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class.

The bug is likely occurring because the `close` method is not properly handling the removal of `AsyncHTTPClient` instances from the cache when the process is shutting down.

To fix the bug, the `close` method should handle the removal of instances from the cache and ensure that any associated resources are properly released.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None and self.io_loop in self._instance_cache:
        # Remove the instance from the cache if it exists
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

With the above change, the `close` method ensures that the instance is properly removed from the cache, if it exists, when the `close` method is called. This should prevent the "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" error when the process is shutting down.
