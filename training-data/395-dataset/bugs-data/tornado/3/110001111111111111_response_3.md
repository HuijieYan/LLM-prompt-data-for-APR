The issue reported is related to the `RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache` that occurs when using the `tornado` library in Python. The test case provided attempts to create an instance of `HTTPClient`, which triggers the `close` method to be called and leads to the RuntimeError.

The potential error within the `close` method is related to the handling of the instance cache. The bug occurs because the instance cache is not handled properly when the `close` method is called.

The reason behind the bug is that when the `close` method is called, it checks if the instance cache is not None and then attempts to remove the current instance from the cache. However, the instance is removed from the cache regardless of whether it exists, leading to the inconsistency in the cache.

To fix the bug, the `close` method should only remove the instance from the cache if it exists in the cache for the specific IOLoop. This will prevent the RuntimeError related to inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache.

Here's the corrected `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None and self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is self:
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

By making this change, the `close` method will only remove the instance from the cache if it exists in the cache for the specific IOLoop, preventing the RuntimeError related to inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache.
