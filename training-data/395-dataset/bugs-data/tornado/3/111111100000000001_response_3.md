The potential error in the close() function is that it's trying to access the attributes self._closed and self._instance_cache without initializing them in the __init__ method. This may cause an AttributeError if these attributes are not initialized before calling the close() method.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize these attributes in the __init__ method or wherever appropriate. We should also initialize self.io_loop since it's being used in the close() method but not initialized in the shown code.

Additionally, it's a good practice to call the super().__init__() method in the __init__ method of a subclass to ensure that any necessary initialization is performed from the parent class.

Corrected code for the close() method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if not hasattr(self, "_closed") or self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    
    if hasattr(self, "_instance_cache") and hasattr(self, "io_loop"):
        if self._instance_cache is not None:
            if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

In this corrected code, we've added checks using hasattr to ensure that the attributes _closed, _instance_cache, and io_loop exist before accessing them. And we've also initialized the _closed attribute within the close() method.
