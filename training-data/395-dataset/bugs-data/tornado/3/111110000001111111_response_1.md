The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that checks for inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache and raises a RuntimeError if the condition is met.

The bug occurs because the close() method is trying to access the instance_cache at self.io_loop which is not initialized anywhere in the provided code. This is causing the RuntimeError of "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" when the condition self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self is met.

To fix the bug, the close() method should be modified to handle the instance_cache properly.

The corrected code for the close() method is as follows:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if hasattr(self, '_instance_cache') and self._instance_cache is not None:
        if hasattr(self, 'io_loop') and self.io_loop is not None:
            if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
