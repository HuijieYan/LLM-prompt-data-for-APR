Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the check `if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:`

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may occur because the `self._instance_cache` is not initialized properly or the comparison logic is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that `self._instance_cache` is properly initialized before using it.
2. Use an alternative approach to check the consistency of the `AsyncHTTPClient` cache.

Corrected code:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache and self._instance_cache[self.io_loop] is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```
