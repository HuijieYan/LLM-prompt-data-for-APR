The error is occurring in the `close` function of the `AsyncHTTPClient` class. The error message "RuntimeError: inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" is indicating that there is an inconsistency in the cache of the `AsyncHTTPClient` object.

The potential error location within the `close` function is at the following line:
```python
if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
    raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
```

The bug occurs because the `close` method is not properly handling the instance cache. The `_instance_cache` is not being cleared properly or checked before closing the client, leading to inconsistencies in the cache.

To fix the bug, the `close` method should properly handle the instance cache by checking if the instance exists in the cache and then removing it before setting the client as closed.

Here's the corrected `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return

    self._closed = True

    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache:
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

With this correction, the `close` method will properly handle the instance cache, removing the instance from the cache before setting the client as closed.
