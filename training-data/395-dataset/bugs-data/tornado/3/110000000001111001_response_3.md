Potential error location: The error is likely being caused by the line `if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:`

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the `self._instance_cache` attribute is being accessed without being initialized first. This can lead to a `NoneType` error if the attribute has not been initialized.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by initializing the `self._instance_cache` attribute before accessing it.

Corrected code:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:  # Check if instance_cache is initialized
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
