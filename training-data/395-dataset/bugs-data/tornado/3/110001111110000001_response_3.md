The error message indicates that the subprocess produced unexpected output. The test function `test_destructor_log` is meant to be a regression test for a bug related to the HTTPClient destructor, but it seems to be failing due to unexpected output from the subprocess.

The issue may be related to the `close` method of the `HTTPClient` class. The `HTTPClient` class has a `close` method that is supposed to destroy the HTTP client and free any file descriptors used. However, the implementation of the `close` method contains a conditional statement that may be causing the issue. If the `_instance_cache` is not equal to `None`, and the `get` method of the `_instance_cache` does not return the current `io_loop`, a `RuntimeError` is raised. This may be the source of the unexpected output generated by the subprocess in the test function.

To fix this issue, the conditional check in the `close` method should be revised to ensure that the `None` check is performed first before attempting to access the `get` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return
    self._closed = True
    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self.io_loop in self._instance_cache.values():
            del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]
```

By checking if the `io_loop` is in the values of the `_instance_cache` instead of using the `get` method, we can avoid the potential `RuntimeError` and unexpected output from the test subprocess.
