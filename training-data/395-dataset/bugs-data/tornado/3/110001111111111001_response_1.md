The error message indicates an "inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache" error from a destructor when the process is shutting down. This suggests that the `close` method of the `AsyncHTTPClient` object is not functioning correctly.

The potential error location within the `close` method is the conditional check for the instance cache. The problem might be related to how the instance cache is being handled during the destructor call.

The bug occurs because the `close` method does not properly handle the instance cache when the `AsyncHTTPClient` is being destroyed. This causes an inconsistency in the cache, leading to the error message when the process is shutting down.

To fix the bug, the `close` method should properly handle the instance cache and ensure that it's removed when the `AsyncHTTPClient` is closed. Additionally, proper handling of the `self._closed` flag is needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `close` method:

```python
def close(self) -> None:
    """Destroys this HTTP client, freeing any file descriptors used.

    This method is **not needed in normal use** due to the way
    that `AsyncHTTPClient` objects are transparently reused.
    ``close()`` is generally only necessary when either the
    `.IOLoop` is also being closed, or the ``force_instance=True``
    argument was used when creating the `AsyncHTTPClient`.

    No other methods may be called on the `AsyncHTTPClient` after
    ``close()``.

    """
    if self._closed:
        return

    if self._instance_cache is not None:
        if self._instance_cache.get(self.io_loop) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("inconsistent AsyncHTTPClient cache")
        del self._instance_cache[self.io_loop]

    self._closed = True
```
