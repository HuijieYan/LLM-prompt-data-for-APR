The bug occurs because the `assert self.stream is not None` statement in the `set_nodelay` function results in an assertion failure. This happens because the `self.stream` attribute is not initialized properly, causing the assertion to fail when the `set_nodelay` function is called.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `self.stream` attribute is properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function. This can be done by checking if `self.stream` is not None before calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is not None:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

By adding the condition `if self.stream is not None:` before calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`, we ensure that the `set_nodelay` function will only be called when `self.stream` is properly initialized, preventing the assertion failure.
