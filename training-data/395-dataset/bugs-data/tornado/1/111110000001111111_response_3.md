The potential error location within the problematic function is the assertion `assert self.stream is not None`. This assertion is causing the function to fail.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the assertion is checking for the presence of `stream` before calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`. However, the `stream` attribute is not being set anywhere in the `set_nodelay` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `stream` attribute is set before calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`. This can be achieved by initializing the `stream` attribute in the `open` method of the WebSocketHandler class.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def open(self):
    self.stream = self.ws_connection.stream
    print("WebSocket opened")

def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.stream is not None
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

By initializing the `stream` attribute in the `open` method, we ensure that it is available and not None when the `set_nodelay` method is called. This should fix the assertion failure issue reported.
