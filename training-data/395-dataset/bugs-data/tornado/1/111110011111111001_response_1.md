The error occurs because the `set_nodelay` function has not been implemented correctly, and it is not setting the no-delay flag for the websocket connection, leading to delayed or combined messages.

The potential error location is within the `set_nodelay` function where it is not setting the no-delay flag properly, which is causing delays in message transmission.

To fix the bug, the `set_nodelay` function needs to be modified to correctly set the no-delay flag for the websocket connection.

Here is the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """
    Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent. This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs. To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call `self.stream.set_nodelay(True)` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.ws_connection:
        self.ws_connection.set_nodelay(value)
```

In the corrected code, we are setting the no-delay flag on the `self.ws_connection` object (which represents the websocket connection) using the `set_nodelay` method. Additionally, we are checking if `self.ws_connection` exists before calling the `set_nodelay` method to avoid potential errors.
