The error message from the test function indicates that the `res` value is `None` instead of 'hello', which means the `ws.read_message()` is not returning the expected value. 

The potential error location within the `set_nodelay` function is the line `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`.

The bug is occurring because the `set_nodelay` function is trying to set the nodelay flag on the `self.stream` object, but it seems that the `self.stream` is not the correct object to operate on. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `value` parameter is being passed to the correct object's `set_nodelay` method. 

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if isinstance(self, WebSocketProtocol13):
        assert self.ws_stream is not None
        self.ws_stream.set_nodelay(value)
    elif isinstance(self, NoDelayHandler):
        assert self.stream is not None
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

In the corrected code, we first check the type of `self` to determine whether it's an instance of `WebSocketProtocol13` or `NoDelayHandler`, and then call the appropriate stream's `set_nodelay` method based on the type of `self`. This will ensure that the nodelay flag is set on the correct object.
