The test case `test_nodelay` is trying to establish a websocket connection and read a message. However, the test is failing because the received message is `None` instead of "hello".

The potential error in the `set_nodelay` function is that it's not setting the nodelay flag correctly, which is causing delays in the websocket communication. This could be due to the incorrect handling of the `self.stream` object or the `value` parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the nodelay flag is set correctly in the `set_nodelay` function. This can be achieved by checking the type of `self.stream` and ensuring that it's not None before calling the `set_nodelay` method on it. Additionally, we need to properly handle the `value` parameter to set the nodelay flag accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent. This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs. To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    """
    if isinstance(self.stream, tornado.iostream.IOStream):
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid stream object")
