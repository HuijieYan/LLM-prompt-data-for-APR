The error occurs when the `test_nodelay` function tries to assert the value of `res` with "hello", but `res` is `None` instead of "hello".

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line:
`self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `set_nodelay` function is setting the nodelay value on the `stream` object, but it should be setting it on the `WebSocketProtocol13` object.

To fix the bug, the `set_nodelay` function should directly set the nodelay value on the `WebSocketProtocol13` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_1/tornado/websocket.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    assert self.ws_connection is not None
    self.ws_connection.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
