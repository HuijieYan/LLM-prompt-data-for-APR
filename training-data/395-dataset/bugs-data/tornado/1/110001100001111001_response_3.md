The bug in the provided code is that there are two identical functions with the same signature in the class, and one of them is redundant. The first function with the same signature should be removed.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.
    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.stream is not None
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
