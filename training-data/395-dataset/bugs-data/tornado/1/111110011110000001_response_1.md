The error message is showing that the expected result is "hello" but the actual result is None, indicating that the `read_message()` method is not returning the expected message.

The potential error location is within the `set_nodelay()` method of the `WebSocketHandler` class.

The reason behind the bug is that the `set_nodelay()` method is not properly setting the no-delay flag for the stream, which is affecting the communication between the client and the server.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `set_nodelay()` method properly sets the no-delay flag for the stream.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay()` method:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.stream is not None
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    self.stream.socket.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, value)
```

By adding the line `self.stream.socket.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, value)`, we ensure that the no-delay flag is properly set for the stream, which should fix the bug and allow the `read_message()` method to return the expected message.
