The bug in the provided function is that it is expecting a `stream` attribute within the `self` object, but it is not properly handling the `self` object passed to it. Additionally, it should be handling a `WebSocketProtocol13` object instead of a `NoDelayHandler` object.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to properly handle the `self` object and use the `WebSocketProtocol13` object to set the no-delay flag.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.ws_connection is not None  # Assuming ws_connection is the attribute holding the WebSocketProtocol13 object
    self.ws_connection.set_nodelay(value)
```

In the corrected function, I assumed that the `WebSocketProtocol13` object is stored in an attribute named `ws_connection`, so I updated the assertion and the method call accordingly. Make sure to replace `ws_connection` with the actual attribute name where the `WebSocketProtocol13` object is stored.
