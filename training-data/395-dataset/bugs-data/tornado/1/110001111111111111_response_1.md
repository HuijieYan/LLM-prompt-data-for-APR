Potential error location: The error occurs at the line `assert self.stream is not None` in the `set_nodelay` function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the `self.stream` attribute is not being properly initialized or set before the `set_nodelay` function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the initialization of the `self.stream` attribute in the WebSocketHandler class to ensure that it is properly set before calling the `set_nodelay` function.
2. If the `self.stream` attribute is not being set correctly, modify the initialization process to ensure that it is initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function.
3. Consider using a conditional check to handle cases where the `self.stream` attribute might not be set before calling the `set_nodelay` function.

Corrected code:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

        # This can be done by raising an error, logging a message, or any other appropriate action
