The error in the code is that the `set_nodelay` function is declared twice in the `WebSocketHandler` class. This would lead to a name conflict and would result in unexpected behavior.

It seems that the original intention was to override the `set_nodelay` function with a different signature. As it stands, the second declaration of `set_nodelay` is causing the issue.

To fix this, we need to remove the second declaration of `set_nodelay` and update the original function to accept the `ws_connection` parameter. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WebSocketHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # original set_nodelay function
    def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
        """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
        the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.

        See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

        assert self.stream is not None
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
