    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.
