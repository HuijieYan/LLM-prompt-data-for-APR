The potential error in the given code is that the `set_nodelay` function is defined twice within the `WebSocketHandler` class, which will result in a function redefinition error.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the `set_nodelay` function is defined both as a class variable and as a class method, which is redundant and incorrect.

To fix this bug, the redundant function definition needs to be removed, and the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function should be as follows:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.stream is not None
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
