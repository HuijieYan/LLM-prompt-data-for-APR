Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the assertion `assert self.stream is not None`. This assertion is expecting a `stream` attribute within the class, but it is not checking the specific attribute `ws_connection` which is likely the correct attribute to check.

Reason for the Bug: The buggy function is expecting a `stream` attribute to be present within the class, but the actual attribute to check is `ws_connection`.

Approaches to Fix the Bug: 
1. Update the assertion to check the correct attribute `ws_connection` instead of `stream`.
2. Update the function signature to include the correct parameter types.

Corrected Code:
```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    assert self.ws_connection is not None
    self.ws_connection.set_nodelay(value)
