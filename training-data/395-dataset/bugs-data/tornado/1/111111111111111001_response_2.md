The error message from the test function indicates that the value of `res` is `None`, but it is expected to be "hello". This suggests that the `on_open` method is not setting up the websocket properly, leading to the `read_message` method not receiving the expected message.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `set_nodelay` method. The current implementation of `set_nodelay` does not capture and handle the `ws_connection` properly, which may be causing the websocket connection to malfunction.

The reason behind the bug is that the `set_nodelay` method is not interacting with the websocket properly, potentially causing delays or issues with the websocket communication.

To fix the bug, you need to modify the `set_nodelay` method to properly handle the `ws_connection` and the `value` being passed in.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent. This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs. To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if hasattr(self, 'ws_connection') and hasattr(self.ws_connection, 'stream') and self.ws_connection.stream is not None:
        self.ws_connection.stream.set_nodelay(value)
    else:
        # Handle the case when ws_connection or its stream is not available
        raise ValueError("WebSocket connection or its stream is not available")
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `ws_connection`, `stream`, and `value` are handled properly. If any of these components are not available, a `ValueError` is raised to indicate that the WebSocket connection is not properly set up.
