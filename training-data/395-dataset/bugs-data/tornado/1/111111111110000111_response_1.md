The error occurs in the `set_nodelay` function of the `WebSocketHandler` class in the `tornado/websocket.py` file. The assertion failure occurs at `assert self.stream is not None`, indicating that the `stream` attribute is expected to be not None, but it is found to be None during the assertion.

The `stream` attribute is likely not being properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function. This could be due to a missing initialization of the `stream` attribute within the `WebSocketHandler` class.

To fix the bug, the `stream` attribute needs to be properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` function. This can be done by either setting the attribute during the initialization of the `WebSocketHandler` class or by ensuring that the attribute is set before calling the `set_nodelay` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is None:
        raise ValueError("Stream is not initialized")
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `stream` attribute is None, and if so, we raise a ValueError indicating that the stream is not properly initialized. Otherwise, we proceed to call the `set_nodelay` function on the `stream` attribute.
