The error message indicates that the `res` variable is `None` instead of the expected value "hello". Looking at the provided code, the `test_nodelay` function opens a websocket connection and waits to read a message. The error must lie in the implementation of the `set_nodelay` function in the `WebSocketHandler` class.

The potential error location within the `set_nodelay` function is the line:
```
assert self.stream is not None
```
This line is likely causing the function to fail and return `None` instead of "hello". If `self.stream` is `None`, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `self.stream` attribute is not being properly initialized or set before calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.stream` is properly initialized before calling `set_nodelay(value)`. This can be done during the initialization of the WebSocketHandler or in a separate method that initializes the stream.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
    def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
        """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
        the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.

        See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.
