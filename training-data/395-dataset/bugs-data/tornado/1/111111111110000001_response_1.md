The potential error location within the problematic function is the `set_nodelay` method. The error message from the test case suggests that the `read_message` method is returning None instead of the expected value "hello", indicating that the `set_nodelay` method is not functioning as intended.

The bug occurs because the `set_nodelay` method is not properly setting the no-delay flag for the stream, resulting in delays in sending messages over the websocket connection.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `set_nodelay` method correctly sets the no-delay flag for the stream.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """
    Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent. This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs. To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call `self.set_nodelay(True)` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert self.stream is not None, "Stream is not initialized"
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

By ensuring that the `set_nodelay` method correctly sets the no-delay flag for the stream, the delays in sending websocket messages should be reduced, and the test case should pass without returning None.
