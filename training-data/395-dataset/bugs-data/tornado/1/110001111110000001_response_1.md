The error message indicates that the value of `res` is `None`, whereas it should be `"hello"`. This suggests that the `read_message` method of the `WebSocket` object is not working as expected, which is likely related to the `set_nodelay` method that is being called before establishing the websocket connection.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)` line. It seems that the problem is related to the `self.stream` object not being initialized properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.stream` object is not being properly initialized, which leads to the `set_nodelay` method not functioning correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.stream` object is initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` method. This may involve checking if `self.stream` is `None` and initializing it if necessary.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is None:
        # initialize self.stream if it's not already initialized
        self.stream = initialize_stream()  # replace initialize_stream() with the actual method for initializing the stream
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
``` 

In the corrected code, we first check if `self.stream` is `None`. If it is `None`, then we initialize it. After ensuring that `self.stream` is properly initialized, we then call the `set_nodelay` method on `self.stream` with the provided `value`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `set_nodelay` method works correctly.
