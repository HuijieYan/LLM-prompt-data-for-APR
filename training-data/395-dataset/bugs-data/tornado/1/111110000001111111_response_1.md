The error occurs in the `set_nodelay` method of the `WebSocketHandler` class. The assertion `assert self.stream is not None` fails, which means that `self.stream` is None when it's not supposed to be. This is likely due to the fact that the `self.stream` attribute is not initialized properly, leading to the assertion failure.

To fix this bug, the `self.stream` attribute needs to be properly initialized before calling the `set_nodelay` method. This can be done in the `open` method of the `WebSocketHandler` class, where the WebSocket connection is established.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` method:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream is None:
        # Handle the case where self.stream is not initialized
        raise ValueError("WebSocket stream is not initialized")
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `self.stream` is not None before calling the `set_nodelay` method on it. This will prevent the assertion failure and provide a more appropriate error handling mechanism in case `self.stream` is unexpectedly None.
