The error occurs in the test function `test_nodelay` from the file `websocket_test.py`. The test is expecting the `read_message()` method to return "hello", but it is returning `None`, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error in the `set_nodelay` function is that it is not actually setting the nodelay flag for the WebSocket stream.

The reason for the bug is that the `set_nodelay` function is defined twice in the `WebSocketHandler` class, and the second definition is not actually setting the nodelay flag for the WebSocket stream.

To fix the bug, the second definition of the `set_nodelay` function in the `WebSocketHandler` class needs to be removed, and its functionality should be incorporated into the first definition.

Here's the corrected `set_nodelay` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WebSocketHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
        """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.
    
        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
        the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.
    
        See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.
    
        .. versionadded:: 3.1
        """
        assert self.stream is not None
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

The second definition of the `set_nodelay` function should be removed from the code. Once this is done, the functionality in the second definition will be incorporated into the first definition, and the bug should be fixed.
