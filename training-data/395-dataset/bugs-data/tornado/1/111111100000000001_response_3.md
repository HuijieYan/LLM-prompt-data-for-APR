The code provided is attempting to define a method `set_nodelay` within the `WebSocketHandler` class. The problem is that the method is defined twice within the class, with the second definition being the problematic one. 

The potential error location is the second definition of the `set_nodelay` method.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that Python does not allow redefining a method within a class. Therefore, the second definition is overriding the first one, which is likely causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the second definition of the `set_nodelay` method should be removed, and any necessary modifications should be made within the original definition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
        """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

        By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
        the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
        due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
        ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
        bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
        connection is established.

        See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

        .. versionadded:: 3.1
        """
        assert self.stream is not None
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
