The error occurs because the `set_nodelay` function is not implemented correctly. The function checks if `self.stream is not None` and then calls `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`. However, in the given test case, `self.stream` is None, which leads to the assertion failure.

To fix this issue, the `set_nodelay` function should handle the case where `self.stream` is None, and also handle any potential errors that may arise when calling `self.stream.set_nodelay(value)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    if self.stream is not None:
        try:
            self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle any potential errors when setting nodelay
            print("Error setting nodelay: {}".format(e))
    else:
        # Handle the case where self.stream is None
        print("Cannot set nodelay: stream is not available")
