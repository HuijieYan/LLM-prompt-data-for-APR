The error is occurring in the `set_nodelay` function of the `WebSocketHandler` class. The assertion `assert self.stream is not None` is failing, which means that `self.stream` is `None` when the `set_nodelay` function is being called.

The reason for this bug is that the `set_nodelay` function is being defined twice in the `WebSocketHandler` class. This means that the second definition is overriding the first one, which could be causing the issue.

To fix this bug, the second definition of the `set_nodelay` function should be removed, and the implementation of the `set_nodelay` function should be included in the first definition.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_nodelay` function:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """
    Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    if self.stream:
        self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

By removing the second definition of the `set_nodelay` function and implementing the logic inside the first definition, we ensure that the `self.stream` attribute is checked for existence before calling the `set_nodelay` method on it, thus preventing the assertion failure.
