The potential error in the provided function is that it does not have access to the `set_nodelay` method of the WebSocketProtocol13 object. This is likely due to the incorrect assignment of the `self.stream` object, which is expected to have the `set_nodelay` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `self.stream` object is correctly assigned as the WebSocketProtocol13 object so that it can access the `set_nodelay` method.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.

    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.

    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert isinstance(self.stream, WebSocketProtocol13)
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```

In the corrected code, we added an assertion to ensure that `self.stream` is indeed an instance of `WebSocketProtocol13` before calling its `set_nodelay` method. This will prevent any potential runtime errors related to incorrect object assignment.
