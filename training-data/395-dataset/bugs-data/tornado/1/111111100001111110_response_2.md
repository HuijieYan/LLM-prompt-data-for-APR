# Corrected function

```python
def set_nodelay(self, value: bool) -> None:
    """Set the no-delay flag for this stream.

    By default, small messages may be delayed and/or combined to minimize
    the number of packets sent.  This can sometimes cause 200-500ms delays
    due to the interaction between Nagle's algorithm and TCP delayed
    ACKs.  To reduce this delay (at the expense of possibly increasing
    bandwidth usage), call ``self.stream.set_nodelay(True)`` once the websocket
    connection is established.
    
    See `.BaseIOStream.set_nodelay` for additional details.
    
    .. versionadded:: 3.1
    """
    assert isinstance(self.stream, tornado.iostream.IOStream)
    self.stream.set_nodelay(value)
```
In the corrected function, the assert statement has been modified to check if `self.stream` is an instance of `tornado.iostream.IOStream` using `isinstance` method. This change ensures that the assertion failure is avoided.
