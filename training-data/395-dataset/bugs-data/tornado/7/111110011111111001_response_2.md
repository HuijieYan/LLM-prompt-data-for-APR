The error occurs when the function `async_wrapper` awaits the result of `IOLoop.current().run_in_executor`, passing the `sync_func` and the events `event1` and `event2` as arguments. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "object Future can't be used in 'await' expression".

The issue appears to be with the implementation of the `run_in_executor` method within the `IOLoop` class. Based on the error and the provided inputs, it seems that the `run_in_executor` method is not returning the expected `Future` object, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to await its result.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `run_in_executor` method to return a `Future` object that can be properly awaited. Additionally, we can also ensure that the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is instantiated and assigned to `self._executor` as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, Future

    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = Future()
    executor.submit(lambda: future.set_result(func(*args)))
    return future
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is imported and then used to submit the `func(*args)` to the executor. The result of the `func` call is then set as the result of the `Future` object, which is returned by the `run_in_executor` method. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and allow the awaited result to be properly handled.
