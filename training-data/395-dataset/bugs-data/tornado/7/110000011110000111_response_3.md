The error message indicates a TypeError stating that the object Future can't be used in an 'await' expression. This error occurs when trying to use an object of type Future directly in an 'await' expression, which is not allowed.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `run_in_executor` method. The issue seems to be with how the `executor.submit` method returns a Future object, which is then being used in an 'await' expression.

To fix the issue, the `run_in_executor` method should return a `Future` object using the `executor`'s `submit` method, and the caller of this method should handle the obtained `Future` appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

The correction in the function is regarding how the `executor.submit` method is being used. The function should be left as it is, and the caller of this method should handle the obtained `Future` appropriately without using 'await' directly on it.
