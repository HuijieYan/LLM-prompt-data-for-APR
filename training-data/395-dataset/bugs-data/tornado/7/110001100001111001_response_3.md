Error analysis:
The problem with the buggy function is that it checks for the existence of ThreadPoolExecutor using `ThreadPoolExecutor is None`, which will always be false. It should be checking if `executor` is None instead.

Suggested fix:
Change the condition from `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` to `if executor is None:`.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_7/tornado/ioloop.py

# Corrected function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
