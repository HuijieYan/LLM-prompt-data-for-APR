The error message `TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression` in the test function indicates that the `run_in_executor` function is not returning the expected result, which leads to the inability to use the future with the `await` keyword.

The potential error location within the `run_in_executor` function is in the line `return executor.submit(func, *args)`. This line is not returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` as expected, but rather a `concurrent.futures._base.Future`, which causes the error when using `await` with it.

The bug occurs because the `executor.submit` function is not returning the appropriate type of future that can be awaited. Instead, it is returning the base class future, which does not support the `await` keyword.

To fix this bug, the `submit` function of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class should be replaced with the `Tornado` framework's `IOLoop.run_in_executor` method, which wraps the submitted function in a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object to properly support awaiting the result.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    return IOLoop.current().run_in_executor(executor, func, *args)
```
