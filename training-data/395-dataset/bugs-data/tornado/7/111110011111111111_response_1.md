The error message indicates a TypeError involving the use of a Future object in an 'await' expression. This suggests that the issue may be related to how the future object is being handled in the run_in_executor function.

Upon inspecting the buggy function, it appears that the run_in_executor function is not handling the executor parameter properly. It checks for the availability of ThreadPoolExecutor, but it does not utilize the executor that is passed as a parameter to the function. Instead, it always defaults to using self._executor.

The bug occurs because the executor parameter is not being used to run the provided function in a concurrent.futures.Executor. This leads to the incorrect handling of the future object, resulting in the TypeError when it is used in the 'await' expression.

To address the issue, the run_in_executor function needs to be modified to utilize the executor parameter that is passed. It should use the provided executor to submit the function and its arguments for execution in a concurrent.futures.Executor.

Here's the corrected code for the run_in_executor function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

By using the provided executor to submit the function and its arguments, the run_in_executor function can now correctly handle the future object, resolving the TypeError issue encountered in the test case.

This correction ensures that the run_in_executor function properly utilizes the executor parameter for running functions in a concurrent.futures.Executor.
