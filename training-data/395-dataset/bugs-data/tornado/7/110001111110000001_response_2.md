The error message indicates that a `Future` object is being used in an `await` expression, causing a `TypeError`. This means that the `run_in_executor` function is not returning a proper awaitable object.

The potential error location within the `run_in_executor` function is the line:

```python
return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

The `submit` method of the `executor` is returning a `Future` object, which cannot be awaited directly.

The bug occurs because the `run_in_executor` function is not returning an awaitable that can be used with `await`. To fix this, the function should return a `Future` object that is compatible with `await` expressions.

One approach to fixing this bug is to use the `tornado.concurrent.Future` class to create a new future, set the result of the `func` call as the result of the future, and then return the future. This would allow the `run_in_executor` function to return an awaitable object.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
from tornado.concurrent import Future

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = Future()
    executor.submit(lambda: future.set_result(func(*args)))
    return future
```
