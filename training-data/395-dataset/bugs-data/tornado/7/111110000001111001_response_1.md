The bug in the `run_in_executor` method arises from the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`. The intent of this condition is to check if the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class is available, but it incorrectly checks if the class itself is None.

To fix this bug, the condition should be modified to `if executor is None` to check if the provided executor is None.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """
    Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
