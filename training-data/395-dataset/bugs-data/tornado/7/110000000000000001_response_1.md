Potential error location: The conditional statement `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` is incorrect because it checks if the class `ThreadPoolExecutor` itself is None, which will always evaluate to False. The intended check should be for the `executor` parameter to see if it is None.

Reason for the bug: The conditional check is not correctly checking for the presence of the executor, leading to the incorrect usage of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class.

Approach for fixing the bug: Modify the conditional statement to check if the `executor` parameter is None instead of checking `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
