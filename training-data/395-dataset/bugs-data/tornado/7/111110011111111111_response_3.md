The error message "TypeError: object `Future` can't be used in 'await' expression" suggests that the `run_in_executor` method is returning a `Future` object instead of the expected result. This indicates that the `run_in_executor` method is not functioning correctly.

The potential error location is within the `run_in_executor` method, specifically the line `return executor.submit(func, *args)`. The `submit` method of the executor should return a concurrent future, but it seems to be returning a different type of future.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `submit` method is not returning the expected concurrent future object, causing the `run_in_executor` method to return the wrong type of future.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the `submit` method of the executor returns the correct type of concurrent future. This may involve checking the documentation or source code of the executor to understand the expected behavior of the `submit` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return concurrent.futures.Future(executor, func, *args)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `run_in_executor` method returns the correct type of concurrent future. After implementing this fix, the test functions should be re-run to verify that the issue has been resolved.
