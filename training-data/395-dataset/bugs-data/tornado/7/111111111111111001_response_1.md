The error message "TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression" suggests that there is an issue with the `run_in_executor` method of the `IOLoop` class. The test case is trying to await the result of `run_in_executor`, which seems to be causing the error.

The potential error location within the `run_in_executor` method is the return statement `return executor.submit(func, *args)`. This returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, but the test case expects it to return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run_in_executor` method should return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object to be compatible with the `await` expression in the test case. However, it is currently returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use `tornado.concurrent.Futures` instead of `concurrent.futures.Future` in the `run_in_executor` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """
    Runs a function in a `concurrent.futures.Executor`. If `executor` is `None`, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    """

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    from tornado.concurrent import Future
    future = Future()

    def callback(f):
        future.set_result(f.result())

    executor.submit(func, *args).add_done_callback(callback)

    return future
```

This corrected code returns a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object, which should resolve the TypeError that was occurring in the test case.
