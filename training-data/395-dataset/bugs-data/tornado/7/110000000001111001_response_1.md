The potential error is located in the following section of the code:

```python
if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
    raise RuntimeError(
        "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")
```

The issue with the provided code is that it checks for the existence of ThreadPoolExecutor using 'ThreadPoolExecutor is None', which will always return False as 'ThreadPoolExecutor' is not defined in the function scope or imported anywhere within the code.

To fix this bug, we can import 'ThreadPoolExecutor' from 'concurrent.futures' and use it to check for its existence. Additionally, there are no error checks for incorrect inputs, so we can add checks to ensure valid inputs are provided.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
    """

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
