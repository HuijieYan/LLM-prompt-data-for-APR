Potential error location: The if statement `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` is incorrect. It should be checking if `executor` is None instead.

Reason for the bug: The function is incorrectly checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None instead of checking if `executor` is None. This will cause the function to always raise a `RuntimeError` even if `executor` is not None.

Approach for fixing the bug: Change the if statement to check if `executor` is None and remove the unnecessary condition that checks if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None.

Corrected code:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
