Error:
The function checks if ThreadPoolExecutor is not None before using it, but it should be checking if executor is not None.

Additionally, it appears that the error message doesn't match the actual error. The error message suggests that concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor, but the problem is with the conditional statement checking ThreadPoolExecutor instead of executor.

Correction:
Change the conditional statement to check if executor is None before assigning the default executor.

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
