Potential error location: The `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` condition is checking for the existence of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class itself rather than the `executor` instance.

Reason for the bug: The condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` is incorrect as it checks the class type itself rather than the instance of the `executor`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use `executor is None` instead of `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` to check if the `executor` instance is None.
2. Update the conditional checks to use the correct approach for checking the existence of the `executor`.

Corrected code:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
