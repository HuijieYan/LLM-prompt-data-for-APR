The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `executor.submit` method, which returns a Future object. This Future object is causing a TypeError when used in the async/await expression in the test function. This suggests that the `run_in_executor` function does not return a compatible object for use with async/await.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run_in_executor` function is not returning the correct type of object to be used with async/await. Instead of directly returning the result of `executor.submit`, it should return a Future object directly.

To fix this bug, the `run_in_executor` function should return a Future object using the `as_completed` method of the executor. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
  ```
