The error occurs in the `run_in_executor` function of the `IOLoop` class. The function is trying to use an `executor` as a future in an await expression, which is causing a TypeError.

The `run_in_executor` function is returning the result of `executor.submit(func, *args)`, which is a concurrent future. The test case is trying to use this future in an await expression, but it should be retrieving the result from the future instead.

To fix this bug, the `run_in_executor` function should await the result of the `executor.submit(func, *args)` call and return the result. This will ensure that the future is properly awaited and its result is used.

Here's the corrected `run_in_executor` function:

```python
async def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return await executor.submit(func, *args)
```
