The problematic function is `run_in_executor` in the class `IOLoop`. The bug is that it is trying to check if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None instead of checking if `executor` is None. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the if statement from `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:` to `if executor is None:`. This will correctly check if the executor is None and create the default executor if needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
