The error occurs because the `run_in_executor` method is supposed to run a function in a `concurrent.futures.Executor`, but the implementation does not handle the case when the executor is None.

The potential error location is the following section of the code:

```python
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor
```

The bug occurs because the function does not check if the executor is None before trying to access `self._executor`.

To fix this bug, the function `run_in_executor` needs to check if the executor is None before trying to access `self._executor`. If the executor is None, a new `ThreadPoolExecutor` instance should be created and assigned to `self._executor`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor') or self._executor is None:
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
