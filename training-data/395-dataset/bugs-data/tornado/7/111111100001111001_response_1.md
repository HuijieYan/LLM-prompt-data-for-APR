The potential error in the code is in the `run_in_executor` method of the `IOLoop` class. The reason for the bug is that the code is checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is `None`, which is incorrect. The code should check if `executor` is `None` instead.

To fix the bug, we need to change the check from `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` to `if executor is None`.

Here is the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
