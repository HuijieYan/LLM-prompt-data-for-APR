Potential Error:
- The function is trying to check if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is `None`, which is not the correct way to check it.

Reason for the Error:
- The code is using an incorrect check for the availability of `ThreadPoolExecutor`. 

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
- Use a try-except block to catch the `ImportError` that could occur if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is not available. 

Corrected Code:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import functools

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
