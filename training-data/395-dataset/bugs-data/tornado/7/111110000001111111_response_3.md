The error in the provided `run_in_executor` method is that it is checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is `None`, but it should be checking if `executor` is `None`. It also does not import `ThreadPoolExecutor`, which should be imported. Additionally, it doesn't handle the case if `concurrent.futures` module is not available, so that should also be handled.

We can fix the function by implementing the necessary changes as mentioned above.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import concurrent.futures

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
        """
        Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
        ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

        Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.
        """

        from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  # import to check for ThreadPoolExecutor

        if not concurrent.futures:
            raise RuntimeError(
                "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

        if executor is None:
            if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
                from tornado.process import cpu_count
                self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = self._executor

        return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

In the corrected code, the `concurrent.futures` module is imported at the beginning. The conditional check for the availability of `ThreadPoolExecutor` is also updated, and the null check now correctly checks if `executor` is `None`, as intended. Now, the `run_in_executor` should work as expected without any errors.
