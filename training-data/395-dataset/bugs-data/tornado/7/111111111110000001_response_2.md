The error is a `TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression`, which suggests that the Future object being returned from `run_in_executor` cannot be used with the `await` keyword in the test function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement within the `run_in_executor` function. It should be returning the Future object from the `executor.submit` call, which can be used with the `await` keyword.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the buggy function returns the result of the `executor.submit` call instead of the Future object itself.

To fix this bug, the `return executor.submit(func, *args)` statement should be changed to `return executor.submit(func, *args)`, so that the test function can await the Future object.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
