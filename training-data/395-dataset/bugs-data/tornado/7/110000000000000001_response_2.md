The potential error in the code is the if statement `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`, which is checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is None instead of if executor is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is incorrectly checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is None instead of checking if the provided executor is None.

To fix the bug, we should change the if statement to check if executor is None instead of checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is None.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
