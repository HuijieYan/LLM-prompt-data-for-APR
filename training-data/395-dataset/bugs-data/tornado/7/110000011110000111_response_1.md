Potential error location: The `run_in_executor` method is not handling the case where the `executor` is `None` correctly, which causes the error when trying to use `await` with it.

Reason behind the bug: The function is not checking whether the `executor` is `None` before trying to use it. It assumes that the IO loop's default executor will always exist, which may not be the case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `executor` is `None` and if it is, use the IO loop's default executor.
2. If the default executor does not exist, create a new one with an appropriate number of max workers.

Corrected code:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    from tornado.process import cpu_count
    from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            if not hasattr(IOLoop.current(), '_executor'):
                IOLoop.current()._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
            executor = IOLoop.current()._executor
        else:
            executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
