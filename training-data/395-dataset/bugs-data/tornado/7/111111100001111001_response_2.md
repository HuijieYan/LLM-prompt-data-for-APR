The problematic function is `run_in_executor` inside the `IOLoop` class. The function uses ThreadPoolExecutor, but the code does not properly handle cases where ThreadPoolExecutor is not available. The `if` statement is incorrectly checking whether ThreadPoolExecutor is None, which is not the correct way to verify its availability.

It's recommended to use a try-except block to import ThreadPoolExecutor and catch the ImportError if it is not available. Then, handle this error and raise an appropriate exception message to inform the user about the unavailability of ThreadPoolExecutor.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures.thread import ThreadPoolExecutor

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    try:
        return executor.submit(func, *args)
    except ImportError:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")
```

This code addresses the issue by importing ThreadPoolExecutor inside the function. If ThreadPoolExecutor is not available, it will raise an ImportError, which is caught and handled by raising a RuntimeError with the appropriate message.
