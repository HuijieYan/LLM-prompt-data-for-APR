The issue with the provided function `run_in_executor` is that it checks if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None, which will always evaluate to False since `ThreadPoolExecutor` is not None. As a result, the condition to check if `executor` is None will never be True, and the default executor will not be set correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to check the type of `executor` instead of if it's None.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None or not isinstance(executor, ThreadPoolExecutor):
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

In the corrected code, we are checking if `executor` is None or if it's not an instance of `ThreadPoolExecutor`. If any of these conditions are True, we set the default executor.

This will fix the issue of the default executor not being set correctly and ensure that the function runs as expected.
