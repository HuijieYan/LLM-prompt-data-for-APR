The error message indicates that the `Future` object returned by the `run_in_executor` function cannot be used in an 'await' expression. This implies that there is an issue with the `run_in_executor` method's implementation.

The potential error location within the `run_in_executor` method is the `return executor.submit(func, *args)` statement. This is because the `submit` method of the `executor` returns a `Future` object, which cannot be directly used in an 'await' expression.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `run_in_executor` method is not returning a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object that can be awaited in an async function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `run_in_executor` returns a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object instead of the `Future` object returned by the `submit` method of the `executor`.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return self.add_future(executor.submit(func, *args))
```

By using `self.add_future` instead of directly returning the result of `executor.submit`, it ensures that the correct type of `tornado.concurrent.Future` is returned, which can be awaited in an async function.
