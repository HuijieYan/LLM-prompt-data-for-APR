The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`. This condition is checking whether `ThreadPoolExecutor` is not None, however, it should be checking whether `executor` is not None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is checking the wrong variable for None. It is also missing the import statement for `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

To fix the bug, we should import the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class from `concurrent.futures` and then check if the `executor` is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# ... omitted code ...

# this is the corrected function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
