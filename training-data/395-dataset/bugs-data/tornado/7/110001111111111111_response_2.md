The error message "TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression" suggests there is an issue with how the concurrent future object is being used within the `run_in_executor` method.

Upon reviewing the provided function, it appears that the `run_in_executor` method returns a concurrent future object, not a tornado concurrent future object. This can cause issues when trying to use `await` on the result, as the provided error message indicates.

To fix this issue, the `run_in_executor` method should return a tornado concurrent future object instead of a concurrent future object. This can be achieved by using the `tornado.concurrent.Future` class to create the future object and then wrapping the result of the concurrent future with `tornado.concurrent.future_set_result` to set the result of the tornado concurrent future.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from tornado.concurrent import Future, future_set_result
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError("concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    c_future = executor.submit(func, *args)
    t_future = Future()

    def on_complete(f):
        future_set_result(t_future, f.result())

    c_future.add_done_callback(on_complete)

    return t_future
```
