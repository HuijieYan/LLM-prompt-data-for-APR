The issue is that the function does not correctly handle the case when `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None. It then attempts to use it as if it is not None, which results in an AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the `if` condition should be modified to check if `executor` is None rather than checking if `ThreadPoolExecutor` is None.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor
    
    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
