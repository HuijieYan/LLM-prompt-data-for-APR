The error message indicates a TypeError, specifically stating that the object Future can't be used in an 'await' expression.

The potential error location is likely in the implementation of the `run_in_executor` function in the `IOLoop` class. The function uses the `concurrent.futures.thread.ThreadPoolExecutor` to execute the provided `func` and `args` in a separate thread. However, it returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, which cannot be awaited directly in an async function.

To fix this bug, the `run_in_executor` function needs to be modified to return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` instead of a `concurrent.futures.Future` object. 

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError("concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    c_future = executor.submit(func, *args)
    t_future = tornado.concurrent.Future()
    t_future.set_result(c_future.result())

    return t_future
```

By returning a `tornado.concurrent.Future` with the result of the `concurrent.futures.Future`, the function can now be used with an async/await syntax as expected in the test case.
