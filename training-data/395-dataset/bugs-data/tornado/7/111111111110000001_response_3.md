The error occurs during the execution of the test function `test_run_in_executor_native`. It seems that the use of `await` is causing problems with the `run_in_executor` method. This suggests that the `run_in_executor` method is not returning a compatible result for `await`.

The potential error lies in the `run_in_executor` method in the IOLoop class. It is returning a concurrent.futures.Future object, which is not directly awaitable.

The reason behind the bug is that the `run_in_executor` method is not returning a compatible awaitable object, which is necessary when using `await`.

To fix the bug, the `concurrent.futures.Future` object returned by `executor.submit` needs to be wrapped in a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object, which is an awaitable object compatible with the Tornado framework.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from tornado.concurrent import Future

# ...

# this is the fixed function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = executor.submit(func, *args)
    return Future().set_result(future.result())
```

By wrapping the `futures.Result` object in a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object and setting the result of the `futures.Result` as the result of the `tornado.concurrent.Future`, we ensure that the `run_in_executor` method returns an awaitable object compatible with Tornado.
