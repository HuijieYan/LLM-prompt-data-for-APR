The error message indicates that the `Future` object returned by the `executor.submit` call inside the `run_in_executor` function cannot be used in an 'await' expression. This is because the function is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object instead of a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object, which is compatible with the 'await' expression.

To fix this issue, the `run_in_executor` function should return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object instead of a `concurrent.futures.Future` object.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return self.run_in_executor_thread(executor, func, *args)
```

In this corrected implementation, we use `self.run_in_executor_thread` to ensure that a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object is returned, which is compatible with the 'await' expression.

I've also assumed the existence of a method `run_in_executor_thread` that returns a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object. This method should handle the actual execution of the function in the executor and return the appropriate type of future.
