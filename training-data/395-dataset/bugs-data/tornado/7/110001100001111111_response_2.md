Potential error location: The bug may be caused by the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None`, which seems to be checking if the ThreadPoolExecutor class exists, rather than if it is None.

Reason for the bug: The condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` does not check if the executor is None, but rather if the ThreadPoolExecutor class exists in the current scope, resulting in an incorrect check.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Replace the condition `if ThreadPoolExecutor is None` with `if executor is None` to correctly check if the executor is None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
