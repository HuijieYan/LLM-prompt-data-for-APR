The error is occurring because the `run_in_executor` method of the `IOLoop` class is not returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` instance, which is causing the `TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression`. 

Upon analyzing the problematic function, it is clear that the `run_in_executor` method should return a `concurrent.futures.Future` instance, but it is currently returning the result of the `executor.submit` call instead.

To fix the bug, the `run_in_executor` method should be modified to return the result of `executor.submit` call, which will be an instance of `concurrent.futures.Future`.

Here is the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```

With this correction, the `run_in_executor` method now returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` instance, which can be used in the `await` expression as expected.
