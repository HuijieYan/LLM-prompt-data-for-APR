The error message suggests that a TypeError occurred when trying to use a Future object in an 'await' expression. This indicates that the run_in_executor function is not returning a concurrent future as expected, which is causing the test case to fail.

Upon analyzing the function, it becomes apparent that the problem is in the return statement within the run_in_executor function. The current implementation returns an executor.submit() call, which returns a concurrent future. However, the fix should return the result of the executor.submit() call instead, which is the concurrent future that the rest of the code is expecting.

To fix this bug, the run_in_executor function should be updated to return the result of the executor.submit() call.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args).result()  # Return the result of executor.submit() call
```
