The error message suggests that there is a `TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression`. This error implies that the `run_in_executor` method did not return a compatible object for the `await` expression.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement `return executor.submit(func, *args)`. This statement returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, which is not compatible with the `await` expression.

The reason behind this bug is that the `run_in_executor` method is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` when it should return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` to work with `await` expression.

To fix the bug, the `run_in_executor` method should return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object instead of a `concurrent.futures.Future` object. This can be achieved by using the `tornado.concurrent` module to create and return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = concurrent.futures.Future()

    def callback(f):
        if f.exception() is not None:
            future.set_exception(f.exception())
        else:
            future.set_result(f.result())

    executor.submit(func, *args).add_done_callback(callback)

    return future
```
