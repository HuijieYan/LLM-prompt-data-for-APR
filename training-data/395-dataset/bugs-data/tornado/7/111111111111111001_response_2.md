The error "TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression" is likely occurring due to the usage of `concurrent.futures.Future` instead of `tornado.concurrent.Future` in the `run_in_executor` function. This causes the returned future to be of the wrong type, leading to the TypeError when it is used with the 'await' expression.

To fix this bug, the `run_in_executor` function should return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` instead of `concurrent.futures.Future`. This can be achieved by using `tornado.concurrent.Future` instead of `concurrent.futures.Future` in the implementation of the `run_in_executor` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor
    
    future = tornado.concurrent.Future()

    def callback(f):
        if f.exception() is not None:
            future.set_exception(f.exception())
        else:
            future.set_result(f.result())

    executor.submit(func, *args).add_done_callback(callback)

    return future
```

By creating a new `tornado.concurrent.Future` and using it to handle the result of the submitted function, the `run_in_executor` function now returns a `tornado.concurrent.Future` instead of `concurrent.futures.Future`. This should resolve the TypeError issue occurring in the test function.
