The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by an invalid use of the `await` expression with the `Future` object. This suggests that the `run_in_executor` function is returning a `Future` object that is incompatible with the `await` expression.

The potential error location is within the `run_in_executor` function, specifically in the line `return executor.submit(func, *args)`. This is where the `Future` object is being returned.

The bug occurs because the `run_in_executor` function is not returning a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object, which is required for proper async/await behavior in Tornado.

To fix the bug, the `run_in_executor` function needs to be modified to return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object rather than a plain `Future` from the `concurrent.futures` module. This can be achieved by using the `IOLoop`'s `run_in_executor` method, which returns a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object.

The corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return self._run_in_executor(executor, func, *args)
```

In this corrected code, the `run_in_executor` method is using the `_run_in_executor` method from the `IOLoop` class, which returns a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object.
