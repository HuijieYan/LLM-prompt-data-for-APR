The `run_in_executor` function is trying to use the ThreadPoolExecutor without first importing it. Additionally, when `executor` is None, the function should create a new `ThreadPoolExecutor` instead of getting it from `self._executor`. 

The following code provides the corrected `run_in_executor` function: 

```python
# this is the fixed run_in_executor function
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor  # import the ThreadPoolExecutor

    if executor is None:  # if executor is None, create a new ThreadPoolExecutor
        from tornado.process import cpu_count
        executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))

    return executor.submit(func, *args)  # execute the function using submit method of the ThreadPoolExecutor
```
