Potential error location: 
The error seems to be occurring in the `test_run_in_executor_native` test function, particularly in the `async_wrapper` function, which is using `IOLoop.current().run_in_executor` to run the `sync_func` in an executor.

Reason for the bug:
The error message "TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression" suggests that the object returned by `run_in_executor` is not a valid object for the `await` expression. This indicates that the `run_in_executor` function is not returning a valid `Future` object that can be awaited.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `run_in_executor` function returns a valid `Future` object.
2. Verify that the `run_in_executor` function is being called with the correct arguments and that the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is functioning as expected.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args, **kwargs):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args, **kwargs)
```
