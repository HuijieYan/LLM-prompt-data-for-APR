The error message "TypeError: object Future can't be used in 'await' expression" suggests that the issue lies within the `run_in_executor` function. It appears that the code is returning a future object instead of the result of the execution, and the `await` expression is unable to handle it.

The issue occurs because the `run_in_executor` function returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, which cannot be directly awaited in an async function. Instead, the result of the future needs to be awaited.

To fix the bug, the `run_in_executor` function needs to be modified to await the result of the `concurrent.futures.Future` object before returning it.

Here is the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` function:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """
    Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = executor.submit(func, *args)
    
    # Await the result of the future and return it
    return future.result()
```

In this corrected code, the future is obtained using `executor.submit(func, *args)`, and then its result is awaited using `future.result()` before being returned. This way, the result of the execution is obtained and can be properly used in an async function.
