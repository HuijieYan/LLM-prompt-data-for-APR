The potential error in the problematic function is that it is checking if ThreadPoolExecutor is None, which will always return false because ThreadPoolExecutor is a class from the concurrent.futures module. Therefore, the condition will never be executed, and the default executor will not be used.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking whether the executor is None and is not utilizing the default executor from the IO loop.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check if the provided executor is None and then use the default executor from the IO loop if the provided executor is None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    return executor.submit(func, *args)
```
