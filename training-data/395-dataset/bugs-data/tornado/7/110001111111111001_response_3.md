The error message indicates that the `object Future can't be used in 'await' expression`. This means that the `run_in_executor` method is not returning a valid result that can be awaited in the context of the async function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement: `return executor.submit(func, *args)`. This statement is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, which is not compatible with the `await` expression.

The bug occurred because the `run_in_executor` method is returning a `concurrent.futures.Future` object, which is not directly compatible with an `await` expression, causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `run_in_executor` method to return a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object instead of a `concurrent.futures.Future`. The `tornado.concurrent.Future` object is compatible with an `await` expression in the context of the async function.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_in_executor` method:

```python
def run_in_executor(self, executor, func, *args):
    """Runs a function in a ``concurrent.futures.Executor``. If
    ``executor`` is ``None``, the IO loop's default executor will be used.

    Use `functools.partial` to pass keyword arguments to `func`.

    """
    if ThreadPoolExecutor is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "concurrent.futures is required to use IOLoop.run_in_executor")

    if executor is None:
        if not hasattr(self, '_executor'):
            from tornado.process import cpu_count
            self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=(cpu_count() * 5))
        executor = self._executor

    future = executor.submit(func, *args)
    return tornado.concurrent.Future(executor=future)
```

By returning a `tornado.concurrent.Future` object in the `run_in_executor` method, the bug is fixed and the method now correctly handles `await` expressions in the context of async functions.
