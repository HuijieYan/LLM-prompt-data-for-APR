This is... not what I expected black to do :-)

     # Capture each of the exceptions in the MultiError along with each of their causes and contexts
     if isinstance(exc_value, MultiError):
         embedded = []
         for exc in exc_value.exceptions:
             if exc not in _seen:
                 embedded.append(
-                    traceback.TracebackException.from_exception(
-                        exc,
-                        limit=limit,
-                        lookup_lines=lookup_lines,
-                        capture_locals=capture_locals,
-                        # copy the set of _seen exceptions so that duplicates
-                        # shared between sub-exceptions are not omitted
-                        _seen=set(_seen)
-                    )
+                    traceback.TracebackException.from_exception(exc, limit=limit, lookup_lines=lookup_lines, capture_locals=capture_locals, _seen=set(_seen))
+                    # copy the set of _seen exceptions so that duplicates
