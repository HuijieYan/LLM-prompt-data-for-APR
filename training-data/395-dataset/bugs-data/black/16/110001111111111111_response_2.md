The error occurs when the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` attempts to create the variable `normalized_path` by resolving the child's path relative to the root directory. In the test function `test_symlink_out_of_root_directory`, when the resolved path of the symlink's target is clearly outside of the root directory, a `ValueError` is raised.

The bug occurs because the function is unable to handle the case where a file or symlink is outside of the root directory.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case where the resolved path of the file or symlink is outside of the root directory. This can be achieved by adding a `try-except` block to catch the `ValueError` and continue to the next iteration of the loop if the child is a symlink.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Skip if child is a symlink pointing outside the root directory
            else:
                raise  # For other errors, re-raise the exception

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

The `try-except` block ensures that when a `ValueError` is raised because the resolved path of the child is outside of the root directory, the function continues to the next iteration of the loop for symbolic links. For other errors, the original behavior remains unchanged.
