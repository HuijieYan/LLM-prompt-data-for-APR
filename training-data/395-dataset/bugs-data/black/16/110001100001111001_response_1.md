The error here seems to be related to the use of MagicMock objects instead of actual Path objects, leading to issues with attribute access and resolution.

The problem is likely occurring because the `path` and `root` parameters are being mocked using MagicMock objects instead of actual Path objects. As a result, when the code tries to access attributes or methods on these objects, it is encountering errors.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the `path` and `root` parameters are actual Path objects, and not MagicMock objects. Additionally, if there are any other issues identified during testing, those should be fixed as well.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
import re

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        print(message)

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,  # Fix the 'Report' type
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to work properly with actual Path objects and Report instances.
