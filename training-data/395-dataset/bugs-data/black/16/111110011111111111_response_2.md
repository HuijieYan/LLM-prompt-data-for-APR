The error occurs on line 2942, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. This is causing a ValueError when the resolved path of the symbolic link is outside of the root directory and an attempt is made to make it relative to the root directory.

The function `gen_python_files_in_dir` is designed to generate all files under a given `path` that are not excluded by the `exclude` regex but are included by the `include` regex. It traverses through the directory and checks if each file or directory is included or excluded based on the regex patterns.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the resolved path of a file is outside of the root directory. The code should not attempt to make such paths relative to the root directory. Instead, it should skip those paths.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path
import re

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str):
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child

# Test the corrected function
import unittest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

class TestGenPythonFilesInDir(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_gen_python_files_in_dir(self):
        path = Path('/base/repo')  # replace with the actual path
        root = Path('/base/repo')  # replace with the actual root
        include = re.compile(r'\.pyi?$')
        exclude = re.compile(r'/(\.git')
        report = Report()

        # Create mock directories and files
        dir1 = MagicMock(spec=Path)
        dir1.name = 'dir1'
        file1 = MagicMock(spec=Path)
        file1.name = 'file1.py'
        file2 = MagicMock(spec=Path)
        file2.name = 'file2.pyi'

        path.iterdir.return_value = [dir1, file1, file2]

        result = list(gen_python_files_in_dir(path, root, include, exclude, report))
        expected_result = [file1, file2]
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In the corrected function, we remove the call to resolve the child path and make it relative to the root. Instead, we directly use the `relative_to` method. We also added a unit test to verify the correctness of the function. We use Python's built-in `Path` object and MagicMock to simulate the directory structure for testing.
