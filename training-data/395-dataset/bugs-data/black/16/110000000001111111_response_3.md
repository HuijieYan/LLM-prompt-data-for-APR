Based on the provided information, it seems that the error occurs on line 2942, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. This is impossible if the file is outside of the root directory. The error occurs specifically when a symbolic link points to a file or a directory outside of the root directory.

To fix the bug, a possible approach is to handle the case of symlinked resources separately and ignore them when resolving the path relative to the root directory.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path, message):
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_symlink() and not child.resolve().parent.samefile(root):
            continue
        normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_file():
            if not include.match(normalized_path):
                continue
            if exclude.match(normalized_path):
                report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
                continue
            yield child
        elif child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for symlinked resources before resolving the paths relative to the root directory. If the child is a symlink and it points outside of the root directory, we simply continue to the next iteration. This approach ensures that symbolic links pointing to resources outside of the root directory are ignored.
