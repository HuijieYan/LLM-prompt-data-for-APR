The issue seems to be related to the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` crashing when it encounters a symbolic link that points to a file or directory outside of the root directory. The error message indicates that the problem occurs on line 2942, which is when the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory.

The reason behind the bug is that when the function encounters a symlink to a resource outside of the root directory, it tries to resolve the path relative to the root directory. This results in a ValueError when attempting to make the path relative.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the case of symlinked resources by checking if the resolved path can be made relative to the root directory. If it can't, then the function should simply continue to the next iteration without throwing an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, including the handling of symlinked resources:

```python
import os
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def __init__(self, check: bool, quiet: bool, verbose: bool, change_count: int, same_count: int, failure_count: int):
        self.check = check
        self.quiet = quiet
        self.verbose = verbose
        self.change_count = change_count
        self.same_count = same_count
        self.failure_count = failure_count

    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str):
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(path: Path, root: Path, include: Pattern[str], exclude: Pattern[str], report: Report) -> Iterator[Path]:
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + os.path.relpath(child.resolve(), root)
        if os.path.islink(child) and not os.path.exists(child.resolve()):
            continue  # Skip if the symlink points to a non-existing file or directory
        if exclude.search(normalized_path):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            if include.search(normalized_path):
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, we use `os.path.relpath` to get the relative path of the resolved symlink target with respect to the root directory. We also added a check to skip symlinked resources that point to non-existing files or directories.
