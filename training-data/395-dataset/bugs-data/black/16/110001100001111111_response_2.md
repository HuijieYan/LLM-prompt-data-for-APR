The error occurs in the gen_python_files_in_dir() function at line 2942, where it attempts to resolve a file path relative to the root directory.

The error is caused by the presence of symbolic links pointing to files or directories outside of the root directory, which leads to an incorrect path resolution.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle symbolic links properly and skip those that point to resources outside the root directory.

Here's the corrected code for the gen_python_files_in_dir() function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import re
from typing import Iterator, Pattern

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_symlink() and not child.resolve().resolve().relative_to(root):
            continue

        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, "matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
