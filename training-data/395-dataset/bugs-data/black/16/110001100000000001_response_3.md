Potential error location: It seems that the `path_ignored` method is called as `report.path_ignored`, but the original function does not have this method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `path_ignored` method is not defined in the function, but it is being called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Define the `path_ignored` method within the function.
2. Pass an object with the `path_ignored` method as the `report` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        # define path_ignored method
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,  # pass Report object
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")  # call Report's path_ignored method
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
