The error seems to be occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function where there is an error in creating the `normalized_path` using `child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`.

The reason for the error is that the `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` logic expects the `child` path to be located under the `root` path. However, in the test case provided, the `child` path is given as `Path("/a/b/c")` which is not under the `root` path `Path('/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests')`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic for creating the `normalized_path` to only use `child.relative_to(root).as_posix()`. This change will ensure that the normalized path is correctly calculated in relation to the `root` path.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
