The error message indicates that there is a ValueError occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function at line 2942, specifically at the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`.

The reason behind this error is that when a symbolic link is encountered, the resolved path of the file is made relative to the root directory using the `relative_to` method, which raises a ValueError if the file is outside of the root directory.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to handle this case by checking if the child is a symbolic link. If it is a symbolic link, we can skip it and continue to the next iteration. This will prevent the `ValueError` from being raised when a symbolic link is encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path
import re

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, child: Path, message: str):
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path, root: Path, include: Pattern[str], exclude: Pattern[str], report: Report
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_symlink():  # Skip if the child is a symbolic link
            continue
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, before constructing the `normalized_path`, we first check if the `child` is a symbolic link using `child.is_symlink()`. If it is a symbolic link, we skip it and continue to the next iteration. This prevents the `ValueError` from being raised when encountering symbolic links.
