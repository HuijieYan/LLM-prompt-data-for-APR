The error is occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, specifically on the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. The `relative_to` method is attempting to find the relative path of `child` with respect to `root`, but if `child` resolves to a path outside of `root`, it raises a `ValueError`.

The reason for the bug is that when a symbolic link points to a file or directory outside of the root directory, the `relative_to` method cannot find a relative path between the two locations and then raises a `ValueError`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to catch the `ValueError` exception raised by the `relative_to` method and handle it by checking if `child` is a symbolic link. If it is a symbolic link, the function should skip it and continue the loop. Otherwise, it should raise the `ValueError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        print(message)  # Change this to match the actual behavior

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
        path: Path,
        root: Path,
        include: Pattern[str],
        exclude: Pattern[str],
        report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                # Skip the symbolic link and continue to the next iteration
                continue
            else:
                raise  # Re-raise the ValueError
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

This corrected code includes a `try-except` block to catch the `ValueError` raised by the `relative_to` method. If the error is caught and `child` is a symbolic link, it skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, it re-raises the `ValueError` to handle other non-symbolic link cases.
