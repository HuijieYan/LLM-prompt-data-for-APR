Potential error location:
The ValueError is raised at the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()` in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the implementation assumes that all files and directories can be resolved relative to the root directory. However, symbolic links can point to resources outside of the root directory, which causes the `ValueError` when trying to make the path relative to the root directory.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` when trying to make the path relative to the root directory. If the error occurs, it can be assumed that the file or directory is outside of the root directory and should be ignored.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Ignore symlink pointing outside of the root directory
            else:
                raise  # Re-raise other ValueErrors
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
