# Fixed function source code
```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def __init__(self, check, quiet, verbose, change_count, same_count, failure_count):
        self.check = check
        self.quiet = quiet
        self.verbose = verbose
        self.change_count = change_count
        self.same_count = same_count
        self.failure_count = failure_count

    def path_ignored(self, path, message):
        print(f"Ignoring path {path}: {message}")

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    def is_subpath(p1, p2):
        try:
            p1.relative_to(p2)
            return True
        except ValueError:
            return False

    for child in path.iterdir():
        if is_subpath(child, root):
            normalized_path = "/" + child.as_posix()
            exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
            if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                report.path_ignored(child, "matches the --exclude regular expression")
                continue

            if child.is_dir():
                yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

            elif child.is_file():
                include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
                if include_match:
                    yield child
```

The fixed function includes the creation of the `Report` class to handle output about exclusions, and it also adds a `is_subpath` function to check whether a path is a subpath of another. This function is used to handle the case where there is a symlink to a resource outside of the root directory. If the child path is not a subpath of the root, it will be ignored.
