The issue is likely occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, specifically at the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. The error message indicates that the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory, which is impossible if the file is outside of the root directory.

The reason for the bug is that the function attempts to resolve the path of the file relative to the root directory, which causes an error when the file is a symbolic link outside of the root directory.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add a try-except block to handle the case where the resolved path is outside of the root directory. If the resolved path is outside of the root directory and the file is a symbolic link, the function should continue to the next iteration without processing the file. If the error is not related to a symbolic link, it should be raised as usual.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, child, message):
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            else:
                raise
            
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

This revised code includes a try-except block to handle cases where the resolved path is outside of the root directory. If the resolved path is outside of the root directory and the file is a symbolic link, the function continues to the next iteration without processing the file. If the error is not related to a symbolic link, it is raised as usual.
