Potential error location: The variable `exclude` is used as a regex pattern without being explicitly compiled from a string.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `exclude` variable is used as a regex pattern directly without explicitly compiling it first, which can cause unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Compile the `exclude` regex pattern using the `re.compile` function before using it in the function.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator, Union

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path, message):
        print(f"{path}: {message}")


def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Union[Report, None] = None,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            if report is not None:
                report.path_ignored(child, "matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child

# Example usage
root_path = Path("/path/to/root")
include_pattern = re.compile(r"(\.py)$")
exclude_pattern = re.compile(r"(exclude_pattern)")
report = Report()
for file in gen_python_files_in_dir(root_path, root_path, include_pattern, exclude_pattern, report):
