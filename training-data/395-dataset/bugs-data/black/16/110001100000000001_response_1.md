The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect use of the `yield` and `yield from` statements.

The bug occurs because the function is using `yield` and `yield from` within the same function, which is causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the redundant definition of the function and the class `Report`, and updated the signature of the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function to take an instance of the `Report` class instead of a string. Additionally, the `yield from` statement is used to recursively yield files from subdirectories.
