1. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` line in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function. It suggests that the resolved path of the files is being made relative to the root directory, which is causing a ValueError when the file is outside of the root directory.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line:
   `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`

3. The bug occurs because when Black encounters a symbolic link pointing to a file or directory outside of the root directory, it attempts to resolve the child's path relative to the root directory. This causes a ValueError because the resolved path is not within the root directory.

4. The bug can be fixed by adding a try-except block to catch the ValueError when attempting to make the resolved path relative to the root directory. If a ValueError is raised, it means the file is outside of the root directory, so we should skip it when it's a symlink and continue with the iteration of files.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import re
from typing import Iterator, Pattern

# Corrected function
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            # Skip the file if it is outside of the root directory and is a symlink
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            raise
        
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

By adding a try-except block and handling the ValueError, we can skip files that are outside of the root directory when they are symbolic links. This should resolve the issue where Black crashes when encountering symbolic links to resources outside of the root directory.
