The error occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function when trying to resolve the relative path between the child path and the root path. The specific line causing the error is:

```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```

The error message indicates that the `child` path "/a/b/c" does not start with the `root` path '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests'. This is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `relative_to` method.

To fix this issue, the `relative_to` method should be used with the `root` path as the argument to get the relative path of `child` with respect to the `root` path. Additionally, the absolute paths should be converted to relative paths before being concatenated.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In this corrected function, the relative path of the `child` with respect to the `root` is obtained using the `relative_to` method, and then it is converted to a posix path. This should resolve the error encountered in the test case.
