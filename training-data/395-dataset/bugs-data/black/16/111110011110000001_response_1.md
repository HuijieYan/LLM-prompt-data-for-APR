The error seems to be occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, specifically at the line: `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. 

The root cause of the issue is that the `relative_to` method used here expects `root` to be a parent directory of `child`, which is not the case here. As a result, it raises a `ValueError` because it cannot find a relative path between the two.

To fix this issue, we can simply replace the problematic line with `normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()`. This will generate the normalized path based on the relationship between `root` and `child` directly, without the need for resolving and relative determination.

Here's the corrected `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
