The error occurs when the resolved path of a file is made relative to the root directory, and the file is outside of the root directory, it raises a `ValueError`. This happens because the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` doesn't handle the case where the file is outside of the root directory and is a symlink.

To fix the bug, the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` should be modified to handle the case where the file is a symlink and is outside of the root directory by catching the `ValueError` and continuing if the file is a symlink. This will prevent Black from crashing when it encounters a symlink pointing to a resource outside of the root directory.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            else:
                raise

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

By including a `try-except` block to catch the `ValueError` and continue if the file is a symlink, the function will handle the case where the file is outside of the root directory and is a symlink. This will prevent the crash when Black encounters such a situation.
