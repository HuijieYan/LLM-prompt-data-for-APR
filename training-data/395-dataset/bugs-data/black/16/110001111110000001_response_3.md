The error is occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function due to a ValueError being raised by the `relative_to` method of the `Path` class. This error is caused because the `normalized_path` is being computed incorrectly, resulting in a mismatch between the path and the root directory.

The issue arises because the `normalized_path` is being computed as "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix(). However, the `relative_to` method is being used incorrectly. The `relative_to` method is used to find the relative path from one path to another, but in this context, it is being used to construct a normalized path.

To fix this issue, we can remove the usage of the `relative_to` method and simply construct the normalized path by joining the root path and the child path. We can then use this normalized path for further processing.

Here's the corrected `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = root.joinpath(child)
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path /= "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
