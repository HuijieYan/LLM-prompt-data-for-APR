The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line that concatenates the normalized_path with a forward slash when the child is a directory:
```python
normalized_path += "/"
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "normalized_path" may already end with a forward slash if it is a directory path, and concatenating another forward slash may result in an incorrect path format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to check whether the "normalized_path" is a directory path before concatenating a forward slash.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/" if not normalized_path.endswith("/") else ""
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
