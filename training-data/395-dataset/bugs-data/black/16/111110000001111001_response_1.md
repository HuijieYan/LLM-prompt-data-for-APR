Potential error location:
The potential error location could be in the way the path is being normalized and checked against the include and exclude patterns.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the path normalization and comparison with the include and exclude regex patterns. The use of MagicMock objects instead of actual file system paths could also be a potential reason for the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the actual runtime values of the path and child objects to ensure they are valid file system paths.
2. Use the correct methods to check if a path is a directory or a file, and handle symbolic links appropriately.
3. Improve the normalization process to ensure that the paths are correctly formatted for comparison with the regex patterns.

Corrected code:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator


def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    if not root.is_absolute():
        raise ValueError(f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}")

    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the assert statement and replaced it with a ValueError exception if the root path is not absolute. We have also removed the unnecessary "/" prefix in the normalized_path and modified the normalization process to correctly handle directories. Finally, we have removed the MagicMock objects and assume that actual file system paths are provided as input to the function.
