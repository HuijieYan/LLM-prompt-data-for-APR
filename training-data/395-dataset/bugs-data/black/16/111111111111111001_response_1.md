The test case `test_symlink_out_of_root_directory` prepares the required arguments and calls the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function. It sets the mock behavior for the `path.iterdir` and `child.resolve` to mimic a symlink behavior and a file behavior respectively. The test expects that the call to `gen_python_files_in_dir` should not raise any error in the first case and should raise a `ValueError` in the second case.

The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` in the `relative_to` method of the `Path` class, specifically that the path `/a/b/c` does not start with the expected root path.

The potential error location within the problematic function is where the `normalized_path` is being calculated:
```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```

The reason behind this error is that when the `child` variable is resolved and the `relative_to` method is called, it expects `root` to be the parent of the resolved path, which is not the case in the test scenario. This leads to the `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, the resolved path should be directly compared with the `root` path instead of calculating the relative path.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, the `normalized_path` is calculated directly using `as_posix()`, without using `relative_to(root)`, to avoid the `ValueError`.
