The error occurs on line 2948 of the `black.py` file, specifically in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, at the point `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. The error `ValueError: '/a/b/c' does not start with '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests'` indicates that the `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` operation is not working as expected.

The reason behind the bug is that the `child.resolve()` method does not provide the expected absolute path that `relative_to` expects. This might be due to an issue in resolving the `child` variable to an absolute path.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `child` variable is resolved to an absolute path before using it in the `relative_to` method. This can be done by replacing `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` with `root.relative_to(child.resolve())`.

Below is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + root.relative_to(child.resolve()).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
