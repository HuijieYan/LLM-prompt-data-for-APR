# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Crash if there is a symlink to a resource outside of the root directory
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Hello there, thank you for this great tool!

Black crashes when it finds a symbolic link pointing to a file or a directory outside of the root directory.

Steps to reproduce

Create the following structure:
base
  |-- repo
  |     |-- dummy.py
  |     `-- resource -> ../resource
  `-- resource
Initiate base/repo as a Git repository (so as to set the root directory);
Call black . within base/repo;
Expected behavior: Black ends as expected;
Current behavior: throws an exception:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
  File "/usr/lib64/python3.6/pathlib.py", line 872, in relative_to
    .format(str(self), str(formatted)))
ValueError: '/data/test_black/base/resource' does not start with '/data/test_black/base/repo'
As pointed out in the backtrace, this is due to the line 2942, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. This is indeed impossible if the file is outside of the root directory. One can wonder if it makes sense to have an external link within a repository, but, well I am in this case.

Adding the conflicting file/folder to the exclude list does not work.

Possible workaround

A possible workaround could be to simply ignore this case and do not handle this simlinked resource:

        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()

        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue                                                        

            raise
