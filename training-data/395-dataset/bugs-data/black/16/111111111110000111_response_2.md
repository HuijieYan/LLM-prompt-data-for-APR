This bug is related to the handling of symlinked files that are outside of the root directory. The error message indicates that the issue occurs at line 2942, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory.

The bug occurs because when resolving the path of a symlinked file, it references a location outside of the root directory. This causes a ValueError when trying to make the resolved path relative to the root directory.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to catch the ValueError and continue processing if the child is a symlink. If it is not a symlink, then the ValueError should be raised.

Here's the corrected code for the gen_python_files_in_dir function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Ignore symlinked files outside of the root directory
            else:
                raise

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, a try-except block is used to catch the ValueError when resolving the path. If the child is a symlink, the function continues to the next iteration. If the ValueError occurs for a non-symlinked child, it is re-raised.
