The bug occurs in the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()` in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function. This line tries to resolve the path of the file relative to the root directory, which causes an error when the file is outside the root directory, especially when it is a symbolic link.

The error occurs because the function assumes that all files are within the root directory, and it does not handle the case where a file is outside the root directory, such as in the case of a symbolic link.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to add a try-except block around the code that tries to resolve the path relative to the root directory. If a `ValueError` is raised, it means the file is outside the root directory, so the code should skip processing the file.

A corrected version of the function would look like this:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # skip processing the symbolic link
            else:
                raise

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In this corrected version, we added a `try-except` block to handle the case where the file is outside the root directory. If a `ValueError` is raised, we check if the file is a symbolic link, and if so, we skip processing it. Otherwise, we re-raise the exception to handle other cases that may cause a `ValueError`.
