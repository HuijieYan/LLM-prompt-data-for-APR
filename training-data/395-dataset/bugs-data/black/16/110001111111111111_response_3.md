The error is occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, specifically in the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. This line is trying to find the relative path of the `child` with respect to the `root` directory, and it throws a `ValueError` when the resolved path of the files is outside the root directory. The issue is likely due to the presence of symlinks to resources outside the root directory.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function to handle the case where the resolved path is outside the root directory. One possible approach is to catch the `ValueError` and continue the loop if the `child` is a symlink.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Ignore symlinked resources outside the root directory
            else:
                raise  # Raise any other ValueError
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

By using a try-except block to catch the `ValueError`, we can handle the case where the resolved path is outside the root directory and continue the loop for symlinked resources.

This should resolve the issue of crashing when a symlink points to a resource outside of the root directory.
