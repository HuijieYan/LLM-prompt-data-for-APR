The given function is intended to generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex. The function uses a `report` object to log any paths that are ignored due to matching with the exclude regular expression.

The error that occurred is due to the `child` being mocked and not representing a real Path object, resulting in calls to `child.resolve()` to also return mocks instead of actual resolved paths.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `path` and the `child` directories are represented as actual Path objects, allowing the function to accurately determine child paths by resolving them properly.

Below is the corrected function with the fix applied:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
import re
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def __init__(self, check, quiet, verbose, change_count, same_count, failure_count):
        self.check = check
        self.quiet = quiet
        self.verbose = verbose
        self.change_count = change_count
        self.same_count = same_count
        self.failure_count = failure_count
        
    def path_ignored(self, path, message):
        print(f'IGNORED: {path} - Reason: {message}')

def gen_python_files_in_dir(path: Path, root: Path, include: Pattern[str], exclude: Pattern[str], report: Report) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
            else:
                exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
                if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                    report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")


report = Report(check=False, quiet=False, verbose=False, change_count=0, same_count=0, failure_count=0)
root = Path('/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests')
include = re.compile('\\.pyi?$')
exclude = re.compile('/(\\.git')

# Test the function with a sample path
for path in gen_python_files_in_dir(root, root, include, exclude, report):
    print(path)
