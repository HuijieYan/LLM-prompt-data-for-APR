The root cause of the bug is that the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` uses the `Path.resolve()` method on the file paths, which resolves symbolic links. If a symlink points to a file or directory outside of the root directory, this will result in an error when trying to make the path relative to the root.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle symlinks pointing outside the root directory differently. If the child is a symlink and its resolved path does not start with the root directory, we can simply skip it and continue to the next path.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink() and not child.resolve().resolve().as_posix().startswith(root.as_posix()):
                continue  # Skip the symlink pointing outside of the root directory
            else:
                raise
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

This revised code handles the case where `ValueError` is raised, which occurs when the resolved path of the file is not within the root directory. If the child is a symlink and its resolved path is outside the root directory, it will simply continue to the next path without raising an error.
