The error occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function at the line:

```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```

The error is caused when the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. If the file is outside of the root directory or is a symlink, then a `ValueError` is raised because it is impossible to make the file's path relative to the root directory in such cases.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the case of symlinked resources separately and continue without raising an error. We can add a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` and continue processing if a symlink is encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this correction, the function will handle symlinked resources separately and continue without raising a `ValueError` if a symlink is encountered.
