The bug occurs when the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` tries to resolve the paths of files relative to the root directory. If a file is a symbolic link pointing to a resource outside of the root directory, the resolution will fail and result in a ValueError.

To fix this issue, a try-except block can be used to handle the ValueError when attempting to resolve the path of the files. If the path resolution fails due to a symbolic link outside of the root directory, the function should continue to the next iteration.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, child, message):
        print(f"Ignored Child: {child}, Reason: {message}")

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Skip if the file is a symbolic link outside of the root directory
            raise
        
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

This revised code uses a try-except block to handle the ValueError when resolving the path of files relative to the root directory. If the path resolution fails due to a symbolic link outside of the root directory, the function will continue to the next iteration without raising an error.
