The issue occurs when the function tries to make the resolved path of the files relative to the root directory. This causes an error if the file is outside of the root directory, such as in the case of a symbolic link.

To fix the bug, we can add an exception handling block to catch the ValueError and continue to the next iteration if the file is a symbolic link.

Here's the corrected code for the gen_python_files_in_dir function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path, reason):
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Skip symbolic links that are outside of the root directory

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this updated code, the function will handle symbolic links that are outside of the root directory by simply continuing to the next iteration, allowing the function to complete without causing an error in such scenarios.
