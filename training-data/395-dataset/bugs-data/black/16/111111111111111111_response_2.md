The error is occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function due to the handling of symbolic links when generating the relative path to the root directory.

The root cause of the bug is that the code attempts to resolve the path for symbolic links and then make it relative to the root directory, which leads to a `ValueError` when the resolved path is outside of the root directory.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle symbolic links differently. When a symbolic link points to a resource outside of the root directory, it should be ignored and the function should continue processing other files and directories.

Here is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_symlink():
            resolved_path = child.resolve()
            if resolved_path.relative_to(root, follow_symlinks=False).is_absolute():
                # Skip symbolic links that resolve outside of the root directory
                continue

        normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, when a symbolic link is encountered, it first checks if the resolved path is outside of the root directory. If so, it skips the symbolic link and continues with the next file or directory. This prevents the `ValueError` from occurring.

This should resolve the issue related to symlinks pointing to resources outside of the root directory and prevent the crash that was occurring.
