The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line where `normalized_path` is being constructed. 

The bug occurs because of the inconsistency between the usage of "/" and Path.as_posix() in constructing the `normalized_path`. 

To fix the bug, the `normalized_path` should be constructed using `child`'s `resolve()` and then converted to a relative path using the `relative_to(root)` method. We can then use `as_posix()` to convert it to a string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Iterator, Pattern

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
