The error message mentions a `ValueError` raised at the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. This line suggests the error might be due to the resolution of the relative path of `child` with respect to `root`.

The issue appears to be with the calculation of the relative path using the `relative_to` method. The `child.resolve()` returns an absolute path, which is then used to calculate the relative path using the `root`. However, in the test case, the resolved path of `child` is clearly outside of the root directory, leading to the `ValueError`.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to compare the resolved `child` path with the `root` to ensure that it is within the root directory before attempting to calculate the relative path.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
        path: Path,
        root: Path,
        include: Pattern[str],
        exclude: Pattern[str],
        report: "Report",
    ) -> Iterator[Path]:
        """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
        `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.
    
        `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
        """
        assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
        for child in path.iterdir():
            if not child.resolve().relative_to(root).is_absolute():
                normalized_path = child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
                if child.is_dir():
                    normalized_path += "/"
                exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
                if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                    report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
                    continue
    
                if child.is_dir():
                    yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
    
                elif child.is_file():
                    include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
                    if include_match:
                        yield child
