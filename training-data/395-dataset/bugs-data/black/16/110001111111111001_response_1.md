The error occurs during the execution of the gen_python_files_in_dir function, specifically within the line:

```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```

The error message indicates that the path '/a/b/c' does not start with '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests', which is causing the ValueError.

The reason behind this bug is that when creating the normalized_path, it is using the resolved path relative to the root, and this operation is not producing the expected result.

To fix this bug, we need to use the relative_to function of the Path class correctly. Instead of using the resolved path, we should use the original path for the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the gen_python_files_in_dir function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
        path: Path,
        root: Path,
        include: Pattern[str],
        exclude: Pattern[str],
        report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + str(child.relative_to(root))
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, I use the relative_to function with the original path without calling the resolve method. This should fix the bug and produce the expected behavior based on the given test case.
