The error occurs when the `resolve()` method is called on a mocked object. This method is supposed to return the resolved real path of the object, but in the provided test case, it returns a `Path("/a/b/c")` which is clearly outside of the root directory `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests`. This causes the `relative_to()` method to raise a `ValueError` because the paths are not related.

To fix this issue, the `resolve()` method of the `child` object should be mocked to return a path within the root directory, not outside of it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
        path: Path,
        root: Path,
        include: Pattern[str],
        exclude: Pattern[str],
        report: "Report",
    ) -> Iterator[Path]:
        """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
        `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.
    
        `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
        """
        assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
        for child in path.iterdir():
            if not child.is_symlink() and (child.is_dir() or child.is_file()):
                normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
                if child.is_dir():
                    normalized_path += "/"
                exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
                if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                    report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
                    continue
    
                if child.is_dir():
                    yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
    
                elif child.is_file():
                    include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
                    if include_match:
                        yield child
```

With this corrected code, the test case should run without errors.
