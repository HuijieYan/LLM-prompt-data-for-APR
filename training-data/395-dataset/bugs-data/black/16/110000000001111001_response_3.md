The potential error in the provided function is caused by the way the `path` and `child` variables are being handled. The use of MagicMock objects suggests that the function is being tested with mocks instead of real paths, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Replace the MagicMock objects with real Path objects for both `path` and `child`.
2. Ensure that the `root` is an absolute path.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path, message):
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In this corrected version, real Path objects are used for `path` and `child` instead of the MagicMock objects. Additionally, the `root` is asserted to be an absolute path as per the original implementation.
