The bug occurs in the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` on line 2942, where it tries to make the resolved path of the files relative to the root directory. This causes an error if the file is outside of the root directory, as indicated in the provided GitHub issue description.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not handle the case where a symbolic link points to a file or directory outside of the root directory. This causes the `ValueError` to be raised when trying to make the resolved path relative to the root directory.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where the resolved path is outside of the root directory. We can catch the `ValueError` and continue processing the next file if the resolved path is a symbolic link and is outside of the root directory.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            raise

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, a `ValueError` is caught, and if the current file is a symbolic link and points outside of the root directory, the loop continues to the next file without raising an exception.
