Potential error location: The potential error is in the construction of the `normalized_path` variable. It is concatenating a "/" with the normalized path which could cause issues when matching the `exclude` regex and `include` regex.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the normalized_path is being constructed incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect matching of the regex patterns.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of concatenating "/", we can use the `as_posix()` method of the `child` path to convert it to a posix-style path and then apply the regex patterns for `exclude` and `include`.

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path
from report import Report

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
