Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the exclusion logic, as the bug may be related to how the exclusion regex is being applied to the file paths.

Reason for the bug:
The bug may be occurring because the exclusion regex is not being properly applied to the file paths. This could be due to the way the regex is being used or how the paths are normalized.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the exclusion regex is correctly applied to the file paths and that the paths are normalized properly before checking them against the regex patterns.

Corrected code:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Iterator, Pattern

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            normalized_path = child.resolve().relative_to(root)
            if not exclude.search(normalized_path.as_posix()) and include.search(normalized_path.as_posix()):
                yield child
```
In the corrected code, we removed the unnecessary normalization of the path and simplified the logic for applying the include and exclude regex patterns to the file paths. Now, the function should properly generate all files that are included by the `include` regex and not excluded by the `exclude` regex.
