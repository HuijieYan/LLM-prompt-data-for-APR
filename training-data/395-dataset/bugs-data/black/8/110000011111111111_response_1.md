Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the buggy function `bracket_split_build_line()` is not handling the inclusion of comments properly, specifically when including multi-line imports. This is causing the resulting formatted code to be invalid.

The potential error location within the function is likely the handling of comments when constructing the new line with the given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case where multi-line imports are included with comments. This results in the incorrect formatting of the code, leading to the invalid output.

To fix the bug, the function `bracket_split_build_line()` should be modified to correctly handle multi-line imports with comments. Specifically, it should ensure that comments are properly included and formatted when constructing the new line.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line()` function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

The corrected function should now properly handle multi-line imports with comments and construct the new line accordingly. This should resolve the bug related to the invalid code output.
