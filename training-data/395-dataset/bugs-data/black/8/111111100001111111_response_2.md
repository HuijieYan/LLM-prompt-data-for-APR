The buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` seems to be producing invalid code when dealing with commented-out multi-line includes, as reported in the provided GitHub issue.

The reason behind the bug could be due to the incorrect handling of comments and the addition of trailing commas after the last item in the import statement. When the import statement contains comments after certain elements, the function fails to properly handle them and produce valid output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle comments and the addition of trailing commas when expected. Additionally, it should consider the presence of comments and adjust the formatting accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
        leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1] != Leaf(token.COMMA, ","):
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This corrected code should handle the inclusion of comments and trailing commas more effectively, ensuring that it produces valid code for multi-line imports, including the ones with comments.
