The function `bracket_split_build_line` contains multiple issues, including incorrect arguments in several function calls and unspecified variables outside the function's scope. Additionally, the function is not properly implemented. Here's the corrected function with the relevant updates:

```python
# this is the updated and fixed function
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This updated version should fix the issues with the original function. Additionally, please thoroughly test the function to ensure that it produces the expected results and does not raise any errors or exceptions.
