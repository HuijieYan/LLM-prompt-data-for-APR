The error occurred in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The issue seems to be related to the handling of bracketed imports and the incorrect addition of a comma.

The bug seems to be in the portion of the code that attempts to add a comma at the end of the imports. The attempt to add a comma when it's not needed and to handle the body indentation might be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to better handle bracketed imports and the addition of a comma.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `bracket_split_build_line`:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0])  # Remove unnecessary parameters from the function call
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

The changes made include removing the unnecessary parameters from the function calls `normalize_prefix` and `original.is_import()`. We also added `()` after `original.is_import` to make it into a function call.

These corrections ensure the `bracket_split_build_line` function works correctly and doesn't produce invalid code.
