The error seems to occur when the `BracketTracker` class is used to format multi-line import statements with trailing comments. It seems that the function `bracket_split_build_line` is not handling the case of multi-line import statements with comments properly, leading to the production of invalid code.

The potential error location within the function is the logic for handling trailing commas and comments in multi-line import statements. It seems that the function is not properly handling the addition of a trailing comma when it's required or normalizing the prefix for the first leaf inside brackets with comments.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to how the function fails to correctly handle the logic for adding trailing commas and normalizing prefixes in multi-line import statements with comments. This results in the invalid code output reported in the error message.

To fix this bug, the `bracket_split_build_line` function needs to be updated to properly handle the cases of multi-line import statements with comments. Specifically, it should handle the addition of a trailing comma when necessary, and normalize the prefix for the first leaf inside brackets with comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List
from typing import Type

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This corrected code includes the proper handling for adding trailing commas and normalizing prefixes in multi-line import statements with comments, ensuring that the function does not produce invalid code.
