Potential error location: The bug may be occurring in the 'normalize_prefix' function, which is called on 'leaves[0]' when 'is_body' is true. Additionally, there may be an issue with the check for a trailing comma when 'original.is_import' is true.

Reasons for the bug: It seems that the 'normalize_prefix' function is not functioning as expected, and the logic for checking and adding a trailing comma may be incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the implementation of the 'normalize_prefix' function to ensure it effectively removes leading whitespace and adjusts the prefix as intended.
2. Review the logic for adding a trailing comma when 'original.is_import' is true to ensure it correctly handles the addition of the comma.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import List
from typing import TypeVar, Generic
from line import Leaf, Line
from token import token

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            leaves[0].prefix = ""  # Updated to remove leading whitespace
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))  # Updated to add a comma if it's missing
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
