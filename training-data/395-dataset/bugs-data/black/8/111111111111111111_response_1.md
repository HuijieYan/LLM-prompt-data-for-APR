The error is likely occurring in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The error message indicates that the produced code is invalid, and it points to a specific line in the file `black.py`. It seems that the function is not handling the comments and formatting of the code correctly, resulting in the invalid output.

The potential reason behind the bug could be the mishandling of comments and formatting when building a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from the `original` line. This could be causing the invalid syntax and leading to the error reported in the test case.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that comments are properly handled and formatted when building the new line. This may involve accounting for the proper placement of comments and ensuring that the code produced is valid Python syntax.

Here's the corrected version of the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            # Normalize the prefix of the first leaf when inside brackets.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the normalization of the leaf's prefix and the addition of a trailing comma when expected. Additionally, we ensure that comments are properly appended to the result line.

This corrected version should address the bug and produce valid Python code.
