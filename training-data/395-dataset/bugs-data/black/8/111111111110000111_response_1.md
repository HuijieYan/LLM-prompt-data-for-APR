The error message indicates an "AssertionError" in the test function "test_comments7" from the file "test_black.py" at line 395. The error message suggests that the produced output from the function "fs" is not equal to the expected output. This implies that the function "fs" is not producing the expected result, which could be due to the buggy function "bracket_split_build_line" from the file "black.py."

Looking at the "bracket_split_build_line" function, the bug could be occurring due to the following reasons:
1. The "normalize_prefix" function is being called with incorrect parameters.
2. There might be an issue with the calculation of the "is_body" flag, causing incorrect conditional execution of the code.
3. The "append" method is being called with incorrect parameters.
4. The "should_explode" function is being called incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the following actions could be taken:
1. Correct the parameters passed to the "normalize_prefix" function.
2. Verify the logic for setting the "is_body" flag.
3. Check if the "append" method is being called with the correct parameters.
4. Verify the usage of the "should_explode" function.

Here's the corrected code for the "bracket_split_build_line" function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_8/black.py

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.
    
    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    result.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

The corrected code includes:
1. Calling the "is_import" function correctly with empty parameters.
2. Using the "comments_after" function directly without "original."
3. Ensure that "append" method is being called without a reference to "self."
4. Ensuring that "should_explode" function is called correctly with the "result" line.
