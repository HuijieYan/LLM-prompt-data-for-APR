The error message is showing an assertion error in the `assertFormatEqual` method. The error is indicating that the expected output and the actual output are not matching, and the difference is related to the import statement with respect to adding commas.

The issue in the original function seems to be related to the addition of commas for import statements. The bug could be that the function is not adding a comma after the last import statement.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that a trailing comma is added after each import statement.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import List
import token

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                for leaf in leaves[:-1]:
                    result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
                    for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
                        result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
                    result.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","), preformatted=True)
                # Append the last import statement with a trailing comma
                leaf = leaves[-1]
                result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
                for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
                    result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    result.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","), preformatted=True)
    else:
        # Populate the line without modifications
        for leaf in leaves:
            result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
            for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
                result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
            
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, when `is_body` is True, the function iterates through all the import statements except the last one and ensures that a trailing comma is added after each import. Then, it appends the last import statement with a trailing comma. This change fixes the bug related to adding commas for import statements.
