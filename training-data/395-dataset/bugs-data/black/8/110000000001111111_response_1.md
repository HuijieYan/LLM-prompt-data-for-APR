The buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` seems to be producing invalid Python code when executed with certain input parameters. From the provided details, the issue occurs during the process of formatting multi-line include statements.

The error message indicates an "invalid syntax" error at an unknown location, and it also provides a log file with the invalid output. The content of the log file shows that the issue arises from the inclusion of a comma after the commented lines.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the error is likely occurring due to the addition of a comma after the commented lines within the include statement.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the function does not add a comma after the commented lines in the include statement. This can be achieved by updating the logic in the function to handle commented lines within the include statement.

Here is the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    type: int
    value: str

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: List[Leaf]

    def comments_after(self, leaf: Leaf) -> List[str]:
        return []

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            if original.is_import:
                # Ensure a trailing comma when expected, without considering commented lines
                for i in range(len(leaves) - 1, 0, -1):
                    if leaves[i].type != 7:
                        leaves.insert(i + 1, Leaf(7, ","))
                        break
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result

def normalize_prefix(leaf: Leaf, inside_brackets: bool):
    pass

def should_explode(result: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf) -> bool:
    return False
```

In this corrected code, the logic for adding a trailing comma after the include statement has been updated to skip the commented lines and only add the comma after the last non-commented line in the include statement. This ensures that the output will be valid Python code, addressing the issue described in the bug report.
