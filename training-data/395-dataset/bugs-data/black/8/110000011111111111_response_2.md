The test case `test_comments7` is failing with an AssertionError. The function `assertFormatEqual` is comparing the expected and actual outputs and raising an AssertionError because the expected output does not match the actual output.

The error message from the failing test case states that Black produced invalid code with invalid syntax. The test case input includes a multi-line import statement with comments at the end of each line. It seems that the bug is related to the formatting of multi-line import statements with comments.

The bug is likely occurring in the function `bracket_split_build_line` because it is responsible for handling comments in the context of import statements within the given input.

To fix the bug, the `bracket_split_build_line` function should be modified to correctly handle the formatting of multi-line import statements with comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body and leaves:  # Adjust should_explode only for non-empty bodies
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This corrected function ensures that the provided input of multi-line import statements with comments is properly handled, preventing the occurrence of invalid code.
