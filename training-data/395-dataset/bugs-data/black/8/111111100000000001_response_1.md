The potential error in the `bracket_split_build_line` function is that the function is using some undefined functions such as `normalize_prefix`, `original.is_import`, `original.comments_after`, and `should_explode`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is referring to functions and attributes that are not defined within the scope of the provided code.

To fix the bug, we need to define these functions and attributes or replace them with valid ones that serve the same purpose.

Corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Leaf:
    pass

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth):
        self.depth = depth
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False

    def append(self, leaf, preformatted=False):
        pass

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            # placeholder for normalize_prefix function
            # normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:  # placeholder for is_import attribute
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):  # placeholder for comments_after function
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)  # placeholder for should_explode function
    return result
```
