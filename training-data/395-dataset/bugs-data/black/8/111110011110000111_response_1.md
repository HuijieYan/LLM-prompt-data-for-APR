The error message from the test function indicates that Black is producing invalid code with commented out multi-line includes. The comparison of the expected and actual results fails due to a trailing comma being added before the closing bracket in the output.

Based on the error message, the issue seems to be related to the addition of an extra trailing comma when there shouldn't be one. This behavior is likely caused by the logic related to adding a trailing comma in the `bracket_split_build_line` function.

To fix this bug, the logic for adding a trailing comma inside the `bracket_split_build_line` function should be corrected. The logic should be updated to ensure that a trailing comma is added only when necessary, based on the context and structure of the code (e.g., when it's not the last item in an import statement). Additionally, the handling of comments and their association with the leaves should also be carefully considered to ensure correct reconstruction of the line.

The corrected function `bracket_split_build_line` is provided below:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from tokenize import TokenInfo

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type: TokenInfo, value: str) -> None:
        self.type = type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int) -> None:
        self.depth = depth
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False
        self.is_import = False

    def append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool) -> None:
        pass  # Placeholder implementation
        

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In this corrected version of the `bracket_split_build_line` function, the logic for adding a trailing comma to the leaves list based on the context of import statements has been updated. This change should prevent the addition of unnecessary trailing commas, addressing the issue described in the test function and the associated error message.
