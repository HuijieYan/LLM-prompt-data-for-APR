The error message provided is related to a specific test case "test_comments7" failing with an "AssertionError". The error message suggests that the function "assertFormatEqual" is failing because the expected output and the actual output are not equal.

After analyzing the error message and the associated test case, it seems that the issue could be related to the incorrect handling of comments and multi-line includes in the `bracket_split_build_line` function.

The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrect processing of imports within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. Specifically, it looks like the function is not handling multi-line imports with comments correctly, resulting in a different output than expected, thereby failing the test case.

To address this bug, one approach could be to modify the `bracket_split_build_line` function to properly handle multi-line imports and comments. This might involve parsing the original input and ensuring that the structure of multi-line includes with comments is preserved in the newly generated line.

Here's the corrected version of the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type, value):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth):
        self.depth = depth
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False
        self.is_import = False
        self.leaves = []

def normalize_prefix(leaf, inside_brackets):
    # Your implementation of normalize_prefix

def should_explode(result, opening_bracket):
    # Your implementation of should_explode
    return False

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                last_leaf_type = leaves[-1].type if leaves else None
                if last_leaf_type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.leaves.append(leaf)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.leaves.append(comment_after)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In this corrected code, the `bracket_split_build_line` function has been modified to handle multi-line imports and comments properly. Additionally, it ensures that the expected structure of the code is preserved when generating the new line.
