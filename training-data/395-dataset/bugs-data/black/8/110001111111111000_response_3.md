The buggy function is `bracket_split_build_line`, and it needs to be fixed based on the provided input and expected output. The issue seems to be related to the `normalize_prefix` function, where the `inside_brackets` parameter is not being passed correctly.

Here's the corrected `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=result.inside_brackets)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

There were some issues found in the original function, so here's a corrected version based on the provided input and expected output. The errors in the input parameters and expected outcome have been addressed for `bracket_split_build_line` function.
