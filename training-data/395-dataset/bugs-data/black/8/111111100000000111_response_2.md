The error message indicates that the problematic function is causing Black to produce invalid code when handling commented out multi-line includes. The test case provided also shows an example of such a multi-line include with comments.

Upon analyzing the provided code and associated error message, it appears that the issue is related to the `bracket_split_build_line` function. It seems that the function does not handle the scenario of commented out multi-line includes properly, leading to the production of invalid code by Black.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the mishandling of comments and multi-line includes within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The function should properly account for comments and handle multi-line includes, including commented out lines, while constructing the resulting line.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the `bracket_split_build_line` function to handle comments and multi-line includes correctly. This may involve checking for commented out lines and adjusting the line construction process accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the function checks for the `is_import` condition properly and adds a trailing comma if necessary. Additionally, it properly handles comments by appending them to the new line.

This should resolve the bug related to producing invalid code with commented out multi-line includes in Black.
