The error is occurring when the `bracket_split_build_line` function in the `black.py` file is attempting to format a Python file, and there are commented out multi-line includes in the file. The error message indicates that Black is producing invalid code.

The potential error location within the `bracket_split_build_line` function is the condition `if original.is_import`. This condition is attempting to check if the `original` Line is an import line, but `original` is an instance of the `Line` class and does not have an `is_import` attribute or method.

The bug occurs because the `bracket_split_build_line` function is incorrectly attempting to access an `is_import` attribute on the `original` Line instance, which leads to an AttributeError and causes the invalid code to be produced.

To fix this bug, the `is_import` attribute check needs to be removed from the `bracket_split_build_line` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Commented out the following line as it is unnecessary and causing issues
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            # if original.is_import:
            #     if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
            #         leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
``` 

The correction involves removing the unnecessary check for `original.is_import` and the subsequent conditional block related to it. This will prevent the AttributeError and ensure that the function operates correctly without producing invalid code.
