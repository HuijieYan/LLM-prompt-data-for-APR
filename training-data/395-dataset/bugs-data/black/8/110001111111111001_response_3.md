The test case `test_comments7` is failing with an assertion error. The expected and actual values do not match, and the error message shows the differences between the two strings.

The buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` processes the leaves and builds a new line with respective comments from the original line. It also adds indentation and trailing commas when necessary. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation and trailing commas.

The error message indicates that there is a difference in the expected and actual values at specific locations, particularly regarding the placement of commas.

To fix the bug:
1. Review the logic for adding indentation and trailing commas in the `bracket_split_build_line` function.
2. Check how the `is_body` flag is being used to add indentation when necessary.
3. Ensure that the trailing comma is added correctly based on the conditions specified in the function's docstring.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            if original.is_import() and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the logic for adding indentation and trailing commas has been reviewed and modified to adhere to the expected behavior. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing test case.
