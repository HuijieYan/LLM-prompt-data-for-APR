The error message indicates that the expected output and the actual output are not matching. The error seems to be related to the addition of a comma after the element "no_comma_here_yet".

Upon analyzing the input parameters for the buggy function, it appears that when the "is_body" parameter is True, a comma is being added after the last element in the list "leaves" without considering the comments after that element. This is causing an incorrect addition of a comma and a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, the addition of the comma after the last element in the list "leaves" should only be done if there are no comments after that element. 

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import tokenize
from tokenize import TokenInfo
from typing import Optional

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type: int, value: str):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int, leaves: List[Leaf], comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets: bool, should_explode: bool):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.should_explode = should_explode

    def append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool):
        pass

    def comments_after(self, leaf: Leaf):
        pass

    @property
    def is_import(self):
        for leaf in self.leaves:
            if leaf.type == tokenize.NAME and leaf.value == "import":
                return True
        return False

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                next_leaf_index = leaves.index(opening_bracket) + 1
                if next_leaf_index < len(leaves) and leaves[next_leaf_index].type != tokenize.COMMA:
                    if not original.comments_after(leaves[next_leaf_index]):
                        leaves.append(Leaf(tokenize.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the check for adding the trailing comma has been modified to ensure that it is only added if there are no comments after the element in the "leaves" list. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output.
