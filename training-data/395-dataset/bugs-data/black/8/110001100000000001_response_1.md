The potential error in the `bracket_split_build_line` function is the usage of `normalize_prefix` and `original.is_import`, which seems to be incorrectly referencing methods of the `Line` class. These are likely supposed to be methods of the `Leaf` class instead.

To fix the bug, we need to update the references to `normalize_prefix` and `original.is_import` to correctly use the `Leaf` class instead of the `Line` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0])  # Removed incorrect parameter
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if is_import(leaves[-1]):  # Corrected method call from original.is_import to is_import
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in comments_after(result, leaf):  # Corrected method call from original.comments_after to comments_after
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
In the corrected code, the `normalize_prefix` method call is updated to correctly reference the `Leaf` class, and the `original.is_import` and `original.comments_after` method calls are updated to use the correct methods from the previous definitions provided in the source code.
