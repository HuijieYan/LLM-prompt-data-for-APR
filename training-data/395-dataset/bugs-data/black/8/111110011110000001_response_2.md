The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected and actual results. The test case `test_comments7` is checking the equality of the expected and actual results, and it fails at the assertion point.

The potential error in the provided function is in the `bracket_split_build_line` function where it handles the condition for adding a trailing comma when `original.is_import` is True. The logic for adding a comma seems incorrect and is likely causing the mismatch in the test result.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the logic for adding a comma is not properly implemented, causing an inconsistency in the results.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for adding a trailing comma when `original.is_import` is True and when the last leaf does not have a comma. We should also ensure that the test case `test_comments7` is expecting the correct result.

The corrected `bracket_split_build_line` function is provided below:

```python
from typing import List
from tokenize import TokenInfo

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[TokenInfo], original: TokenInfo, opening_bracket: TokenInfo, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> List[TokenInfo]:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = []
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf)
        if is_body:
            if original.type == token.NAME:
                if not original.string.endswith(','):
                    result.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    return result
```

This corrected function eliminates the previous logic for handling indentation and trailing commas inside brackets, and focuses on returning the correct list of leaves based on the provided input. The issue related to the trailing comma is addressed within the function.
