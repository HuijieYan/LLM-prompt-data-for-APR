The error message is related to the incorrect formatting of multi-line includes with comments when using the Python code formatting tool Black. The error message indicates that Black is producing invalid code with invalid syntax, specifically related to the formatting of the multi-line includes.

Upon analyzing the provided code, the potential error within the problematic function is likely related to the handling of comments in multi-line includes. This is indicated by the error message showing differences in the output related to multi-line includes with comments.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect handling of comments in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The function did not properly handle comments when constructing a new line with the respective comments from the original.

To fix the bug, the `bracket_split_build_line` function needs to be modified to correctly handle comments when constructing a new line. This includes ensuring that comments are properly appended to the respective leaves in the new line.

Below is the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import tokenize

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type: Optional[int], value: str):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int):
        self.depth = depth
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False
        self.leaves = []

    def append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool):
        self.leaves.append((leaf, preformatted))

def normalize_prefix(leaf: Leaf, inside_brackets: bool):
    pass

def should_explode(line: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf):
    pass

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.inside_brackets:  # Check if the original line is inside brackets
                if leaves[-1].type != tokenize.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(tokenize.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        comments = original.comments_after(leaf)
        for comment_after in comments:
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    return result
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `Line` class represents a line with depth, inside brackets indication, and leaves. The `Leaf` class represents a token with type and value.
2. The `bracket_split_build_line` function correctly appends comments to the respective leaves in the new line.
3. It checks whether the `original` line is inside brackets when ensuring a trailing comma, in accordance with the behavior described in the function's docstring. If it is inside brackets, the function appends a comma if the last leaf is not a comma.

This corrected code should address the bug related to the incorrect formatting of multi-line includes with comments in the `bracket_split_build_line` function.
