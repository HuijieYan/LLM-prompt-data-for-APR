The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `assertFormatEqual` method of the test case. It shows that the expected and actual outputs do not match, pointing to a specific line where the mismatch is occurring.

Upon reviewing the error message, it seems that the bug is likely related to the `bracket_split_build_line` function, specifically the portion that deals with adding a trailing comma in the body of the line when `original.is_import` is True. It appears that the logic for adding the trailing comma may not be working correctly, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The potential reason for the bug could be that the logic to add the trailing comma is not properly implemented, causing the actual output to differ from the expected output.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for adding the trailing comma in the body of the line when `original.is_import` is True. Additionally, we should ensure that the function handles different scenarios properly to avoid assertion errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    return result
```

The corrected function adds the trailing comma when expected in the body of the line, ensuring that the logic is properly implemented to avoid assertion errors in the test case.
