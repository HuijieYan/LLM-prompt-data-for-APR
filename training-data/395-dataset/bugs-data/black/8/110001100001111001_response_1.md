It appears that the function `bracket_split_build_line` is designed to create a new line with certain formatting given a set of input variables. It manipulates the `result` and `leaves` variables inside a loop, and updates the `result` variable based on conditions inside the loop.

The bug in this function is likely due to using the `append` function incorrectly. The `result.append` method is being called with the `preformatted` argument set to `True`, but the function `append` does not have a `preformatted` argument based on the given signatures.

To fix the bug, the `append` method should be called without the `preformatted` argument.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    
    return result
```
