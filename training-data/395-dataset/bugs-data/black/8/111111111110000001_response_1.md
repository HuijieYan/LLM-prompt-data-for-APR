The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` method is called in the test. The error message indicates that the expected result and the actual result do not match. This suggests that the `bracket_split_build_line` function is not producing the expected output.

The potential error location within the `bracket_split_build_line` function is in the following lines:
```python
        if original.is_import:
            if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
```
The if condition `if original.is_import:` seems like it should be calling the `is_import` function, but it's directly referencing `is_import` as an attribute of `original`, which is not the correct way to call a method.

Based on this analysis, the bug seems to be caused by improper method calls and attribute references within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. To fix this, the correct way to call the `is_import` function should be used, and the proper attribute should be accessed from `original` to see if the function behaves correctly. Additionally, potential debugging or logging statements can be added to track the behavior of the function and identify any further issues.

Here is the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if is_import(original):
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in comments_after(original, leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
