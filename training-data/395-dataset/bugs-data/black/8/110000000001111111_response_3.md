The bug seems to be occurring due to the handling of comments and trailing commas inside the function `bracket_split_build_line`. The issue can be related to how the comments and commas are being appended to the result line.

The buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` seems to be appending the comments and commas incorrectly. One possible reason for the failure is the improper handling of comments and commas while populating the result line.

To fix this bug, it is important to correctly handle the appending of comments and commas while populating the result line. The logic for adding trailing commas and comments should be carefully reviewed to ensure that they are correctly placed in the result line.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line with leaves and respective comments
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In this corrected code, the handling of comments and commas while populating the result line has been adjusted to ensure that they are correctly placed. This fix should resolve the issue with producing invalid code.
