The error message provided in the GitHub issue suggests that the bug occurs when black (the Python code formatter) produces invalid code with commented out multi-line includes. The specific error "INTERNAL ERROR: Black produced invalid code: invalid syntax" indicates that the formatting logic within the black tool encountered an issue when dealing with commented out multi-line includes.

Upon examining the buggy function `bracket_split_build_line`, it seems that the bug could potentially be related to the handling of comments and formatting within the function, as it manipulates the leaves and their respective comments from the original line.

One potential reason for the bug could be the mishandling of comments and trailing comma when a line is one-indented inside brackets (as indicated by the `is_body` parameter).

To fix the bug, it is recommended to carefully handle the comments, prefixes, and trailing comma within the `bracket_split_build_line` function to ensure that it correctly handles the formatting of multiline includes and other similar scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List
import token

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List, original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            if inside_brackets:
                # Remove spurious leading whitespace
                leaves[0].normalize_prefix()
                if original.is_import:
                    if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- The syntax of the function parameters has been updated to match the actual data types and imports used in the function.
- The `normalize_prefix` function has been used to ensure proper handling of whitespace and prefixes.
- The handling of trailing commas has been revised to address the specific scenario of multiline includes.

This corrected code aims to improve the handling of comments and formatting to address the bug related to invalid code output by black.
