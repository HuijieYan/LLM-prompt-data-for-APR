Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be in the "bracket_split_build_line" function when trying to call the "normalize_prefix" function without the correct parameters.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The "normalize_prefix" function is called with a "leaves[0]" parameter, but the "inside_brackets" parameter is missing. This is likely causing a syntax error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Add the "inside_brackets" parameter to the "normalize_prefix" function call, and ensure that all parameters are passed correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import List

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, value, type):
        self.value = value
        self.type = type

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth):
        self.depth = depth
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False
        self.is_import = False
        self.leaves = []

    def append(self, leaf, preformatted):
        self.leaves.append(leaf)

def normalize_prefix(leaf: Leaf, inside_brackets: bool = False) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def should_explode(line: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such

    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
