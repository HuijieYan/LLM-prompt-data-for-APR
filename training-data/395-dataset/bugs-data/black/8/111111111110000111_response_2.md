The error message from the test function is asserting that the expected and actual outputs are not equal. This indicates that the function `bracket_split_build_line` is not producing the expected output, leading to a failed test case.

The potential error location within the function `bracket_split_build_line` is likely the conditional block that handles adding a trailing comma when `original.is_import` is True. It's possible that this block is not functioning as expected, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be the mishandling or incorrect logic in adding a trailing comma when `original.is_import` is True. This could lead to a difference between the expected and actual outputs, causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic for adding a trailing comma when `original.is_import` is True should be carefully reviewed and corrected if necessary.

Here's the corrected `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0])  # Remove unnecessary arguments
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():  # Add parentheses to method call
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))  # Add trailing comma

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    return result
```

In the corrected code:
1. The unnecessary argument `inside_brackets` in `normalize_prefix` has been removed, as it is not required.
2. The method call `original.is_import` has been changed to `original.is_import()` with parentheses, assuming it's a method call.
3. The condition for adding a trailing comma has been adjusted to ensure it works as intended.
