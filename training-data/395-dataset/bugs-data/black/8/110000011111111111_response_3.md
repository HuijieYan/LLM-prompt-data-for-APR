## Analysis
The error message indicates that Black produced invalid code when formatting a test file. The specific issue seems to be related to the commented out multi-line includes in the test file. The function `bracket_split_build_line` is likely the cause of this issue, as it deals with formatting lines and comments.

The bug seems to be caused by the function incorrectly handling the addition of a comma after the last element in the list when formatting multi-line imports with comments.

## Reasons Behind the Bug
The bug occurs due to the function not correctly handling the addition of a comma after the last element in a list when formatting multi-line imports with comments.

It appears that the function does not properly account for the presence of comments when adding a comma after the last element in the list, leading to the production of invalid code by Black.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the function to properly handle the addition of a comma after the last element in the list when formatting multi-line imports with comments.
2. Consider adjusting the logic of the function to account for scenarios where comments are present after the elements in the list.

## Corrected Code
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from my_module import Line, Leaf, token, BracketTracker

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf],
    original: Line,
    opening_bracket: Leaf,
    *,
    is_body: bool = False,
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    last_leaf = leaves[-1]
                    # Check if the last leaf is a comment and adjust the addition of comma accordingly
                    if last_leaf.type == token.COMMENT:
                        leaves = leaves[:-1]  # Remove the comment leaf
                        last_leaf = leaves[-1]  # Get the new last leaf
                        if last_leaf.type == token.COMMA:
                            leaves[-1] = Leaf(token.COMMA, ",")
                        else:
                            leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
                    else:
                        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
In the corrected code, the handling of the addition of a comma after the last element in the list when formatting multi-line imports with comments has been updated. The function now checks if the last leaf is a comment and adjusts the addition of a comma accordingly. If the last leaf is a comment, it is removed, and the comma is added after the new last leaf. If the last leaf is not a comment, the comma is simply added after the last element.

This correction should ensure that the function properly handles multi-line imports with comments, resulting in valid code when formatted by Black.
