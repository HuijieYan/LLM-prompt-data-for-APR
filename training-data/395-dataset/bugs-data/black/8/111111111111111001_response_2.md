The error is likely due to the incorrect handling of comments and commas in the function `bracket_split_build_line`. The expected and actual outputs are not matching, which could be caused by the improper addition of commas in the result. This can lead to the assertion error in the test case.

The bug seems to occur in the handling of the `is_body` condition within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The addition of a comma after the last element in the list of leaves (`should_explode`) is not handled correctly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `bracket_split_build_line` function to include proper handling of the `should_explode` condition such that a comma is added after the last element in the list of leaves when `is_body` is True.

The corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function is as follows:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

With this modification, proper handling of the `is_body` condition and adding a comma after the last element in the list of leaves is achieved, addressing the bug in the `bracket_split_build_line` function.
