The buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` needs to be corrected. The corrected function, based on the provided inputs and expected outputs, is as follows:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            # changes from `normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)` to `normalize_prefix(leaves[0])`
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0])
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        # changes from `result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)` to `result.should_explode = should_explode(original, opening_bracket)`
        result.should_explode = should_explode(original, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
