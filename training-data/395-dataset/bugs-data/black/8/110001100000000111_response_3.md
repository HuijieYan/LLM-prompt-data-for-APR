Based on the error message and the test case provided, it seems that the issue is related to the commented out multi-line includes. The error message indicates that Black produced invalid code, specifically mentioning an "invalid syntax" on line 11.

Upon analyzing the provided function `bracket_split_build_line`, the potential error location is identified to be in the section where the trailing comma is added when expected for imports. The check `original.is_import` is used to determine whether a trailing comma should be added.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `original.is_import` does not exist and is likely a bug in the code. This could lead to an incorrect check for whether a trailing comma should be added in the imports.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the condition `original.is_import` and directly check for the last leaf in the `leaves` list whether it is a comma or not when `is_body` is True. Additionally, the condition for adding a trailing comma should be updated to work correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.
    
    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)

            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the condition for adding a trailing comma is updated to directly check whether the last leaf in the `leaves` list is a comma or not. This approach ensures that the trailing comma is added when expected and should help resolve the bug related to commented out multi-line includes.
