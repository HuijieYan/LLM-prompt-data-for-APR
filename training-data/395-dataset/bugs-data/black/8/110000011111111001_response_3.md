The error message in the `test_comments7` function shows that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs of the function.

Based on the provided error message, it seems that the bug might be related to the handling of commas in the function. The addition or removal of commas may be causing the formatting mismatch.

The reason for the bug could be that the function is not correctly handling the addition or removal of commas when expected inside the brackets, which is causing the formatting mismatch.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the addition or removal of commas when expected inside the brackets.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, leaf_type, value):
        self.type = leaf_type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments=None, bracket_tracker=None, inside_brackets=False, should_explode=False, is_import=False):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments if comments is not None else {}
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.should_explode = should_explode
        self.is_import = is_import
    
    def comments_after(self, leaf):
        return []

def bracket_split_build_line(leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:  # Assuming token.COMMA is imported
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.leaves.append(leaf)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.leaves.append(comment_after)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)  # Assuming should_explode function exists
    return result
```

In the provided corrected code, I've made some assumptions about the presence of certain functions or classes like `normalize_prefix` and `token.COMMA`. These assumptions should be replaced with the actual implementations in the codebase. Additionally, you might need to adjust the logic within the function based on the specific requirements and behavior of the surrounding code.
