The error message indicates that Black produced invalid code and that the issue occurs when attempting to format a test file that includes multi-line includes with commented lines. This suggests that the bug is related to how the function `bracket_split_build_line` handles comments and multi-line includes.

The potential error location within the `bracket_split_build_line` function is the way it handles adding a trailing comma after the last leaf when the original line is an import line and `is_body` is True.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the addition of a trailing comma after the last leaf when the original line is an import line and `is_body` is True. This results in the produced code being invalid when it contains multi-line imports with commented lines.

To fix the bug, the function `bracket_split_build_line` needs to correctly handle the addition of a trailing comma after the last leaf when `is_body` is True and the original line is an import line. Additionally, it should also handle the exclusion of the trailing comma when the original line is not an import line.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List
from tokenize import TokenInfo

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type: TokenInfo, value: str):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int):
        self.depth = depth
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False
        self.is_import = False
        self.leaves = []

    def comments_after(self, leaf):
        pass

    def append(self, leaf, preformatted):
        self.leaves.append(leaf)

def normalize_prefix(leaf, inside_brackets):
    pass

def should_explode(result, opening_bracket):
    pass

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != "COMMA":
                    leaves.append(Leaf("COMMA", ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

The corrected function now properly handles the addition of a trailing comma after the last leaf when the original line is an import line and `is_body` is True. Additionally, it handles the exclusion of the trailing comma when the original line is not an import line. This should resolve the issue with Black producing invalid code when dealing with multi-line includes and commented lines.
