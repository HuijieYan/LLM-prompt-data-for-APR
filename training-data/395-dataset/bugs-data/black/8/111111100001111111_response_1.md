The bug is most likely occurring in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The function seems to be intended to split a line with brackets into a new line, and handle comments and indentation accordingly. The error is likely due to incorrect handling of comments and brackets.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect implementation of adding a trailing comma when expected in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. This might lead to the internal error in Black, as it produces invalid code.

To fix the bug, the function should handle comments and brackets more accurately, ensuring that the resulting line is formatted correctly. Handling of comments and the addition of trailing commas needs to be done in a way that aligns with Black's formatting rules.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the logic for adding a trailing comma when expected has been adjusted to ensure that it aligns with Black's formatting rules, which should prevent the error during code formatting with Black.
