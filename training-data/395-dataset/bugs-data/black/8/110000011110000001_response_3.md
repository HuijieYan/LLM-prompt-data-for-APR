1. The test case `test_comments7` is failing with an assertion error in the `assertFormatEqual` method. The error message shows that the expected output does not match the actual output.

2. The potential error is likely in the `bracket_split_build_line` function, where the formatting of the `leaves` and comments from the `original` is not being handled correctly.

3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of comments and formatting of the `leaves` and `original` in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. This incorrect handling could result in unexpected formatting of the resulting line, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, the `bracket_split_build_line` function needs to ensure the proper handling of comments, indentation, and trailing commas when expected. Additionally, it should handle the `original` line and its comments correctly when constructing the new line with the given `leaves`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List
import token
# Corrected function
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if not original.is_import:
                leaves[-1].newline = False
                leaves[-1].type = token.COMMA
                leaves[-1].value = ","
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This corrected function ensures the proper handling of comments, indentation, and trailing commas when expected. This should address the bug in the original function and fix the failing test case.
