The issue with the `bracket_split_build_line` function seems to be due to the `is_body` condition not being properly handled. It doesn't take into account situations where the `leaves` list is empty. 

Here's the corrected `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body and leaves:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
        normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
        # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
        if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
            leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body and leaves:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This corrected function checks if `leaves` is empty before evaluating the `is_body` condition, which should resolve the issue causing the failure in the test case `test_comments7`.
