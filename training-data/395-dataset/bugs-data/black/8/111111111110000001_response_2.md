Potential Error:
The error message in the test function indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs. This suggests that the `fs` function, which should return the actual output, might not be generating the correct result.

Reason for Bug:
The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the `is_body` parameter in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The condition for adding a trailing comma might not be implemented correctly, leading to issues with the output.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_body` condition is properly handled, and the processing of the `leaves` list and adding a trailing comma is done accurately based on the condition.

Corrected Code:

```python
from typing import List
from black.line import Leaf, Line
import token

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if isinstance(original, Line) and original.is_import():
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
In the corrected code, I have made several changes:
1. Added an import statement for `token` since it is being used in the function.
2. Updated the condition for checking if `original` is an instance of `Line` and then called the `is_import` method instead of directly accessing the `is_import` attribute.
3. Specified the `is_import` method with the `self` parameter, assuming it's an instance method.

These changes address the potential issues and should resolve the bug in the `bracket_split_build_line` function.
