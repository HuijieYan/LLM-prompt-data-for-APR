The bug in the provided code is in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The bug likely occurs due to the incorrect handling of indentation and the addition of a trailing comma in the `bracket_split_build_line` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indentation and trailing comma are handled correctly based on the provided input parameters.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import List
from typing_extensions import ParamSpec, TypeVar


Leaf = TypeVar('Leaf')


class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = []
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False

    def append(self, leaf, preformatted=False):
        pass


def bracket_split_build_line(
        leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth + 1 if is_body else original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        if leaves:
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != "COMMA":
                    leaves.append(Leaf("COMMA", ","))

    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)

        # Copying comments to result (implementation of comments_after method is not provided)
        comment = original.comments_after(leaf)
        for c in comment:
            result.append(c, preformatted=True)
    
    result.should_explode = True if is_body else False
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we fixed the indentation and trailing comma logic. Also, we assumed implementation details of `Leaf` and `comments_after` method which were not provided. The `Line` class was slightly improved to showcase the attributes that might be used within the fixed function. However, it may need to be trivially extended depending on actual use cases.
