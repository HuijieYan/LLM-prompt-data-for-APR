The error message from the test function indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output. The specific difference is related to the presence or absence of commas after certain imports.

The potential error location within the function could be the logic that determines whether a trailing comma should be added when expected. This is likely where the discrepancy in the output is coming from.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of commas when importing modules. The function is not correctly adding a trailing comma when expected, leading to differences in the output compared to the expected result.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to review the logic for adding trailing commas and ensure that it correctly handles the cases where commas are and are not needed. This may involve adjusting the conditionals and handling related to commas.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA and leaves[-1].type != token.RPAR:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))  # Add trailing comma when expected
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
