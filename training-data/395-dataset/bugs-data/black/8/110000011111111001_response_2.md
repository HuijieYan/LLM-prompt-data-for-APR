The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the function `fs` in the `test_comments7` test case. The difference seems to be related to the presence of commas in the output.

Upon analyzing the function `bracket_split_build_line`, it appears that there is a conditional check for `original.is_import` before adding a comma to the output. This conditional check is likely causing the discrepancy in the test output.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to adjust the conditional check for adding a comma. Instead of checking for `original.is_import`, it might be necessary to add a comma based on the presence of elements in `leaves` when `is_body` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the conditional check for adding a comma is based on the presence of elements in `leaves` when `is_body` is True, instead of relying on `original.is_import`. This adjustment should address the discrepancy in the test output.
