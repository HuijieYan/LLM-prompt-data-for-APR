The error seems to be related to the `bracket_split_build_line` function and its interaction with the `assertFormatEqual` method from the test case. The error message indicates that Black produced invalid code, leading to an assertion error in the test.

The potential error location within the `bracket_split_build_line` function is the `normalize_prefix` method call. It seems that the `normalize_prefix` method is being called with an incorrect number of arguments.

The bug seems to be occurring because the `normalize_prefix` function is being called with the wrong number of arguments. The `normalize_prefix` function should only take a single argument, but it is being called with two arguments. 

To fix the bug, the `normalize_prefix` function should be called with the correct number of arguments.

Corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf],
    original: Line,
    opening_bracket: Leaf,
    *,
    is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            original.normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)  # Modified method call
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = original.should_explode(result, opening_bracket)  # Modified method call
    return result
```
