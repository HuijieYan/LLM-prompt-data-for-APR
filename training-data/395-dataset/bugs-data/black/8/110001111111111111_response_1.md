The error occurs because the buggy function is not properly handling the case where a trailing comma is expected for a multi-line import statement. This results in the produced output being invalid.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional check for adding a trailing comma in the case of the original line being an import statement. The logic to add the comma is not functioning properly.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case of a missing comma when `is_import` is `True` and the last leaf in `leaves` is not a comma. This causes the produced output to be invalid, leading to the error message in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should properly check if a trailing comma is needed for the specific case of an import statement and add it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

With the corrected code, the function now properly handles the case of an import statement and adds the trailing comma if necessary, ensuring that the produced output is valid.

This should address the bug and allow the function to produce the correct output without error.
