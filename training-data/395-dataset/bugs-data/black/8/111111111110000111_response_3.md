The error message from the test function indicates that the source code is being formatted in an unexpected way, resulting in an "invalid syntax" error. The issue seems to be related to multi-line imports with comments.

The problematic function is `bracket_split_build_line`, which is responsible for adding leaves and respective comments to a new line.

The bug occurs because the function is checking `original.is_import` as if it were a property, but it should be calling the `is_import` function instead.

To fix the bug, we should replace `original.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function, passing the `original` object as an argument.

```python
from typing import List

# Assuming "Leaf" and "Line" are classes defined elsewhere
class Leaf:
    pass

class Line:
    pass

def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def normalize_prefix(leaf: Leaf, inside_brackets: bool) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def should_explode(line: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf) -> bool:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=False) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def comments_after(leaf: Leaf) -> List[Leaf]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if is_import(original):
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

By calling the `is_import` function and the `comments_after` function correctly, the bug should be fixed, and the source code formatting should produce the expected results.
