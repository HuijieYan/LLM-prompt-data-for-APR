The buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` is not provided in a complete form, which makes it difficult to understand the entire context of the function and how it is being used. However, I can correct what I see in the code and provide a sample output based on the provided input and the expected value.

Based on the information provided, the `bracket_split_build_line` function needs to be fixed in order to correct the Assertion Error in the test function. Here's an attempt to update and fix the function:

```python
from typing import List
from black import Line, Leaf, BracketTracker, fs, read_data, dump_to_stderr, patch

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != ',' and leaves[-1].type != ')':
                    leaves.append(Leaf(',', ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

Please note that this is just a partial update based on the available information, and the references to functions like `normalize_prefix` and `should_explode` are placeholders. Additionally, the `black` module is imported, but the actual implementation of the functions `fs`, `dump_to_stderr`, and `read_data` are not provided here.

To further refine the fix for the `bracket_split_build_line` function and address the Assertion Error, it would be helpful to have the complete code for the function, including any helper functions and the context in which it is being used. This additional information will allow for a more accurate and specific correction to be made.
