The issue with the `bracket_split_build_line` function is that it is not handling the insertion of a comma when expected properly. This is causing a failure in the test case `test_comments7`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import List
from black import Line, Leaf, token, normalize_prefix, BracketTracker, should_explode

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In this corrected version, the condition for adding a comma at the end of the `leaves` list has been updated to include both the conditions. This should resolve the issue seen in the test case `test_comments7`.
