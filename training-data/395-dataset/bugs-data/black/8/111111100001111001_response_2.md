The buggy function here is `bracket_split_build_line()`. It takes several parameters including `leaves`, `original`, `is_body`, and `opening_bracket`.

The issue with this function is that it uses methods like `original.comments_after(leaf)` and `original.is_import` without considering that `original` is an instance of the class `Line`. These calls should be updated to `comments_after(leaf)` and `is_import` respectively.

Additionally, the function tries to access attributes like `should_explode` and `inside_brackets` directly on the `Line` object `result`. But `should_explode` is not a direct attribute of the `Line` object, and `inside_brackets` should be accessed as `result.inside_brackets`. These need to be updated as well.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        should_explode = should_explode_line(result, opening_bracket)  # Adjust the should_explode function call
        result.should_explode = should_explode
    return result
```
