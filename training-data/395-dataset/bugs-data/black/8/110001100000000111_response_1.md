The bug is likely occurring due to the `bracket_split_build_line` function in the Black library. The function seems to be related to formatting multi-line imports, and the bug seems to occur when there are commented-out lines within the import.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of commented lines within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. When there are commented-out lines within the import statement, the function fails to handle them properly, resulting in an invalid output.

To fix the bug, the `bracket_split_build_line` function should be modified to handle commented-out lines within the import statement properly. Specifically, it should be able to differentiate between actual import lines and commented lines and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
        leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.
    
    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `is_import` function is called as a method (`original.is_import()`) instead of as a standalone function. This change ensures proper checking for import lines, which should address the bug related to commented-out lines within the import statement.
