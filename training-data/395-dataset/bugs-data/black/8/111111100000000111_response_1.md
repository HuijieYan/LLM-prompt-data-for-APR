Based on the error message and the associated test case, the bug most likely occurs due to the commented out lines within the import statement. When the import statement is processed by the `bracket_split_build_line` function, it fails to handle the commented out lines correctly, leading to the invalid output.

To fix this bug, the `bracket_split_build_line` function needs to be modified to handle commented out lines in imports correctly. The function should detect and ignore the commented out lines within the import statement while still maintaining the correct formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
        leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                # Filter out the commented lines before adding them to the result
                non_commented_leaves = [leaf for leaf in leaves if leaf.type != token.COMMENT]
                # Check if there are any non-commented lines left
                if non_commented_leaves and non_commented_leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    non_commented_leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
                leaves = non_commented_leaves
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected function, we filter out the commented lines before deciding whether to add the trailing comma. This ensures that the commented lines are ignored when determining the formatting of the import statement.
