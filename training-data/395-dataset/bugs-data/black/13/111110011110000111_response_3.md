The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the string '#!/usr/bin/env python3.7\n\ndef f():\n    return (i*2 async for i in arange(42))\n'. This string contains the phrase 'async for', which is causing a problem with parsing.

The given function 'generate_tokens' is quite complex and is intended for tokenizing Python source code. However, it seems that the tokenizer does not handle the 'async for' construct correctly. This is causing the test case to fail, as it is encountering an issue while parsing the 'async for' statement.

To fix the bug, the 'generate_tokens' function needs to be modified to correctly handle the 'async for' construct in Python code. This will involve updating the logic inside the tokenizer to recognize and handle the 'async for' tokens correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the 'generate_tokens' function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    lnum = parenlev = continued = 0
    numchars = '0123456789'
    contstr, needcont = '', 0
    contline = None
    indents = [0]

    stashed = None
    async_def = False
    async_def_indent = 0
    async_def_nl = False
    async_for = False

    while True:
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum += 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)

        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

        if not parenlev and not continued:  # new statement
            if not line:
                break
            column = 0
            while pos < max:  # measure leading whitespace
                if line[pos] == ' ':
                    column += 1
                elif line[pos] == '\t':
                    column = (column // tabsize + 1) * tabsize
                elif line[pos] == '\f':
                    column = 0
                else:
                    break
                pos += 1
            if pos == max:
                break

            # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

            if async_for:
                async_for = False
                yield (ASYNC, "async", (lnum, pos), (lnum, pos + 5), line)
                yield (FOR, "for", (lnum, pos + 6), (lnum, pos + 9), line)

            # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    for indent in indents[1:]:  # pop remaining indent levels
        yield (DEDENT, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
    yield (ENDMARKER, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
```

In the updated function, the occurrence of the 'async for' construct is handled separately, and appropriate tokens (ASYNC and FOR) are yielded for the 'async' and 'for' keywords.

After making this change, the function should be able to correctly tokenize Python source code containing the 'async for' construct, addressing the issue reported in the test case.
