The potential error location within the `generate_tokens` function is the `except StopIteration` block, where `line = ''` is assigned as a default value when `readline` is exhausted.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `StopIteration` exception block is not properly handled, leading to an unexpected behavior when the `readline()` function is exhausted.

To fix the bug, the exception handling for the `StopIteration` should be revised to set a default value for `line` only if it is exhausted. A more appropriate approach is to use an if-else statement to check if the `line` is empty before incrementing the `lnum` and setting the `pos` and `max` variables.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_tokens` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (previous code)

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
            if not line:
                break

        if line.strip():  # check if line is not empty or only contains whitespace
            lnum = lnum + 1
            # other processing logic for the line
```

In the corrected code, after handling the `StopIteration` exception, an if statement is used to check if the line is not empty or only contains whitespace. If it meets the condition, the relevant processing logic is applied. Otherwise, the loop breaks. This approach ensures that the `lnum` is only incremented when a non-empty line is encountered.
