The potential error in the provided code is that the 'endmatch' variable is being used before it is defined within the 'if not contstr' block.

The 'endmatch' variable is defined after the 'if not contstr' block, so when the 'if not contstr' block is executed, the 'endmatch' variable has not been defined yet which leads to an UnboundLocalError.

To fix this issue, the 'endmatch' variable should be defined before the 'if not contstr' block so that it can be used within that block without any issues.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import collections.abc

def generate_tokens(readline):
    """
    The generate_tokens() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile).next    # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found. The line passed is the
    logical line; continuation lines are included.
    """
    Token = collections.namedtuple('Token', ['type', 'string', 'srow_scol', 'erow_ecol', 'line'])

    lnum = parenlev = continued = 0
    numchars = '0123456789'
    contstr, needcont = '', 0
    contline = None
    indents = [0]

    # 'stashed' and 'async_*' are used for async/await parsing
    stashed = None
    async_def = False
    async_def_indent = 0
    async_def_nl = False

    while True:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum += 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)
        
        endmatch = None  # Define endmatch here

        if not contstr and endmatch:  # continued string
            if not line:
                raise TokenError("EOF in multi-line string", strstart)
```
This correction includes the use of named tuple 'Token' from module 'collections' and initializes 'endmatch' with 'None' value to prevent the 'UnboundLocalError'. This correction will also improve the readability and maintainability of the code for future use.
