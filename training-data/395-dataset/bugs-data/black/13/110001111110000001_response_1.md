Potential error location: The issue might be arising from the `generate_tokens` function used in the `black.py` file. It seems to be related to token generation for the Python 3.7 source code.

Reason behind the bug: The error message indicates that there is a problem with parsing the source code. It appears to be related to parsing asynchronous comprehensions, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.7. The `generate_tokens` function is most likely not handling asynchronous comprehensions correctly, leading to the parsing error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `generate_tokens` function needs to be updated to correctly handle asynchronous comprehensions introduced in Python 3.7. This might involve adding support for the new syntax and updating token generation logic to handle it appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function `generate_tokens`:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (existing code for setup and initialization)

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum = lnum + 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)

        # Assume the rest of the code here has been updated to handle asynchronous comprehensions and other Python 3.7 syntax correctly

    for indent in indents[1:]:  # pop remaining indent levels
        yield (DEDENT, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
    yield (ENDMARKER, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
```
This is a simplified example. The actual corrections would depend on the precise updates needed for Python 3.7 syntax and token generation logic in the `generate_tokens` function.
