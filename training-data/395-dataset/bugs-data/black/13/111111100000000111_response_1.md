Potential error location: The code appears to be having issues with parsing async/await constructs, especially when they are used within a list comprehension.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the function is not handling async/await constructs within list comprehensions properly, leading to parsing errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the code to properly handle async/await constructs within list comprehensions.
2. Implement a mechanism to detect and parse async/await constructs within list comprehensions separately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    """
    The generate_tokens() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile).next    # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found. The line passed is the
    logical line; continuation lines are included.
    """
    # Previous code remains unchanged

    if line[pos:pos+6] == ' async':
        yield (ASYNC, 'async', spos, (lnum, pos+6), line)
        pos += 6

    # After parsing async/await constructs in the code, the remaining code remains unchanged

```
