The potential error in the given function is the incorrect use of indentation, which can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect indentation within the function. The code does not follow the Python indentation rules, and this can lead to errors in the program's behavior.

To fix the bug, the indentation within the function should follow the Python standard indentation of four spaces for each level of indentation.

Here's the corrected code for the given function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    lnum = parenlev = continued = 0
    numchars = '0123456789'
    contstr, needcont = '', 0
    contline = None
    indents = [0]

    while True:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum = lnum + 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)

        # Rest of the code remains the same, ensuring correct indentation
        # ...
        # ...
```

In the corrected code, the indentation has been fixed to follow the standard Python indentation rules, and the rest of the function remains unchanged.
