The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing a Python source code string that uses the 'async for' loop. This suggests that the problem may be related to handling asynchronous comprehension, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.7.

The potential error in the `generate_tokens` function lies in the handling of asynchronous comprehensions, particularly when the 'async for' part is encountered in the code.

The bug occurs because the existing `generate_tokens` function does not handle Python 3.7 features such as asynchronous comprehensions correctly. As a result, when the test function encounters Python 3.7 code, specifically the 'async for' syntax, it fails to parse it properly, leading to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the `generate_tokens` function needs to be updated to correctly handle Python 3.7 syntax, including 'async for' and other features introduced in this version.

Here's the corrected `generate_tokens` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # rest of the function stays the same

    if token in ('async', 'await'):
        yield (ASYNC if token == 'async' else AWAIT, token, spos, epos, line)
        continue
    elif token == 'def':
        if (stashed
                and stashed[0] == NAME
                and stashed[1] == 'async'):

            async_def = True
            async_def_indent = indents[-1]

            yield (ASYNC, stashed[1], stashed[2], stashed[3], stashed[4])
            stashed = None
```

This updated version of the `generate_tokens` function includes specific handling for the 'async' and 'await' keywords, ensuring that they are correctly tokenized when encountered in the source code string. This should address the issue identified in the test case and prevent the ValueError from occurring.
