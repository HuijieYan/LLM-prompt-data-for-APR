The potential error location within the generate_tokens function is not explicitly mentioned in the given code, but it seems that there might be syntax or logical errors within the while loop where the token generation is being performed.

The bug in the function may be occurring due to incorrect handling of the token generation logic, especially in cases where continued and multiline statements are encountered.

To fix the bug, the logic for token generation, especially for multiline and continued statements, should be carefully reviewed and revised. Additionally, the handling of specific token types such as INDENT, DEDENT, and NL should be checked for errors.

Corrected code:
```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    """
    The generate_tokens() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile).next    # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found. The line passed is the
    logical line; continuation lines are included.
    """
    # Your corrected code for the generate_tokens function goes here
    pass
