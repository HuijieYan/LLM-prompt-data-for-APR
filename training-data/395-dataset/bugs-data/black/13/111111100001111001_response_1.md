The potential error in the given function is a syntax error, likely due to an indentation issue. The "while 1:" loop is not indented properly, leading to a syntax error in Python.

To fix this issue, the "while 1:" loop needs to be indented properly. Additionally, the return statement at the end of the function should be a "return" statement instead of "yield" statement.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_13/blib2to3/pgen2/tokenize.py

# corrected function
def generate_tokens(readline):
    """
    The generate_tokens() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile).next    # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found. The line passed is the
    logical line; continuation lines are included.
