The potential error in the function is likely around the area where the `except` block is handling the `StopIteration` exception. When the `readline` function reaches the end of file and a `StopIteration` exception is raised, the `readline` function should return an empty string instead of the current behavior. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix this, we can modify the `except` block to return an empty string when a `StopIteration` exception is caught. Additionally, we can add an additional check to ensure that the `readline` function returns a string before proceeding with further operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_tokens` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    while True:  # loop over lines in stream
        line = readline()
        if not isinstance(line, str):  # Check if readline returns string
            line = ''
        lnum = lnum + 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)

        # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    if stashed:
        yield stashed
        stashed = None

    for indent in indents[1:]:  # pop remaining indent levels
        yield (DEDENT, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
    yield (ENDMARKER, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `readline` returns a string before proceeding with the further operations. This helps to handle the `StopIteration` exception more gracefully and prevents unexpected behavior.
