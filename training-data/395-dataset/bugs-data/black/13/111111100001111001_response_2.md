The potential error location within the problematic function is around the handling of `async_def` variable and the use of `stashed` token.

The bug occurs in the `generate_tokens` function because the logic for handling `async_def` and `stashed` tokens is causing unexpected behavior. The `stashed` variable is not being properly used to store tokens before yielding them, and the handling of the `async_def` condition is causing anomalies in the token generation process.

To fix the bug, we can modify the handling of the `async_def` condition and the usage of the `stashed` token variable as follows:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (previous code)

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum = lnum + 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)

        # Modify the handling of async_def and stashed tokens
        if async_def and async_def_nl and async_def_indent >= indents[-1]:
            async_def = False
            async_def_nl = False
            async_def_indent = 0

        # Replace the use of stashed token with a separate variable
        if stashed:
            token_to_yield = stashed
            stashed = None
            yield token_to_yield
        # ... (remaining code)
```

In the modified code, the handling of the `async_def` condition and `stashed` tokens is corrected to ensure proper token generation and yield. This should resolve the unexpected behavior and potential bugs in the `generate_tokens` function.
