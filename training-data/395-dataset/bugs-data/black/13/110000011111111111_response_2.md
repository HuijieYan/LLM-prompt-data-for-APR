The error message indicates that the code encountered an issue while parsing the source text "return (i * 2 async for i in arange(42))". This is likely due to a problem in the `generate_tokens()` function, which is used for parsing the source code.

The potential error location within the `generate_tokens()` function is likely in the logic that deals with the `async` and `await` tokens, as the error message specifically mentions "async for i".

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `generate_tokens()` function does not handle the `async for` expression properly, leading to a parsing error.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling async and await tokens should be adjusted to properly recognize the `async for` expression.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (existing code)

    while 1:
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''

        # ... (existing code)

        if initial.isidentifier():  # ordinary name
            if token in ('async', 'await'):
                if token == 'async':
                    stashed = (ASYNC, token, spos, epos, line)
                elif token == 'await':
                    stashed = (AWAIT, token, spos, epos, line)

        # ... (existing code)

    if stashed:
        yield stashed
    stashed = None

    for indent in indents[1:]:  # pop remaining indent levels
        yield (DEDENT, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
    yield (ENDMARKER, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
```

In the corrected code, the logic for checking `async` and `await` tokens has been improved to handle the `async for` expression properly, by stashing the tokens and yielding them accordingly. This should resolve the parsing issue related to the `async for` expression.
