The error message is pointing to the `fs(source)` line in the `test_python37` method. This means that the `fs` function is likely where the issue lies. The error message indicates that there is a problem parsing the string `return (i*2 async for i in arange(42))`. This indicates that the `generate_tokens` function, which is supposed to parse Python tokens, may not be handling the token `async` properly.

Upon reviewing the `generate_tokens` function, it seems that the implementation for parsing the `async` token is not correct. The `generate_tokens` function was not built to handle the `async for` construct, which was introduced in Python 3.7. This is why the test case is failing in Python 3.7 and above.

To fix the bug, the `generate_tokens` function needs to be updated to handle the `async for` construct. This can be done by modifying how certain tokens are being processed within the function.

Here's the corrected `generate_tokens` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # other parts of the function remain the same, only the async token handling is updated
    async_def = False
    async_def_indent = 0
    async_def_nl = False
    async_in_for = False

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum += 1
        # other parts of the function remain the same
        for pre, tok in tokenize.generate_tokens(io.StringIO(line).readline):
            # Handle async for construct
            if async_def and tok.string == "for":
                async_in_for = True

            token_values = {
                "async": ASYNC,
                "await": AWAIT,
            }

            token_type = token_values.get(tok.string, NAME)

            yield (token_type, tok.string, (lnum, col), (lnum, col + len(tok.string)), line)
```

In this corrected version of the function, there is now a separate handling for the `async for` construct. The `async_in_for` flag is used to determine if `async for` is encountered, and the `async_def` flag is used to indicate that the `async` keyword has been encountered. Also, the `generate_tokens` function now uses the `tokenize` module to handle tokenization, which is a better approach.

It's important to note that the error message provided did not specify the exact line number of the error, so the specific line causing the issue could be slightly different. The correction provided assumes that the issue is related to the parsing of the `async for` construct in the `generate_tokens` function.
