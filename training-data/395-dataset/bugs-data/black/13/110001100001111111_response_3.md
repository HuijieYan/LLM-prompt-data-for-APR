The potential error location within the problematic function is likely within the while loop that processes lines and tokens. 

The issue could be occurring due to a bug in handling the 'async for' statement. The current implementation does not handle this case properly and might be causing the parsing issue mentioned in the GitHub issue title.

To fix this bug, the implementation needs to be updated to properly handle the 'async for' statement and ensure that it is parsed correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # rest of the code remains unchanged as the fix is specific to handling 'async for' statement
    while 1:                                   # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
            # rest of the code remains the same
            if token == 'for':
                if async_def:
                    yield (ASYNC, token, spos, epos, line)
                else:
                    yield (NAME, token, spos, epos, line)
            else:
                if stashed:
                    yield stashed
                    stashed = None
                yield tok
                # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the 'async for' statement has been updated to ensure proper parsing and token generation.
