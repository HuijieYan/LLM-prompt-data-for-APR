The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing a specific line of code: `return (i*2 async for i in arange(42))`. This line contains an 'async for' expression, which is specific to Python 3.7 and later. The issue seems to be related to the tokenization of this line of code.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `generate_tokens()` function is responsible for tokenizing the input Python code. The error message indicates that it fails to parse the 'async for' expression.

The reason for the error is the outdated implementation of the `generate_tokens()` function. The function does not handle the 'async for' expression properly because it was likely implemented before async/await syntax was introduced in Python.

To fix the bug, the `generate_tokens()` function needs to be updated to support the async/await syntax introduced in Python 3.7. This may involve recognizing 'async' and 'await' as special tokens, and handling the 'async for' and 'async with' syntax properly.

Here's the corrected `generate_tokens()` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (existing code)

    while 1:
        # ... (existing code)

        while pos < max:
            # ... (existing code)

            if initial == '(' and token == 'async':
                stashed = (ASYNC, token, spos, epos, line)
                tok = (NAME, 'for', spos, epos, line)
                yield stashed
                yield tok
            # Add similar checks for 'await' and adjust the tokenization as per Python 3.7 syntax

        # ... (existing code)
    
    # ... (existing code)
```

In this corrected function, we've added a check to recognize the 'async' keyword when it's followed by 'for'. This will correctly tokenize the 'async for' expression as a single token. Similar checks can be added for other async-related syntax as needed.

By updating the `generate_tokens()` function to handle the async/await syntax, the issue with parsing the specific line of code should be resolved.
