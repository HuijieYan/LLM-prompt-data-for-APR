The bug is likely occurring in the `generate_tokens` function within the given Python file. The issue is not explicitly mentioned in the provided GitHub issue title and description, so it's unclear what the specific bug is.

Potential error location: The error could be occurring due to the tokenization process failing to handle the input `return (i * 2 async for i in arange(n))` correctly, possibly due to an issue with the async/await parsing logic in the function.

Reasons behind the bug: The `generate_tokens` function is a complex tokenization function that handles various types of tokens and their parsing. It's likely that the function is not correctly identifying and handling the async/await statement in the given test case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review and modify the async/await parsing logic in the `generate_tokens` function. Additionally, it may be necessary to ensure that the function correctly handles the specific input `return (i * 2 async for i in arange(n))` by adjusting the tokenization process for this type of input.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # your correction here
    pass
```

The corrected code is a placeholder and would need to be filled in with the actual corrected implementation based on a thorough analysis of the async/await parsing logic within the `generate_tokens` function.
