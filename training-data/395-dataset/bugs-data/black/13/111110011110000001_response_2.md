The error occurs during the parsing of the source text `src_txt` in the `lib2to3_parse()` function, which is being called by the `format_str()` method. The error message indicates a parsing issue at line 4, column 16 in the source text.

The potential error location within the `generate_tokens` function seems to be the handling of the `async_def` and `async_def_nl` variables. It appears that the use of these variables is causing the async/await construct to be misinterpreted, leading to the parsing issue in the `lib2to3_parse` function.

The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the `async` and `await` keywords within the `generate_tokens` function. These keywords are used for async/await parsing but are not being managed correctly. As a result, the parsing error occurs when the source text is being processed, causing the test case to fail.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to review the logic related to `async_def` and `async_def_nl`, ensuring that the async/await construct is correctly identified and handled. This may involve modifying the conditional statements and variable assignments that are responsible for managing the async/await parsing.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_tokens` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # Replace the buggy function with the corrected implementation

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    async_def = False
    async_def_indent = 0
    async_def_nl = False
    in_async_for = False  # Flag to track async for

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
            
        # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

        if token == 'async' and line[pos:pos + 4] == "for ":  # Async for
            in_async_for = True
            extra_token = line[pos:pos + 4]
            pos += 4
            yield (ASYNC, token, spos, (lnum, pos), line)
            yield (ERRORTOKEN, extra_token, spos, (lnum, pos - 4), line)
            token = "for"
            continue

        # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
```

In the corrected implementation, additional logic is introduced to properly handle the `async` and `await` keywords, as well as the async/await parsing logic. The `in_async_for` flag is used to track async for, and conditional statements are updated to handle async/await constructs correctly.
