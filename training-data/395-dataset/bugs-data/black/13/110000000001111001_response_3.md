The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be with the `try-except` block in the while loop where `readline()` is called. The function `readline()` is used to read lines from some input source, but the exception handling for `StopIteration` is not correctly implemented.

The bug occurs because the `try-except` block is only handling the `StopIteration` exception by assigning an empty string to `line` when `StopIteration` is raised. This is not an accurate way of handling the `StopIteration` exception, as it results in the incomplete or partial reading of the input.

To fix this issue, the handling of the `StopIteration` exception should be modified to properly account for the end of input.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # previous code from the buggy function remains the same

    while True:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            break
        # remaining code within the while loop remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the `try-except` block is modified to correctly handle the `StopIteration` exception by breaking out of the while loop when the end of the input source is reached. This ensures that the generator terminates upon reaching the end of the input.
