After analyzing the given code, it appears that the code has some errors. Here are the reasons for the bug and the potential fixes:

Error:
The provided code has numerous issues including indentation errors, syntax errors, and variable errors. Additionally, the use of tabs and spaces is inconsistent, and the comments are not properly aligned.

Potential Bug Location:
The code has multiple bug locations due to which it may be generating unexpected results. It is recommended to revise the entire code to ensure it is following best practices and adhering to the correct Python syntax rules.

Reasons for Bug:
The potential reasons for the bug include incorrect syntax, inconsistent use of tabs and spaces, and violation of Python naming conventions. Furthermore, the inappropriate handling of exceptions may lead to errors within the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and revise the entire code to ensure it adheres to the correct Python syntax and formatting guidelines.
2. Properly handle exceptions and errors within the function.
3. Ensure that the code follows Python naming conventions and uses consistent indentation with spaces instead of tabs.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    """
    The generate_tokens() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile).next    # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found. The line passed is the
    logical line; continuation lines are included.
