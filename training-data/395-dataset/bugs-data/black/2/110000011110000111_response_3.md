The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` method is called in the `test_fmtonoff4` test case. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `fs` function. This suggests that the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, which is called by the `fs` function, is producing incorrect output.

Upon analyzing the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, the bug seems to be related to the logic for checking and handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments within the `container.prefix`.

The issue is that the current implementation of the `generate_ignored_nodes` function does not correctly handle the behavior of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments when they cross block boundaries. Additionally, the logic for the checking of these comments might not be accurate, leading to unexpected return in certain cases.

To fix this issue, it is essential to modify the logic for handling `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments to accurately identify their scope and properly handle them when they cross block boundaries.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional, List
# Assuming LN and Leaf are imported or defined elsewhere

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    FMT_ON = {"# fmt: on"}  # Assuming FMT_ON and FMT_OFF are defined elsewhere
    FMT_OFF = {"# fmt: off"} 

    # Define a helper function to check if fmt is on or off
    def is_fmt_on_off(container: LN, index: int, fmt_set: set) -> bool:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in fmt_set:
                return comment.value == "# fmt: on"
        return False

    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)

    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        in_fmt_block = True
        parents: List[LN] = []

        while container and in_fmt_block:
            # Check if fmt is on or off in the current block
            is_fmt_on = is_fmt_on_off(container, -1, FMT_ON)
            if not is_fmt_on:
                is_fmt_on = is_fmt_on_off(container, -1, FMT_OFF)

            # Check if we need to exit the fmt block
            if is_fmt_on:
                in_fmt_block = False
                break

            # If not part of fmt block, yield the container
            yield container

            # Move to the next sibling
            container = container.next_sibling

            # Check if we need to exit the fmt block with parent containers
            while not container and parents:
                container = parents.pop().next_sibling
        
        if not in_fmt_block:
            # Move to the next sibling
            container = container.next_sibling

```

This corrected implementation of the `generate_ignored_nodes` function should address the issues related to the handling of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments when they cross block boundaries.
