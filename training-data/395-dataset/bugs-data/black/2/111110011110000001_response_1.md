The error message is an AssertionError indicating that the expected and actual outputs from the test case `test_fmtonoff4` are not matching. This implies that there is an issue with the function `generate_ignored_nodes`.

The potential error in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function lies in the `for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):` loop where the variable `is_fmt_on` is not updated correctly based on the `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` conditions. This means that the function is not correctly detecting the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments in the source code.

The bug is occurring because the `is_fmt_on` flag is being reset to `False` for each comment, irrespective of whether it should be set or reset based on the comments.

To fix the bug, you can update the `is_fmt_on` variable within the loop correctly based on the comments and then return the result after the for loop has finished iterating over all the comments. Additionally, you could remove the unnecessary use of `list_comments` and instead use built-in Python string functions to check for presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` directives.

The corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is as follows:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for line in container.prefix.split('\n'):
            if '# fmt: on' in line:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif '# fmt: off' in line:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

This corrected code uses the `split` method to iterate over each line of the container's prefix and then checks for the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` directives to update the `is_fmt_on` flag appropriately.
