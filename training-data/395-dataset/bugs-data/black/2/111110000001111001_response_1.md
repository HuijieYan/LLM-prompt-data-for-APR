The issue with the given `generate_ignored_nodes` function is that the `is_fmt_on` variable is not being updated correctly. The `is_fmt_on` variable is being set to `False` and never updated to `True` even if the comment value is in `FMT_ON` list. This is because the `is_fmt_on` variable is being reset to `False` on each iteration of the for loop.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `is_fmt_on` variable based on whether the comment value is in the `FMT_ON` list or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True  # update the is_fmt_on variable
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected code, the `is_fmt_on` variable is updated to `True` when the comment value is found in the `FMT_ON` list, allowing the function to correctly detect the `# fmt: on` comment and stop the iteration.
