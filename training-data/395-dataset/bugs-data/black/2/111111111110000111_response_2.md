Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, specifically with the iteration over `list_comments` and the is_fmt_on flag check.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `is_fmt_on` flag is being incorrectly handled within the while loop, and it causes premature return from the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `is_fmt_on` flag should be set to True upon encountering "# fmt: on" and it should only be set to False upon encountering "# fmt: off" or the end of the block. Additionally, the function should iterate over comments only until the end of the block.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator, List
from some_module import Leaf, LN, ProtoComment

FMT_ON = "# fmt: on"
FMT_OFF = "# fmt: off"

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value == FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value == FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
                break  # exit the loop when off comment is found
                
            if is_fmt_on:  # only check for fmt flag if is_fmt_on is True
                yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
