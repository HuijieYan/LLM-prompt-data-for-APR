The error is related to the function `generate_ignored_nodes` which is supposed to generate all the leaves until it encounters `# fmt: on`. The error message from the test function indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

Upon analyzing the `generate_ignored_nodes` function and the provided test case data, it seems that the function is not handling the boundary condition correctly. The logic for checking `is_fmt_on` status and returning from the function is incorrect. It also seems like the function isn't properly detecting the `# fmt: on` comment.

The bug is occurring because the function incorrectly returns when `is_fmt_on` is True, but it should continue iterating until it encounters `# fmt: on`. Additionally, the logic for checking the presence of `# fmt: on` is not functioning properly.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to iterate through all the containers until it encounters `# fmt: on`. It should only return when it finds the `# fmt: on` comment. Also, the logic to check for the presence of `# fmt: on` should be corrected.

Here is the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
# You may need to import the relevant classes and methods

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break
            
        if is_fmt_on:
            break
        
        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

With these changes, the function should now continue iterating until it finds `# fmt: on` and only return when the condition is met. This should resolve the issue highlighted in the test case.

Additionally, it would be helpful to have the definition of the `Leaf` and `LN` classes to provide a more accurate corrected output.
