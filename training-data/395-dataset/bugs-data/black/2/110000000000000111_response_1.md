The problem with the current function `generate_ignored_nodes` is that it is not properly checking for the `# fmt: on` directive across block boundaries and decorators. The function is intended to generate all leaves until it encounters `# fmt: on`, but it is not functioning as expected.

The issue seems to be related to the way the function is checking for the `# fmt: on` directive. It is currently only checking the prefix of the container, but it needs to take into account all the containers and decorators to accurately determine if the `# fmt: on` directive is present.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle block boundaries and decorators when checking for the `# fmt: on` directive.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    fmt_on_found = False
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                fmt_on_found = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                fmt_on_found = False
        if fmt_on_found:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, we use a `fmt_on_found` variable to keep track of whether the `# fmt: on` directive has been found. We continue yielding containers until we find the `# fmt: on` directive or reach the end of the block.

This should fix the issue related to `# fmt: on` not working when crossing block boundaries and decorators.
