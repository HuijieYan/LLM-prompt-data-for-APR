Potential Error:
The function `list_comments` is being called with an incorrect argument `is_endmarker`, which is causing the error.

Reason for the Bug:
The function `list_comments` is being called with an incorrect argument. The `list_comments` function signature shows that it takes only one argument `prefix`, but in the buggy function, it is being called with an additional argument `is_endmarker`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Remove the extra argument `is_endmarker` from the call to `list_comments` or provide the correct argument that matches the function signature.

Corrected Code:

```python
from typing import List, Iterator, Optional
from some_module import Leaf, LN, ProtoComment  # assuming these imports are necessary

FMT_ON = ["fmt_on"]  # Assuming these are the values for FMT_ON and FMT_OFF
FMT_OFF = ["fmt_off"]

def container_of(leaf: Leaf) -> LN:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def list_comments(prefix: str) -> List[ProtoComment]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return
    
        yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```
