The issue with the provided function is that it is not properly checking for the `# fmt: on` comment in the container's prefix and returning prematurely. The `is_fmt_on` flag is set inside the loop but not used to properly control the return of the function.

To fix this issue, we need to properly check for the presence of `# fmt: on` in the prefix comments and update the `is_fmt_on` flag accordingly. Then, we can use this flag to control whether the function should continue yielding containers or stop.

Additionally, the return type of the function should be changed to `Iterator[Node]` to match the yielded type.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Iterator

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[Node]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[Node] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

This corrected code properly checks for the presence of `# fmt: on`, updates the `is_fmt_on` flag, and uses it to control whether the function should continue yielding containers or stop.
