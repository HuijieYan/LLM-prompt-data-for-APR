The error message indicates a failure in the assertion of the expected and actual outputs of the test `test_fmtonoff4`. The error message shows a difference between the expected and actual outputs. It seems that the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments are not being processed properly.

The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is the logic that checks for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments and determines whether to continue iterating over the container nodes.

The bug occurs because in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, the check for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments is not implemented properly. The logic for processing these comments does not account for the cases when these comments are present within different blocks or decorators, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the `generate_ignored_nodes` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments that are present within different blocks or decorators.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Break the loop once # fmt: on is found
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, after finding the `# fmt: on` comment, the loop is broken to ensure that the correct behavior is maintained. This change addresses the issue where the `# fmt: on` comment was not being treated correctly across different blocks or decorators.
