The error message in the `test_fmtonoff4` function shows a failed assertion between the expected and actual output. It appears that there are issues with formatting related to comments and indentation.

The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` method is the loop that iterates through the comments obtained from the `list_comments` function. It looks for specific comments ('# fmt: on' and '# fmt: off') to determine whether the formatting is on or off.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the mishandling of comments and the logic for determining the formatting state within the loop.

One approach for fixing the bug is to correctly handle comments and the state of `is_fmt_on` within the loop. This might involve revising the logic for understanding when the formatting is on or off and ensuring that the correct nodes are yielded.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from black import Leaf, LN, list_comments, FMT_ON, FMT_OFF

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value == "# fmt: on":
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value == "# fmt: off":
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return
    
        yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected code:
- We loop through all comments using `list_comments` and explicitly check for "# fmt: on" and "# fmt: off".
- We use the correct comparison operator for checking the comment values.
- The function should now behave as intended, yielding the correct nodes until the formatting is turned on.
