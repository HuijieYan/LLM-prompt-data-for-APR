The bug occurs in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, which is supposed to start from the container of a leaf and generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`. However, the current implementation does not properly handle crossing block boundaries and decorators, as mentioned in the GitHub issue title and description.

The bug occurs because the `is_fmt_on` flag is never being updated when iterating through the comments. Additionally, the `return` statement inside the loop causes the function to exit prematurely.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_fmt_on` flag based on the comments and ensure that the loop iterates through all the comments to determine whether `# fmt: on` has been encountered. We also need to remove the `return` statement and instead continue iterating through the leaves until the end of the block is reached.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional, List
# Assume Leaf and LN are imported from other parts of the code
# Also, assume FMT_ON and FMT_OFF are defined somewhere in the code

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, we removed the unnecessary `(prefix, is_endmarker=False)` argument from the `list_comments` function, as it was not required. We also removed the `return` statement and fixed the logic for updating the `is_fmt_on` flag based on the comments. Now, the function iterates through all the comments for each container leaf and properly handles the `# fmt: on` condition.
