The test function `test_fmtonoff4` compares the expected output `expected` with the actual output `actual`. It fails with an assertion error indicating that the formatting of the code is not correct.

The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is the conditional statement:

```python
if is_fmt_on:
    return
```

The bug occurs because the `yield container` statement is not called when `is_fmt_on` is `True`, but the function should still continue to yield the container. This condition to return early is terminating the function prematurely.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to skip the `yield container` statement when `is_fmt_on` is `True` but still continue the loop to process the next container.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf, prefix: str) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            # Skip processing leaf and continue to the next container
            container = container.next_sibling
            continue

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code:
- The need for passing the `prefix` to `list_comments` function is added, assuming it is needed.
- The conditional `if is_fmt_on:` is replaced with `if is_fmt_on: continue` to skip processing and continue with the next container.
- The corrected function returns an iterator of LN objects that are not ignored by the `# fmt: on` statement.
