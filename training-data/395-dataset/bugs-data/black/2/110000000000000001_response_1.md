Potential error:
The potential error in the provided function is that the `is_fmt_on` variable is not being updated correctly inside the loop. The condition for `is_fmt_on` is being reset in each iteration of the loop, which may lead to incorrect results.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `is_fmt_on` variable is not being updated based on the actual comments found in the container's prefix. Instead, it is being reset to False in each iteration, leading to incorrect evaluation of the comments.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update the `is_fmt_on` variable based on the actual comments found in the container's prefix. We should iterate through the comments and update the `is_fmt_on` variable accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional, List

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        comments: List[str] = list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False)
        for comment in comments:
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, we have created a list `comments` to store all the comments in the container's prefix. Then, we iterate through the comments and update the `is_fmt_on` variable based on the comments found. If we encounter a comment that matches `FMT_ON`, we set `is_fmt_on` to True. If we encounter a comment that matches `FMT_OFF`, we set `is_fmt_on` to False. If `is_fmt_on` becomes True, we break out of the loop. This ensures that the `is_fmt_on` variable is updated correctly based on the comments in the container's prefix.
