1. The test case `test_fmtonoff4` is trying to compare the expected and actual outputs of the `fs` function, and it is failing with an AssertionError.

2. The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function could be the logic for checking if the comment is within `FMT_ON` or `FMT_OFF` and how the loop for `list_comments` is implemented.

3. The bug seems to be related to the logic within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, specifically in the way it handles the comments and the `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` flags. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying the `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` comments and not handling these appropriately before yielding the container.

4. To fix this bug, we should review the logic for checking if the comment is within `FMT_ON` or `FMT_OFF`, and also ensure that the `is_fmt_on` flag is appropriately utilized. Additionally, we should iterate through all comments for the container instead of returning after the first comment is processed.

5. Corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
import token
from black import Leaf, LN
from black.list_comments import list_comments
from black.type_completer import FMT_ON, FMT_OFF

def container_of(leaf: Leaf) -> Optional[LN]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            yield container
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
