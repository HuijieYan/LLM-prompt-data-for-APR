Potential error location: The if statement `if is_fmt_on:` is causing the function to return without yielding anything if `is_fmt_on` is True.

Reason for the bug: The function is designed to generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`, but the `is_fmt_on` variable is causing the function to stop prematurely when it should actually continue generating leaves.

Approaches to fixing the bug:
1. Instead of returning when `is_fmt_on` is True, use a break statement to exit the for loop and continue the while loop.
2. Use a flag variable to track whether the function should continue yielding leaves, rather than directly using the `is_fmt_on` variable.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if not is_fmt_on:  # Continue yielding leaves if is_fmt_on is False
            yield container
        else:
            break  # Exit the for loop and continue to the next leaf

        container = container.next_sibling
```
