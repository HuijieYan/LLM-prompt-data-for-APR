The bug in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function seems to be in the loop that checks for comments within the container's prefix. The loop does not correctly update the `is_fmt_on` variable. Additionally, the `list_comments` function call has an additional argument `is_endmarker=False` which is not part of the function definition.

The loop processes each comment in `container.prefix` and updates the `is_fmt_on` variable based on the comment value. However, the loop does not account for the possibility of multiple comments, and it should not return if `is_fmt_on` is True. Instead, it should continue to the next container until it finds a comment that sets `is_fmt_on` to True.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to process each comment and set `is_fmt_on` based on the last comment in the container's prefix.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False

        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected code, the loop has been updated to process each comment in `container.prefix` and set `is_fmt_on` based on the last comment in the container's prefix. Additionally, the unnecessary argument `is_endmarker` has been removed from the `list_comments` function call.
