The bug occurs in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, which is intended to generate all leaves until the `# fmt: on` block, stopping at the end of the block. However, the bug prevents the function from correctly handling the `# fmt: on` directive when it crosses block boundaries and decorators.

The issue arises from the `is_fmt_on` variable not being correctly updated based on the comment value. Additionally, the function prematurely returns when encountering the `# fmt: on` comment, which prevents it from continuing to yield container nodes until the end of the block.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate over all comments in the container's prefix, update the `is_fmt_on` variable based on the comment values, and return only after iterating through all comments and determining if the `# fmt: on` directive is present. Additionally, the function should continue yielding container nodes even after encountering the `# fmt: on` directive until the end of the block is reached.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator
from some_module import LN, Leaf, container_of, list_comments

FMT_ON = '# fmt: on'
FMT_OFF = '# fmt: off'

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False

        if is_fmt_on:
            yield container
            container = container.next_sibling  # yield the container and move to the next sibling
        else:
            container = container.next_sibling  # only move to the next sibling if not encountering the # fmt: on directive
```
This corrected code addresses the bug by correctly updating the `is_fmt_on` variable based on the comment values and ensuring that the function continues to yield container nodes until the end of the block, even after encountering the `# fmt: on` directive.
