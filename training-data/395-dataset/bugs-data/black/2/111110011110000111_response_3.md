The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with the formatting of the code. The differences identified in the formatting between the expected and actual outputs suggest that the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` commands are not being applied correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, where the `is_fmt_on` variable seems to be correctly identifying when the `# fmt: on` is present, but it is not being used to control the yield or return behavior, leading to unexpected formatting behavior.

The issue is occurring because the loop that checks for the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments is not properly controlling the yield of container nodes when `# fmt: off` is encountered, and the function is not handling the block boundaries efficiently.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly handle the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments to control the yield behavior of container nodes. Additionally, updating the logic to handle block boundaries more efficiently would help to resolve the issue.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator
from some_module import LN, Leaf, list_comments, FMT_ON, FMT_OFF

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            yield container
        else:
            return

        container = container.next_sibling
```
In this corrected code, the `is_fmt_on` variable is used to control the yield behavior of container nodes based on the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. This updated logic should help in resolving the formatting issues.
