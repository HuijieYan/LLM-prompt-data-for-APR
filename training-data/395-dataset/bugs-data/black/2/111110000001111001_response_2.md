The issue with the provided function `generate_ignored_nodes` is that it does not handle the case when the loop terminates without encountering the `# fmt: on`. The `is_fmt_on` variable is not properly updated within the loop. Additionally, the function should return `None` instead of using `yield` when the condition is met.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic inside the `while` loop to properly handle the case when `# fmt: on` is not encountered within the block.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from libcst import Leaf, Node, LN  # Import the necessary data types

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
             return  # Exit the function if # fmt: on is encountered

        yield container

        if container.next_sibling is not None:
            container = container.next_sibling
        else:
            container = None  # Set container to None to exit the loop.

    return  # Return None when the loop terminates without encountering # fmt: on
```

In this updated code, the `container.next_sibling` is checked for `None` before updating the `container` variable, and the function returns `None` outside the loop when `# fmt: on` is not encountered.
