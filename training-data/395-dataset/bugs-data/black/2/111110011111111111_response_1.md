The error occurs because the original function `generate_ignored_nodes` is not properly handling the `# fmt: on` directive. The function is supposed to start from the container of the given leaf node and generate all leaves until encountering `# fmt: on`. However, the logic inside the function is not correctly identifying the `# fmt: on` directive and stopping the generation process.

The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the `# fmt: on` directive and the associated comments while iterating through the nodes. The code logic does not appropriately identify when the `# fmt: on` directive is encountered.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code logic to correctly identify and handle the `# fmt: on` directive and ensure that the loop stops when encountering it.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from tokenize import ENDMARKER
from ast import AST

FMT_ON = {'# fmt: on'}

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: AST) -> Iterator[AST]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    def container_of(leaf: AST) -> Optional[AST]:
        # Implementation of container_of function is required
        pass

    container: Optional[AST] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Exit the loop when # fmt: on is encountered

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code:
- The function accepts an `AST` type for the `leaf` parameter, as the original `Leaf` type might be specific to a particular library or framework.
- `ENDMARKER` is used to represent the end of the block.
- A placeholder `container_of` function is used to get the container of the leaf, and it should be implemented based on the specific requirements and container structure.
- The loop stops when encountering the `# fmt: on` directive by using `break` to exit the loop.

The corrected code addresses the identified issues and should improve the functionality of the `generate_ignored_nodes` function.
