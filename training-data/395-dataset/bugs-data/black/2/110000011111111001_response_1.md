The error message from the test function indicates that the 'assertFormatEqual' method is failing. The expected and actual formatted strings are not equal, which creates the discrepancy.

The issue might be in the 'generate_ignored_nodes' function, especially in the handling of '# fmt: off'. The function seems to be prematurely stopping whenever it encounters '# fmt: on', which could be incorrect behavior.

The incorrect behavior is due to the premature return when encountering '# fmt: on' and not properly processing the subsequent nodes.

To fix the bug, the function should continue processing nodes even after encountering '# fmt: on'. It should only stop when it encounters `# fmt: off`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False

        yield container

        if is_fmt_on:
            container = container.next_sibling
        else:
            break
```

In this corrected implementation, the 'yield container' is called before checking the condition for 'is_fmt_on'. This ensures that all nodes are processed and yielded in case '# fmt: on' is encountered. The function only stops at encountering `# fmt: off`.
