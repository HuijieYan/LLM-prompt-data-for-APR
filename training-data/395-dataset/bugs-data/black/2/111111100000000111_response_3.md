The error seems to be occurring because the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is not handling the `# fmt: on` correctly, specifically when crossing block boundaries and dealing with decorators.

The potential error location in the code is:
```python
if is_fmt_on:
    return
```

The reason for the bug is that the code is returning and stopping the iteration when encountering `# fmt: on`, which is incorrect behavior. Instead, it should continue parsing until the end of the block or the end of the decorators.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to continue parsing when encountering `# fmt: on` instead of returning immediately.

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional, List

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

Note: This is based on the assumption that `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` are defined somewhere in the code. If not, they need to be defined appropriately for the function to work correctly.
