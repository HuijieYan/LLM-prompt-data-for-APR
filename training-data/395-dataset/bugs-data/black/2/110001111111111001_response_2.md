The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs. The `assertFormatEqual` method compares the expected and actual outputs, and the assertion fails due to a mismatch in the formatted code.

The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is likely the logic inside the while loop that checks for `is_fmt_on`. It seems that the function is not properly iterating through the comments and setting the `is_fmt_on` flag accordingly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the comments and determining whether the `is_fmt_on` flag should be set.

To fix the bug, the function needs to iterate through the comments for the `container` and properly set the `is_fmt_on` flag based on the presence of `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
# Import other required modules and types

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return
        yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```

Please note that the code snippet lacks details on the `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` variables and their relevant types, so these would need to be properly defined in the function.
