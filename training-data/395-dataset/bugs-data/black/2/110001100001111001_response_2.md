The function `generate_ignored_nodes` has several issues. The main issue is that it always returns after the first iteration of the while loop, and it does not correctly identify when to stop yielding nodes.

To fix this function, we need to update the logic inside the while loop and properly handle the conditions for stopping the generation of ignored nodes.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Iterator
from node import Leaf, Node

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[Node]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[Node] = container_of(leaf)
    FMT_ON = '# fmt: on'
    FMT_OFF = '# fmt: off'
    
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):  # May need to adjust function signature
            if comment.value == FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value == FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code:
- We have added the `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` comments as local variables, since they were not defined previously.
- We replaced the condition `if comment.value in FMT_ON` with `if comment.value == FMT_ON` to check for exact matches, rather than substring matches.
- We have changed the `for` loop over comments to only use `list_comments(container.prefix)`, as the `is_endmarker` parameter is not needed and was causing an error.
- We have replaced the `return` statement with a `break` statement to exit the while loop when `is_fmt_on` is `True`.
- We have updated the return type to `Iterator[Node]` to match the `yield` statement.

This corrected function should properly yield the ignored nodes until `# fmt: on`, as required.
