The issue seems to be related to the `generate_ignored_nodes` function not handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments correctly when crossing block boundaries and decorators.

The potential error location within the function is the loop that checks for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments within the container prefix.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle crossing block boundaries and decorators, causing the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments to not take effect as expected.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to adjust the logic for handling `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments so that it correctly respects block boundaries and decorators.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from some_module import Leaf, LN, token  # Assuming these imports are needed
from some_other_module import list_comments  # Assuming this function is needed
from some_other_module import container_of  # Assuming this function is needed

FMT_ON = ["# fmt: on"]
FMT_OFF = ["# fmt: off"]

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    inside_decorator = False  # Flag to track if inside a decorator block
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        if container.type == token.NEWLINE and container.next_sibling:
            if container.next_sibling.prefix and "@" in container.next_sibling.prefix:
                inside_decorator = True  # Set flag if inside a decorator block
            else:
                inside_decorator = False  # Reset flag if not inside a decorator block

        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if not inside_decorator:  # Skip processing fmt comments if inside a decorator block
                if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                    is_fmt_on = True
                elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                    is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the presence of decorators and skip processing `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments if inside a decorator block. This should make the function correctly handle crossing block boundaries and decorators.
