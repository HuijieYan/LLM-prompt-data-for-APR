The error occurs in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. The function is meant to generate all nodes until it encounters `# fmt: on` within a specific container. However, the issue seems related to the incorrect handling of the `is_fmt_on` flag and the comments list. The variable `is_fmt_on` is being reset in each iteration, resulting in incorrect behavior when checking for `# fmt: on` comments.

The cause of the bug is that the `is_fmt_on` flag is reset to `False` in each iteration of the loop. This causes premature termination of the function, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the loop to properly handle the `is_fmt_on` flag and iteration of comments. Specifically, we should not reset the `is_fmt_on` flag to `False` in each iteration, instead we should set it to `True` when encountering `# fmt: on` comments. 

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False  # Initialize is_fmt_on to False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True  # Set is_fmt_on to True when encountering # fmt: on
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:  # Check if is_fmt_on is True
            return
        yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```

With this correction, the `is_fmt_on` flag is properly handled, ensuring that the function generates all nodes until encountering `# fmt: on` as intended. This should resolve the issue with the failing test case as well.
