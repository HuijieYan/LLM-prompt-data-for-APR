The potential error in the code is that the `list_comments` function is called with an extra parameter `is_endmarker`, which is not defined in the function signature.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `list_comments` function is being called with an extra, non-existent parameter `is_endmarker`, which is causing a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the extra parameter `is_endmarker` should be removed from the `list_comments` function call in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Generator, Optional, List

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Generator[LN, None, None]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return
    
        yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```
