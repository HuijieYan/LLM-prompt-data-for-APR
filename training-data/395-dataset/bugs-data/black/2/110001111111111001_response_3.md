The error occurs in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. The function appears to iterate through the container of the input `leaf` and checks for comments. If a comment with the value `'# fmt: on'` is found, the function returns, otherwise, it yields the container and proceeds to the next sibling.

The error message suggests that the formatting is incorrect, implying that the function is not stopping at the intended point specified by `'# fmt: on'` comment.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `is_fmt_on` variable and the return statement within the `while` loop. It's likely that the function is not correctly identifying when to stop iterating and when to yield a value.

To fix this bug, the condition for `if is_fmt_on:` should be modified to break the loop instead of returning immediately. Additionally, the `is_fmt_on` variable should be updated to `True` when the comment `'# fmt: on'` is found.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value == '# fmt: on':  # Check for specific comment value
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Break the loop if this comment is found
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Break the loop if formatting is on
        yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```
