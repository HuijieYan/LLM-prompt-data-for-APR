Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the function `generate_ignored_nodes` as it is not correctly handling the logic for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `generate_ignored_nodes` function is incorrectly handling the logic for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off`. It is not properly checking for the `# fmt: on` condition and returning prematurely, causing the formatting to not take effect until the end of the block.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The function should iterate through the nodes and check for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments properly, ensuring that the formatting state is correctly handled and the function does not return prematurely.
2. Utilize a flag to track the formatting state and update it based on the comments encountered in the node's prefix.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from libcst._nodes._base import CSTNode

FMT_ON = ["# fmt: on"]  # Assuming FMT_ON and FMT_OFF are defined somewhere else
FMT_OFF = ["# fmt: off"]

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: CSTNode) -> Iterator[CSTNode]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[CSTNode] = container_of(leaf)
    is_fmt_on = True
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```
