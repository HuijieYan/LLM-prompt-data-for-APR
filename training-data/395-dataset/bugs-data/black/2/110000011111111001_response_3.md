The test case `test_fmtonoff4` fails with an `AssertionError` when comparing the expected and actual output of the `fs` function.

The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual values. It highlights the differences in formatting, including indentation and line breaks.

Upon analyzing the buggy function `generate_ignored_nodes`, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the comments with the strings `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on`. These strings are meant to control the formatting behavior within the block.

The issue occurs because the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is not correctly identifying the `# fmt: on` comment and updating the `is_fmt_on` flag accordingly. This results in improper termination of the loop.

To fix this bug, the logic to identify the `# fmt: on` comment and update the `is_fmt_on` flag needs to be corrected. Additionally, the function should continue generating nodes until the end of the block is encountered.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
# Assuming Leaf and LN are imported from some external module

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    is_fmt_on = False  # Initialize is_fmt_on flag outside the loop
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if not is_fmt_on:  # Continue generating nodes if is_fmt_on is False
            yield container
        else:
            # If is_fmt_on is True, break the loop and stop generating nodes
            break
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected code, the `is_fmt_on` flag is initialized outside the loop and is updated based on the comment values. The function will continue generating nodes until `# fmt: on` is encountered, at which point it will stop. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
