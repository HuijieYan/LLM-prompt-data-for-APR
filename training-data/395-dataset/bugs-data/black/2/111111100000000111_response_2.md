The bug seems to be related to the `generate_ignored_nodes` function not properly handling the `# fmt: on` directive when crossing block boundaries and decorators.

The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is the loop that checks for `# fmt: on` and returns early if found. The issue seems to be that the loop only checks the current container for the presence of `# fmt: on`, and does not properly handle the case where the `# fmt: on` directive is inside a different block or decorator.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly traverse up the AST to find the closest `# fmt: on` directive. As a result, the function incorrectly terminates early when encountering a `# fmt: on` comment inside a different block or decorator.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `generate_ignored_nodes` function to properly handle the traversal of the AST to find the closest `# fmt: on` directive, regardless of block boundaries or decorators.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from black import Leaf, LN, token, FMT_OFF, FMT_ON

# adjusted function signature
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    def is_fmt_on(container: LN) -> bool:
        for comment in container.prefix_comments:
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                return True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                return False
        return False

    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        if is_fmt_on(container):
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the `is_fmt_on` function checks the prefix comments of a given container and returns `True` if `# fmt: on` is found, or `False` if `# fmt: off` is found. This approach ensures that the function traverses up the AST to find the closest `# fmt: on` directive regardless of block boundaries or decorators.
