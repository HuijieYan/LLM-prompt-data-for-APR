The error message refers to an assertion failure in the `test_fmtonoff4` function, specifically related to the formatting of the source code. This suggests that there is an issue with the formatting of the source code, potentially due to the mishandling of the `# fmt: on` command. 

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the problematic function is `generate_ignored_nodes` which is designed to generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`, stopping at the end of the block. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `# fmt: on` command when crossing block boundaries and decorators in the source code. 

The problem with the current implementation is that the `is_fmt_on` flag is checked within the for loop iterating over comments, which may overwrite the value of `is_fmt_on` incorrectly. This leads to premature return and incorrect handling of the `# fmt: on` command.

To fix the bug, the `is_fmt_on` flag should be calculated based on the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments in the whole comment list, instead of checking it inside the for loop. Additionally, comments should be filtered based on the specific prefixes.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Iterator
from token import ENDMARKER

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != ENDMARKER:
        container_comments = list_comments(container.prefix)
        is_fmt_on = any(comment.value in ["# fmt: on", "# fmt: off"] for comment in container_comments)
        if is_fmt_on:
            return
    
        yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```

This updated code ensures that the `is_fmt_on` flag is correctly calculated based on the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments across the entire comment list. It also improves the iteration over comments to accurately filter based on prefixes. These changes address the reported bug related to the mishandling of the `# fmt: on` command when crossing block boundaries and decorators.
