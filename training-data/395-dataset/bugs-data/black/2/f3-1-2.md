The issue description is:

```text
Operating system: Linux Mint 19.0
Python version: 3.6.6
Black version: 18.9b0
Does also happen on master: yes

Simplest reproducer: the following is left unchanged. In fact, it behaves as if # fmt: off is true until end of file.

# fmt: off
if (x and y):
# fmt: on
    pass

if (x and y):
    pass
The soonest # fmt: on takes effect is at end of the indented if block.

Ran into this with a series of decorators:

# fmt: off
@click.command()
@click.option("-a", "--align",      help="aligned help texts")
@click.option("-b", "--big-option", help="should stay aligned")
# fmt: on
def foo(align,    big_option):
    pass
Simple workaround for me is keep the formatter commands within a "block" - the following works perfectly fine:

@click.command()
# fmt: off
@click.option("-a", "--align",      help="aligned help texts")
@click.option("-b", "--big-option", help="should stay aligned")
# fmt: on
def foo(align, big_option):
    pass
```
