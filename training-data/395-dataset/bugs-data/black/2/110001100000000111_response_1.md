The issue is with the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. This function is intended to start from the container of `leaf` and generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`, stopping at the end of the block. However, the function is not functioning as intended and the `# fmt: on` is not taking effect until the end of the block.

The potential error location within the function is the loop that checks for `# fmt: on` comments in the `list_comments` function.

The reason behind this bug is that the function does not properly handle the `# fmt: on` comment within the loop. It does not correctly detect the `# fmt: on` comment and therefore does not stop at the correct point.

To fix this bug, we can modify the loop to properly handle the detection of the `# fmt: on` comment and stop the generation of leaves at that point.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from black import Leaf, LN

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value == "# fmt: on":
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Exit the loop when # fmt: on is found
            elif comment.value == "# fmt: off":
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Exit the while loop when # fmt: on is found
    
        yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the loop is modified to properly handle the detection of `# fmt: on` and stop the generation of leaves when it is encountered. Additionally, the `list_comments` function is called without the `is_endmarker` argument, as it was not used in the provided code.
