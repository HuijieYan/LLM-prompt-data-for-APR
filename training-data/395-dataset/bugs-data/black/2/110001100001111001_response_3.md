The buggy function `generate_ignored_nodes` is intended to generate all leaves starting from the container of a given `Leaf` until a specific condition is met. The issue seems to be with how the function is intended to stop - currently, it's returning from the function prematurely instead of yielding the expected result.

The potential error location is likely in the conditional statement `if is_fmt_on: return`, as this will cause the function to end early.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `generate_ignored_nodes` is not properly iterating through the elements and is returning from the function instead of yielding the correct result.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the `if is_fmt_on: return` statement and replace it with a conditional `if not is_fmt_on:` to correctly handle the loop and yield the expected result.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
