Potential error location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. Specifically, the issue seems to be with the logic associated with handling the `# fmt: on` comments and returning the results.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
From the error message, it appears that the handling of the `# fmt: on` comments and the logic to stop at the end of the block are not functioning as expected. The function is not correctly identifying the `# fmt: on` comment and returning the results accordingly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for identifying `# fmt: on` comments and ensure that the function stops at the end of the block.
2. Verify the conditionals and loops for correctly handling the comments and iterating through the leaves until the expected conditions are met.

Corrected code:
```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator, List
from some_module import Leaf, LN, ProtoComment

def container_of(leaf: Leaf) -> LN:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def list_comments(prefix: str, is_endmarker: bool) -> List[ProtoComment]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value == '# fmt: on':  # Updated to check for exact match
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value == '# fmt: off':  # Added conditional for off case
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Break the loop when fmt_on is True

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
In the corrected code:
- The condition to check for the exact `# fmt: on` comment has been updated to match the exact value.
- An additional conditional has been added to handle the case when the comment is `# fmt: off`.
- The missing `break` statement has been added to exit the loop when `# fmt: on` is encountered.
