The bug in the code is that the function `generate_ignored_nodes` is returning early without yielding all the required values. This is happening because the `is_fmt_on` flag is not being updated correctly inside the `while` loop. 

The function should return only if `container` is None or if `container.type` is `token.ENDMARKER`. Otherwise, it should yield the container and update its value to the next sibling. Additionally, the `is_fmt_on` flag should be updated correctly by checking the prefix comment and its value.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_fmt_on` logic along with the condition for returning from the function. We also need to make sure that the correct value is being yielded inside the `while` loop.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator
from some_module import Leaf, LN, ProtoComment, List
import token

FMT_ON = ["# fmt: on"]
FMT_OFF = ["# fmt: off"]

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected code, the `is_fmt_on` flag is updated correctly by checking the values of the comments. Also, the condition for yielding the container and updating it to the next sibling is improved. Now the function will yield the correct values and return at the appropriate time.
