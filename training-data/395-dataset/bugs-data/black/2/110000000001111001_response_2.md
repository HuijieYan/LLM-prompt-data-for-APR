The issue with the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is that it is not updating the `is_fmt_on` variable correctly. Additionally, the function is using an incorrect return statement to exit the loop, which is not the intended behavior.

The potential error location is within the for loop that iterates through the comments. The `is_fmt_on` variable is being updated incorrectly, and the return statement inside the loop is causing premature termination of the function.

The bug occurs because the `is_fmt_on` variable is being updated within the for loop without considering the states of different comments. Additionally, the `return` statement inside the loop is terminating the function prematurely.

To fix the bug, the `is_fmt_on` variable should be updated based on the presence of specific comments, and the function should continue processing comments until the `# fmt: on` comment is encountered before stopping the generation of ignored nodes.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False

        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Stop processing comments and exit the loop

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
