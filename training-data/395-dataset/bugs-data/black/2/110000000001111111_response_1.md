The bug is related to the incorrect behavior of the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, specifically in handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. Based on the provided information, it seems that the function fails to properly recognize the `# fmt: on` comments and continue generating nodes even after encountering this comment.

It looks like the issue arises from the fact that the function is not correctly checking for the `# fmt: on` comment and stopping the generation of nodes accordingly. This results in the incorrect behavior described in the GitHub issue. 

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the `# fmt: on` comment and stop generating nodes when encountering this comment. This may require updating the logic in the loop that checks for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. Additionally, there may be a need to revise the logic for checking container types and prefixes to ensure the correct behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)

    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Add a break to stop checking comments after finding # fmt: on
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
                break  # Add a break to stop checking comments after finding # fmt: off

        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Stop generating nodes if # fmt: on is found

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, we added `break` statements to stop checking comments after finding the `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` comments. Additionally, we added a condition to break the loop and stop generating the nodes if the `# fmt: on` comment is found. These changes should fix the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
