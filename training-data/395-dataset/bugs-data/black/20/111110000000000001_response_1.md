Potential Error Location:
The potential error is at the parameter `write_back` as it is being compared to `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`, but these values are not defined anywhere in the code.

Reason for the Bug:
The error occurs because `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` are not defined, so the comparison is invalid.

Possible Approaches:
1. Define `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` as constants or enums.
2. Use boolean values `True` and `False` for the `write_back` parameter instead of `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`.

Corrected Code:

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import Any, Path
import sys
import multiprocessing
from difflib import ndiff
import tokenize
from tokenize import open as open_file
from tokenize import TokenInfo, TokenError

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.
