The error occurs when comparing the expected diff with the actual diff in the test case. The expected diff contains the placeholder "<stdin>", which is not consistent with the actual diff output. This inconsistency indicates that the function format_file_in_place is not providing the correct file path in the diff output.

The potential error location is in the format_file_in_place function, where the diff is generated and the file paths are included in the output.

The reason behind the bug is that the file path used in generating the diff output is not correctly specified or included in the output.

To fix the bug, the file path needs to be accurately included in the diff output to ensure consistency with the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the format_file_in_place function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
import tokenize
import os
from io import StringIO
from typing import Any

# assuming WriteBack is an Enum with values: NO, YES, DIFF
class WriteBack:
    NO = "NO"
    YES = "YES"
    DIFF = "DIFF"

# define NothingChanged exception if not already defined
class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass

# Assuming FileContent is a custom type for file content
FileContent = str

def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool) -> FileContent:
    # ... omitted code ...

def diff(a: str, b: str, a_name: str, b_name: str) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the function now includes the file paths in the diff output, ensuring that the output is consistent with expectations and allowing for a proper comparison to be made in the test case.
