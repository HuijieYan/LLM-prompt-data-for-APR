The error message indicates a comparison failure between the expected and actual diff output. The diff output contains file paths that do not match the expected file paths, causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the handling of file paths in the `format_file_in_place` function. It seems that the file paths are being manipulated incorrectly, leading to incorrect output in the diff.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the file paths are not being handled properly when creating the diffs, resulting in mismatched file paths in the output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the file paths to ensure that the correct file paths are included in the diff output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys
import os

# Corrected format_file_in_place function
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the file paths are properly handled when creating the diff, ensuring that the correct file paths are included in the output. This should address the issue with file paths not displaying correctly in the diff output.
