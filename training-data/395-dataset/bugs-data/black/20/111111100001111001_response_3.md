The bug occurs because the original implementation of the `format_file_in_place` function contains a few errors. First, the WriteBack Enum is not imported, and second, the `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` are not correctly defined. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the code as follows:

```python
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
import sys

WriteBack = Enum('WriteBack', 'NO YES DIFF')

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with open(src, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast)
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, we imported the `Enum` class from the `enum` module. We defined the `WriteBack` Enum using the `Enum` class. We used the right Enum values to compare with the `write_back` parameter and made sure to handle the 'YES' and 'DIFF' cases appropriately. Additionally, we replaced `tokenize.open(src)` with `open(src, 'r', encoding='utf-8')` which is a more conventional way of reading files.

The updated code should fix the bug and provide the expected output.
