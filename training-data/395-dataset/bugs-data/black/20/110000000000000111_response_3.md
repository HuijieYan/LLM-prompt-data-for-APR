The issue reported on GitHub is related to the `format_file_in_place` function not displaying the full file path in the `--diff` output. The issue seems to be in the part of the code where it constructs the original and formatted file names for diffing and where it writes the diff contents to the stdout.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `format_file_in_place` function where the `src_name` and `dst_name` are being constructed for displaying the original and formatted file names, and where the diff contents are being written to the stdout.

The bug occurs because the `src_name` and `dst_name` are being constructed using only the file name (`src.name`) without including the full path to the file. This results in the diff output not showing the full path to each file being formatted. Additionally, the diff contents are being written to stdout without including the full path.

To fix the bug, the `src_name` and `dst_name` should include the full path to the file, and the diff contents should display the full file path.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
from difflib import unified_diff
import tokenize
from tokenize import tokenize

class WriteBack:
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass

def format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length, fast):
    # Assume this function exists
    pass

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = str(src) + "  (original)"
        dst_name = str(src) + "  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = unified_diff(src_contents.splitlines(True), dst_contents.splitlines(True), src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.writelines(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `src_name` and `dst_name` are constructed using the full path to the file (`str(src)`) and the diff contents are written to stdout with the full file path included.
