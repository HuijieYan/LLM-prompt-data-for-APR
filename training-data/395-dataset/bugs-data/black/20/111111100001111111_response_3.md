The bug occurs in the way the file paths are being handled in the function `format_file_in_place` when the `write_back` option is set to `DIFF`.

The function is not correctly handling the file path names, and the bug is preventing the correct file paths from being displayed in the diff output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct file paths are being used in the diff output. We can use the `src.name` attribute to get the file name and append it to the original path to create the full file path. 

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
from typing import Any
from enum import Enum
import tokenize

class WriteBack(Enum):
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2
    NO = 0

class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass

# corrected format_file_in_place function
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected function, I replaced `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` with `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF` respectively to match the defined Enum values. I also used `src.name` to get the file name and create the full file paths for `src_name` and `dst_name` to ensure that the correct file paths are used in the diff output.
