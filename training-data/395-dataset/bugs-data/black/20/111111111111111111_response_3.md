The bug in the `format_file_in_place` function is causing the test `test_expression_diff` to fail. The error message indicates that the diff output is not displaying the full file path as expected.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location is identified in the section where the original and formatted file names are constructed and used in the diff output:

```python
src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `src.name` is being used to construct the names for the diff output, resulting in the display of only the filenames without the full path.

To fix this bug, the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function should construct the original and formatted file names using the full path of the source file (`src`), ensuring that the diff output displays the full file path.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"  # Use full path
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"  # Use full path
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

With this corrected code, the test `test_expression_diff` should pass without any assertion errors, and the diff output will display the full file path as expected.
