The error is occurring in the `test_expression_diff` test function. The test is failing when comparing the expected and actual diff output. This error is identified within the `format_file_in_place` function. The potential error location might be in the `diff` function, or how the `format_file_in_place` function is handling the diff comparisons.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect diff generation in the `diff` function or how the diff result is being handled in the `format_file_in_place` function.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the diff generation in the `diff` function and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior of the diff comparison in the `format_file_in_place` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with open(src, "r", encoding="utf-8") as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

This fixed function handles the reading of the source file correctly and writes the reformatted code back to the file or generates the diff based on the `write_back` parameter. It also utilizes the correct encoding while reading and writing to the file.
