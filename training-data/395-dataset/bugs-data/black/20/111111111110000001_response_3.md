The error message indicates that the expected and actual diff outputs are not equal. This suggests that the bug might be related to the diff output from the `format_file_in_place` function in the `black.py` file.

The potential error location within the `format_file_in_place` function is the section responsible for generating the diff content. The `diff` function is used to compare the original contents with the formatted contents. The issue seems to be related to how this comparison is being generated.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the `diff` function not generating the expected diff output for the given inputs.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review and possibly modify the implementation of the `diff` function. Another approach could be to review the usage of the `diff` function within the `format_file_in_place` function to ensure that it is being used correctly and that the comparison is yielding the expected diff output.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
import black
from black import WriteBack

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`black.format_file_contents`.
    """

    src_contents = src.read_text()
    try:
        dst_contents = black.format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except black.NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = black.diff_contents(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            print(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()

    return True
```
