Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the output of the `diff` function, where the file path is not being displayed in the format expected by the user.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `diff` function is not properly displaying the full file path in the --diff output, which makes it hard to read several concatenated diffs, especially when filenames are duplicated in different directories.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The `diff` function needs to be modified to properly display the full file path in the --diff output. Additionally, the `format_file_in_place` function may need to be adjusted accordingly to ensure that the file path is correctly passed to the `diff` function.

Corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
