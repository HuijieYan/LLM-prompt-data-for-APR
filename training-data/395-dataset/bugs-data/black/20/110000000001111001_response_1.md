The function seems to have an issue with the comparison of the write_back parameter. The function is comparing the enum values directly, which might not be the correct approach.

To fix this issue, we can use the value of the enum to compare it with the write_back parameter.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In this corrected code, I used `write_back == WriteBack.YES` and `write_back == WriteBack.DIFF` to compare the enum values, ensuring the correct comparison and handling of the `write_back` parameter.
