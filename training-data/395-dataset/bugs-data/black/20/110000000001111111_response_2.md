The bug here seems to be related to the construction of the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables. For example, the original code uses `src.name` directly, which only includes the file name without the full path. This leads to the issue described in the GitHub report where the --diff output doesn't display the full file path.

To fix this bug, we need to construct the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables using the full file path. We can achieve this by using `str(src)` to get the full path.

Additionally, it seems that the function is using a custom `WriteBack` enum, and the comparison in the `if` statement is referring to the `write_back` parameter but should refer to the enum directly. This should be fixed as well.

Finally, there is an incorrect check for `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`. These enum values are accessed as `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF`, not `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
import sys
from enum import Enum

class WriteBack(Enum):
   NO = 0
   YES = 1
   DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{str(src)}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{str(src)}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly construct the full file paths for `src_name` and `dst_name`, and use the `WriteBack` enum directly for comparisons. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
