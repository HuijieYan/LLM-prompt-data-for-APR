The error occurs in the test function for the `format_file_in_place` method. It seems that the output of the method is different from the expected output. The test case compares the expected output with the actual output and raises an AssertionError.

Upon analyzing the problematic `format_file_in_place` method and the provided error message, it appears that the `format_file_in_place` function is not returning the expected diff content. The diff content should match the expected diff but it has slight differences. This is likely because the method is not generating the diff content correctly.

To fix this issue, the `format_file_in_place` method should generate the diff content accurately based on the input parameters and file contents. It appears that the diff is being incorrectly calculated, leading to inconsistencies between expected and actual outputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` method:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
        
        try:
            dst_contents = format_file_contents(
                src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
            )
        except NothingChanged:
            return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:  # Replace write_back.YES with WriteBack.YES
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as file:
            file.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:  # Replace write_back.DIFF with WriteBack.DIFF
        diff_contents = generate_diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src.name, src.name)  # Generate the diff content
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
In this corrected version, the incorrect variable naming, such as `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`, has been fixed to use the Enum option `WriteBack`. Additionally, the calculation of the `diff_contents` based on `src_contents` and `dst_contents` should be accurate.

This series of fixes should address the bug and ensure that the `format_file_in_place` method accurately generates the expected diff.
