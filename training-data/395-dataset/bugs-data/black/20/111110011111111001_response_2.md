The potential error location within the function is the comparison check for `write_back` in the following section:
```
if write_back == write_back.YES:
```
and 
```
elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
```

The issue seems to be related to comparing the `write_back` enum instance directly with its values, instead of checking the value of the enum instance.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `write_back` variable is an enum type, and the comparison is made directly with its values, which is not the correct way of comparing enum values.

The correction to this issue will involve checking the value of the `write_back` enum instead of directly comparing it with its values. We're also adding a check for `write_back.NO` to account for all possible enum values.

The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from enum import Enum

class WriteBack(Enum):
    YES = 1
    NO = 0
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    elif write_back == WriteBack.NO:
        return False  # Need to handle this case explicitly
    return True
