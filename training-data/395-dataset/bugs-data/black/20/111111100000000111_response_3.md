The bug in the provided function `format_file_in_place` is with the comparison of the `write_back` parameter. In the function signature, `write_back` is supposed to be of type `WriteBack`, but in the comparison statements, it is being compared to `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the incorrect comparison is being made against `write_back`, which is a custom enum type, rather than checking the enum's values.

To fix the bug, the comparison inside the function needs to be changed to compare against the enum values rather than the enum itself.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from enum import Enum
from typing import Any
import tokenize
import sys

class WriteBack(Enum):
    YES = "yes"
    NO = "no"
    DIFF = "diff"

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the comparison against the `write_back` parameter is now done using the enum values `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF` instead of comparing directly with `write_back`.
