The bug in the provided function is likely causing the test case to fail. The error message indicates that the expected and actual diff outputs are not matching. This discrepancy is likely due to the incorrect formatting of file paths in the diff lines.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the construction of the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables. These variables are being constructed using `src.name`, which may not be the correct way to obtain the file name for the diff output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not properly formatting the file paths for the diff output. The incorrect file paths are leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual diff outputs, causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the file paths for `src_name` and `dst_name` should be constructed from the `src` parameter using its `name` attribute. Additionally, the `lock` variable should be properly managed to avoid any potential race conditions in a multiprocessing environment.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
from io import StringIO
import os
import black

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: black.WriteBack = black.WriteBack.NO,
    lock: any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with open(src, "r", encoding="utf-8") as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == black.WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == black.WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(
            src_contents, dst_contents, str(src), str(src)  # Using str(src) to obtain the full file path
        )
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

With these corrections, the function should now properly format the file paths for the diff output, effectively addressing the bug and allowing the test case to pass successfully.
