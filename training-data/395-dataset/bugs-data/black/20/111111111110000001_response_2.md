The error occurs in the `test_expression_diff` test function, where the test is comparing the expected and actual outputs. The test is failing because the actual diff output is different from the expected output.

The bug in the `format_file_in_place` function is that it is referencing an undefined variable `FileContent` in the function signature. It should be importing `FileContent` from the required module. Additionally, `write_back.YES` should be replaced with `WriteBack.YES` to match the defined enum values.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the `FileContent` class from the required module.
2. Replace `write_back.YES` with `WriteBack.YES` to match the defined enum values.

Here is the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Path
from enum import Enum
import sys
import tokenize

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool) -> FileContent:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def diff(a: str, b: str, a_name: str, b_name: str) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
