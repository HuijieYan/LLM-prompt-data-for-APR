The bug in the provided function is related to the `write_back` parameter, which is of type `WriteBack` and has two options: `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF`. However, in the original function, these options are accessed without specifying their full paths (e.g., write_back.YES or write_back.DIFF).

The error message indicates that when running `black --diff path/to/foo.py`, the diff output does not display the full file path, which makes it hard to read several concatenated diffs.

To fix this bug, the function needs to access the `WriteBack` options with their full paths. This will ensure that the full file path is displayed in the diff output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any

class WriteBack(Enum):
    YES = "YES"
    DIFF = "DIFF"
    NO = "NO"

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
