The test function `test_expression_diff` is trying to compare the expected diff with the actual diff generated by the `format_file_in_place` function. The error message indicates that the expected diff isn't equal to the actual diff.

Based on the error and expected outcome, the issue seems to be with the filepath used in the actual diff. The expected value of `src_name` and `dst_name` in the diff content should be the full file path, but it is currently not matching the expected outcome. This is the potential error location within the problematic function.

The incorrect implementation of `src.name` and `dst.name` is causing the issues. The file names are being passed instead of the full file path, which is causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the `format_file_in_place` function should use the full file path instead of just the file name when generating `src_name` and `dst_name`. This will enable the test case to compare the expected and actual diff content accurately.

Here is the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = str(src) + "  (original)"
        dst_name = str(src) + "  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

By using `str(src)` to get the full file path and appending " (original)" and " (formatted)" strings, the corrected function ensures that the full file path is used in the diff content. This fix should allow the test case to pass and resolve the issue with the incorrect diff output.
