During the execution of the test function `test_expression_diff` from the file `test_black.py`, an assertion error occurred in the `self.assertEqual(expected, actual, msg)` statement. This error was due to the fact that the expected difference in the file `expression.diff` did not match the actual difference obtained when the `format_file_in_place` function (referred to as `ff` in the test) was invoked with the `write_back` parameter set to `WriteBack.DIFF`.

The potential error location within the `format_file_in_place` function is likely the comparison logic for the `write_back` parameter and the subsequent handling of the file content reformatted differences. 

The reason for the error is that the `write_back` parameter is intended to control the handling of the reformatted content. However, the function is not processing the case when `write_back` is set to `WriteBack.DIFF` correctly, leading to differences in the reformatted file content that do not match the expected differences.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `write_back` parameter, specifically for the `WriteBack.DIFF` case, needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Any
from pathlib import Path

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: Any = None,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    if write_back is None:
        write_back = WriteBack.NO

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In this corrected function, the handling of the `write_back` parameter and its comparison with `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF` has been adjusted. Additionally, the default value for the `write_back` parameter is set to `None` to ensure that it can be properly validated against the `WriteBack` enum.
