Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug lies within the conditional check for write_back in the 'format_file_in_place' function. In the provided code, the conditional check is using an incorrect syntax for comparing the 'write_back' variable with 'write_back.YES' and 'write_back.DIFF' enums. Additionally, the 'lock' variable is used improperly. The error message from the test function indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual diff outputs, signaling a bug in the logic flow or variable handling.

Reasons for the bug might include incorrect usage of enumerations and the lock variable. The improper use of these variables leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect diff outputs, causing the test to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Correct the conditional checks for 'write_back' enum by using 'write_back == WriteBack.YES' and 'write_back == WriteBack.DIFF'.
2. Properly handle the 'lock' variable, including acquiring and releasing the lock at the appropriate places.

Here's the corrected code for the 'format_file_in_place' function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
