The error in the code is related to the manipulation of the file content when using the `format_file_in_place` function. The error occurs when attempting to compare the expected difference in the file content with the actual difference after formatting, resulting in an assertion failure.

The potential error location is in the section of the code that writes the reformatted content back to the file or generates a diff for the content. The issue may be related to how the file content is being processed or written.

The bug occurs because the code is not correctly handling the file content manipulation when attempting to write the reformatted content back to the file or generating a diff for the content.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the file content is correctly read, processed, and written back to the file or used to generate the diff. 

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys

def format_file_in_place(
        src: Path,
        line_length: int,
        fast: bool,
        write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
        lock: Any = None  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()

    # Function to format file contents
    def format_contents(contents):
        try:
            return format_file_contents(contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast)
        except NothingChanged:
            return contents

    dst_contents = format_contents(src_contents)

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()

    return dst_contents != src_contents
```

This corrected code ensures that the file content is correctly processed and manipulated, and the reformatted content is correctly written back to the file or used to generate the diff.
