The error seems to be occurring due to incorrect use of the `src` path and naming conventions inside the `format_file_in_place` function. The original code is incorrectly using the `src` path rather than `src.name` when creating `src_name` and `dst_name`.

To fix the bug, we need to use `src.name` to access the name of the file associated with the `src` path.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
import sys
from tokenize import tokenize

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, I've changed `src` to `src.name` when creating `src_name` and `dst_name`, and also replaced `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` with `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF` respectively, to use the enumeration properly.
