Potential Error:
The error lies in the usage of the enum value `write_back` in the function `format_file_in_place`. The `write_back` enum is being compared using `==` instead of `is` as itâ€™s an enum and should be compared using the `is` operator. Additionally, the default value for the `write_back` parameter is incorrect and should be `WriteBack.NO` instead of `None`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the incorrect comparison operator is used for comparing enum values. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the comparison operator from `==` to `is` when comparing enum values.
2. Initialize the `write_back` parameter with the correct default value `WriteBack.NO` instead of `None`.

Corrected Code:
```python
from enum import Enum
import sys
import tokenize
from difflib import unified_diff
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass

def format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length, fast):
    # Your implementation of format_file_contents
    pass

def diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name):
    # Your implementation of diff function
    pass

def format_file_in_place(
        src: Path,
        line_length: int,
        fast: bool,
        write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
        lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.
