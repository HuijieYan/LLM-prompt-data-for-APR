The error message suggests that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual diff output. This discrepancy is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the file contents in the `format_file_in_place` function. 

The issue seems to be related to the possible incorrect handling of file paths, file contents, and diff generation in the `format_file_in_place` function. The mentioned function is responsible for formatting a file's contents in place, and it also handles the generation of a diff if required.

One potential reason for the bug could be related to how the file paths, file contents, or their encoding are being handled within the function. Additionally, the comparison logic for generating the diff output might be incorrect.

To fix the bug, ensure that the file paths are correctly handled, the source and destination file contents are properly read and formatted, and the diff is generated accurately before being returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from io import StringIO
import os
from typing import Any
import tokenize
from filecontent import FileContent  # Assuming FileContent is properly imported

def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool) -> FileContent:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def diff(a: str, b: str, a_name: str, b_name: str) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with src.open() as src_buffer:  # Use the 'open' method on the Path object to read file contents
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:  # Access 'WriteBack' class directly for comparison
        with src.open("w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:  # Use the 'open' method on the Path object to write back to file
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:  # Access 'WriteBack' class directly for comparison
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code:
- The file handling methods have been updated to use `open` and `write` methods directly on the `Path` object.
- The comparison logic for `write_back` options has been updated to directly access the `WriteBack` class for comparison.
- The `format_file_contents` and `diff` functions are assumed to be correctly implemented and handle file formatting and diff generation accordingly.

Please ensure that the assumptions about the `FileContent` and `WriteBack` classes are accurate and revise the imports or implementations as needed.
