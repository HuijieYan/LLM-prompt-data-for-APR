The test case `test_expression_diff` is comparing the expected diff output with the actual diff output. It is failing with an assertion error indicating that the expected and actual diff outputs are not equal.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the diff generation process, specifically in the `diff_contents` variable.

The bug is occurring because the `diff_contents` variable in the buggy function doesn't seem to be generating the expected diff content. This mismatch in the diff content is causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the diff generation logic needs to be revisited. The diff generation process should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that it correctly compares the source and destination contents and generates the diff output as expected.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def format_file_in_place(
        src: Path,
        line_length: int,
        fast: bool,
        write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
        lock: Any = None  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
    ) -> bool:
        """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

        If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
        `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
        """

        with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
            src_contents = src_buffer.read()
        try:
            dst_contents = format_file_contents(
                src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
            )
        except NothingChanged:
            return False

        if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
            with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
                f.write(dst_contents)
        elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
            src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
            dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
            diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
            if lock:
                lock.acquire()
            try:
                sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
            finally:
                if lock:
                    lock.release()
        return True
```

With the corrected code, the diff generation process should now accurately compare the source and destination contents and generate the expected diff output.
