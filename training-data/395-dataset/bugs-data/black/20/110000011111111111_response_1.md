The error is likely occurring in the `format_file_in_place` function, where the `src.name` attribute is used in place of `src`, resulting in an incorrect filename.

The bug is occurring because the `src.name` attribute is being used in the `format_file_in_place` function instead of `src` itself, leading to an incorrect filename being used for comparison.

To fix the bug, the `src.name` attribute should be replaced with `src` to ensure the correct filename is used for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
import os
from io import StringIO
from typing import Any

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: Any = None,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    with open(src, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `src.name` attribute has been replaced with `src` to ensure the correct filename is used for comparison. Additionally, the `pathlib.Path` module is now being directly used for file operations.
