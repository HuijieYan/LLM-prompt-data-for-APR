The error in the given code is that the function `format_file_in_place` is using an enum `WriteBack` incorrectly. The enum `WriteBack` is not imported from any module and its implementation is not provided. This causes the function to raise an error when trying to compare the enum values.

To fix this issue, we need to import the `Enum` class from the `enum` module, define the `WriteBack` enum, and use it in the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length, fast):
    # Implementation of format_file_contents is not provided.

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is WriteBack.YES, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In this corrected code:
- The `WriteBack` enum is defined with values NO, YES, and DIFF using the `Enum` class from the `enum` module.
- The `WriteBack` enum is used for the `write_back` parameter in the `format_file_in_place` function.

This should resolve the issue related to the incorrect usage of the `WriteBack` enum and allow the function to work as expected.
