Potential error location:
The error in the code is occurring due to the improper handling of file paths when generating the diff in the `format_file_in_place` function.

Reasons behind the bug:
The function is not properly handling the file path and metadata when generating the diff output. This leads to inconsistencies and difficulties in reading and comparing the diffs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the file paths are properly formatted and displayed in the diff output.
2. Use the correct file names and paths when generating the diff to ensure consistency and readability.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
import sys

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: str,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is 'yes', write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False
    
    if write_back.lower() == 'yes':
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back.lower() == 'diff':
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    
    return True
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `write_back` parameter is now of type `str` instead of `WriteBack` enum to handle the values 'yes' and 'diff'.
2. The `write_back` parameter is compared as lowercase strings ('yes' and 'diff').
3. The correct file names and paths are used when generating the diff output.
4. Potential encoding issues are handled when writing back to the file.
