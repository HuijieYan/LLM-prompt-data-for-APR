The main issue with the provided function is the incorrect usage of the `WriteBack` enum. The enum has three values: `WriteBack.NO`, `WriteBack.YES`, and `WriteBack.DIFF`, but the function tries to check for `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`, which does not match the enum values.

The bug occurred because the function is trying to compare the `write_back` parameter with incorrect enum values.

To fix the bug:
- Change the comparison from `write_back.YES` to `WriteBack.YES`.
- Change the comparison from `write_back.DIFF` to `WriteBack.DIFF`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import Any, Union
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys


class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2


class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass


def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool) -> str:
    # Your implementation of format_file_contents
    pass


def diff(src_contents: str, dst_contents: str, src_name: str, dst_name: str) -> str:
    # Your implementation of diff
    pass


def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
