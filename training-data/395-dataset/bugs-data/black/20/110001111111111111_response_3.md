The bug is occurring in the `format_file_in_place` function. The function is supposed to format the contents of a file and show the differences using the provided options. The error message from the test function indicates that the expected and actual diff outputs do not match. This is likely due to incorrect file paths in the output.

The potential error location is when the `src` path is being used to generate `src_name` and `dst_name`. It seems that the file name is not being extracted correctly from the `src` path, resulting in incorrect names in the diff output.

The reason for this bug is that the `src` path is not being processed correctly to extract the file name.

To fix the bug, the `src` path should be processed to extract the file name for `src_name` and `dst_name`. This can be achieved using the `name` attribute of the `Path` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = src.name  # Extracting the file name from src path
        dst_name = src.name  # Using the same file name for dst_name
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

With this correction, the `src` path is properly used to extract the file name for `src_name` and `dst_name`, which should resolve the issue with the incorrect file paths in the diff output.
