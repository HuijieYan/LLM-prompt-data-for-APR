Potential error location: The error may occur in the `write_back` parameter as it is using a custom `WriteBack` enum type, but the comparison is being done directly with `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `write_back` parameter is not being used correctly, and the comparison is being done with a non-existent variable instead of the enum type.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Change the `write_back` enum to use uppercase naming convention to match the comparison with `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`.
2. Use the enum class and compare the `write_back` parameter with `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF` to check for equality.
3. Use the `name` attribute of the enum to compare the string values directly.

from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
import tokenize
import sys

    YES = 1
    NO = 0
    DIFF = 2

) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
