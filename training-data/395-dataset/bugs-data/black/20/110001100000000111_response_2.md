The bug in the provided code is that the `format_file_in_place` function is not correctly handling the `write_back` argument and the `WriteBack` enum.

The issue is occurring because the `write_back` argument is not being used as expected. Additionally, it seems that the `WriteBack` enum is not being imported or defined correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `write_back` argument is used to determine whether to write the reformatted code back to the file, and we need to properly handle the `WriteBack` enum.

Here is the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
from tokenize import tokenize
import sys

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass

def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool):
    # ... omitted code ...

def diff(a: str, b: str, a_name: str, b_name: str) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, we import the `Enum` class and define the `WriteBack` enum. We also properly use the `WriteBack` enum to check the `write_back` argument and choose the appropriate behavior based on its value.
