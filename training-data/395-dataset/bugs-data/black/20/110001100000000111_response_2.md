The bug in the code seems to be related to the function `format_file_in_place` where the `src_name` and `dst_name` are not being constructed with the full file path before being used in the `diff` function. This results in the --diff option not displaying the full file path.

The reason behind the bug is that the `src_name` and `dst_name` are only constructed with the file name, not the full file path. This results in the --diff option not displaying the full file path.

To fix this bug, we need to construct the `src_name` and `dst_name` with the full file path before passing them to the `diff` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast)
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = str(src) + "  (original)"
        dst_name = str(src) + "  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, we construct the `src_name` and `dst_name` with the full file path by using `str(src)` before passing them to the `diff` function. This should ensure that the full file path is displayed in the --diff output.
