Potential error location: The incorrect indentation and spacing suggest that the "format_file_in_place" function is not properly defined as part of the original code.

Reason for the bug: The "format_file_in_place" function is not aligned properly with the other functions in the file, leading to incorrect formatting and syntax within the code.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Realign the "format_file_in_place" function with proper indentation and spacing to ensure it is defined correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_20/black.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool) -> FileContent:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def diff(a: str, b: str, a_name: str, b_name: str) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Corrected format_file_in_place function

    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,

    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.
