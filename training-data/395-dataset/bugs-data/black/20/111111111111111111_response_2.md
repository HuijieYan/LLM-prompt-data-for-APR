The error occurs when the test function `test_expression_diff` is run. It produces an assertion error due to a mismatch between the expected and actual diff outputs. The error message indicates that the filename is not being displayed correctly in the diff output.

The potential error location is within the `format_file_in_place` function, specifically in the section where the diff output is being created and printed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely the improper handling or construction of the file paths in the diff output. This could be due to incorrect concatenation or formatting of the file names.

To fix the bug, the file paths need to be properly concatenated and formatted to ensure that the full path is displayed in the diff output. This can be achieved by ensuring that the correct file paths are used when constructing the diff message.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
import os
import black

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: black.WriteBack = black.WriteBack.NO,
    lock: any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with open(src, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    src_name = str(src) + "  (original)"
    dst_name = str(src) + "  (formatted)"
    diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
    print(diff_contents)
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `format_file_in_place` function is updated to ensure that the file paths are concatenated correctly to display the full path in the diff output. Additionally, the `diff` function is used to generate the diff content, and the `print` statement is added to display the diff content.
