Potential error location: The issue is likely to be in the `format_file_in_place` function where the `src_name` and `dst_name` are being constructed.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables are being constructed using only the name of the file (`src.name`) instead of the full path.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to construct the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables with the full path of the file.

Corrected code:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = str(src)  # Use str(src) to get the full file path
        dst_name = str(src) + " (formatted)"  # Use str(src) to get the full file path
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables now use `str(src)` to get the full file path, which ensures that the full path is displayed in the `--diff` output.
