The bug seems to be in the `src_name` and `dst_name` variable assignments. The original code is not using the `src.name` to get the file name and is instead using the full path which includes the directory. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior described in the bug report.

The bug occurs because the `src.name` is not being utilized to extract the file name. This results in the full path being used instead, causing the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables to contain the full path instead of just the file name.

To fix the bug, we should use `src.name` to retrieve the file name and use that in the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables. This change will ensure that the expected behavior matches the actual behavior when using the `--diff` option.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

The changes made include using `src.name` to retrieve the file name for `src_name` and `dst_name`. This ensures that the file name is used consistently in the diff output and matches the expected behavior.
