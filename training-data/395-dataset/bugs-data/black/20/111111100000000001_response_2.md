Potential error location: The function is trying to access an enum value `WriteBack.NO`, `write_back.YES`, and `write_back.DIFF`, which are not defined in the given code. These values should be part of an enum class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the enum class `WriteBack` is not defined or imported in the code, so the values `write_back.NO`, `write_back.YES`, and `write_back.DIFF` are not recognized.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Define an enum class `WriteBack` with values `NO`, `YES`, and `DIFF` and import it into the file where the `format_file_in_place` function is defined.

Corrected code:

```python
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys
from typing import Any

# enum class definition
class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

# corrected function
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
