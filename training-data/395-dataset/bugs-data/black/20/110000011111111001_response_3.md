The error occurs in the `test_expression_diff` test function. It seems that the `expected` and `actual` values are not matching, which leads to an `AssertionError`. The error message indicates that the expected and actual diff outputs are different.

The bug in the `format_file_in_place` function is likely due to the incorrect value of `src_name` and `dst_name` being used in the `diff` function. These variables are derived from the original source file's name, but they should be using the final destination file's name.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables contain the correct file names obtained from the final destination file's path.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any, TextIO

def format_file_in_place(src: Path, line_length: int, fast: bool, write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO, lock: Any = None) -> bool:    
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast)
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"  # Use the name of the formatted file
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src.name, dst_name)  # Use the correct dst_name
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

By correcting the assignment of `dst_name` based on the actual name of the formatted file, we ensure that the diff will reflect the correct file names and resolve the bug.
