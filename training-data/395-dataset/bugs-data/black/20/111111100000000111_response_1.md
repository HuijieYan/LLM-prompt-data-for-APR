Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `format_file_in_place` function, specifically with how the file path is handled in the `--diff` output.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `format_file_in_place` function does not include the full path to the file in the `--diff` output, making it difficult to read several concatenated diffs, especially when filenames are duplicated in different directories.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `format_file_in_place` function to include the full file path in the `--diff` output.
2. Update the `diff` function to handle the full file path correctly.
3. Ensure that the file path is properly formatted and included in the `--diff` output.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pathlib import Path

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()

    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `src` path is directly used in creating `src_name` and `dst_name` to include the full path in the `--diff` output. Additionally, the unnecessary comma after `lock: Any = None` has been removed.
