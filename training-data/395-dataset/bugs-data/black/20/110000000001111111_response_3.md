The error is occurring in the `format_file_in_place` function. The issue is that the `src.name` is not being utilized when creating the `src_name` and `dst_name` strings for the diff output.

The bug is caused by the failure to include the file name when creating the src_name and dst_name strings, which results in the diff output not displaying the full file path when using the --diff option.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `src_name` and `dst_name` strings to include the file name. Additionally, we should remove the unnecessary type annotations to ensure the function is compatible with older versions of Python.

Here is the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: 'WriteBack' = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: 'Any' = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast)
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
``` 

In this corrected code, we have removed unnecessary type annotations and updated the `src_name` and `dst_name` strings to include the file name. This will ensure that the full file path is displayed in the --diff output.
