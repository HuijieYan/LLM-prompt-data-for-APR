The bug occurs within the `format_file_in_place` function. The variable `src` is of type `Path`, and the function tries to use its `name` attribute without explicitly accessing it. This likely results in an AttributeError, as `name` is not available as an attribute of `Path`.

To fix this bug, the `name` attribute should be accessed explicitly during the assignment of `src_name`. The corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function is presented below:

```python
# corrected function
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"  # Explicitly accessing 'name' attribute
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"  # Explicitly accessing 'name' attribute
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
In the corrected code, the `name` attribute of `src` is explicitly accessed when assigning `src_name` and `dst_name`. This ensures that the code runs without errors and that the correct filenames are used in subsequent processing.
