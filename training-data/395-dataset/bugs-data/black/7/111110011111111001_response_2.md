The test case `test_tuple_assign` is using the `assertFormatEqual` method to compare the expected and actual outputs. The error message shows that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The bug is likely to be within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function, particularly in the part where it deals with tuples and visibility of parentheses. The function is incorrectly handling the visibility of parentheses for tuples, which leads to the mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The reasons behind the bug could be related to mishandling of parentheses visibility when dealing with tuples, as well as incorrect insertion or removal of parentheses.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the visibility of parentheses for tuples and performs the necessary operations (insertion or removal) accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.

                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")

                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")

                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after

Please note that the corrected code provided above assumes that the logic for handling parentheses visibility and operations within the function is correct. Further testing and integration into the original codebase should be performed to ensure its effectiveness.
