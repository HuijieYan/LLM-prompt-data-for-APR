The error occurs in the `assertFormatEqual` method within the `test_tuple_assign` test case. The test is failing because the `expected` and `actual` strings don't match. This indicates that there is a bug in the `fs` function that is causing it to produce incorrect output.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `normalize_invisible_parens` method, particularly in the section where it manipulates the parentheses and inserts them into the node's children.

The error in the code might be related to the insertion of parentheses and their visibility. It seems that the function is not correctly wrapping elements in visible parentheses or making them invisible when needed.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking and manipulating parentheses is working correctly. This may involve reviewing the conditions for inserting visible parentheses, invisible parentheses, or making existing parentheses invisible based on different scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` method:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    paren_values = ["(", ")"]
    prev_child = None
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if prev_child:
            if prev_child.type == token.COMMA and child.type == token.COMMA:
                # single-element tuple, wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif child.type == token.LPAR and child.value in paren_values:
                # make parentheses invisible
                child.value = ""  # type: ignore
            elif child.type == syms.atom and is_one_tuple(child):
                # make parentheses visible
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after:
            prev_child = child
```

In the corrected code, a consistent approach for handling single-element tuples, visible parentheses, and invisible parentheses is applied. This should resolve the issues causing the test failures.
