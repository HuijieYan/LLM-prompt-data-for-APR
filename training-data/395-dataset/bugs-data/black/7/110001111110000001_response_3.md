The `normalize_invisible_parens` function seems to be the cause of the bug. It appears that this function is involved in modifying the input source code in some way, and this is leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test case.

The error message shows that the expected output is a multi-line tuple containing elements, while the actual output is a single line containing the elements. This suggests that the `normalize_invisible_parens` function might be erroneously modifying the tuples in the input code, leading to this mismatch.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic inside the `normalize_invisible_parens` function and ensure that it does not inadvertently modify the structure of the tuples in the input code. Additionally, the implementation of the `is_one_tuple` function should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly identifies single-element tuples. 

Here is the corrected `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                if len(child.children) == 1:  # Check if it's a single-element tuple
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                    child.remove()
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                # Remain unchanged for "import from" nodes
                break
                
        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

The fixed code includes a check in the `is_one_tuple` section to verify that the tuple has only one element before wrapping it in visible parentheses. This should prevent the function from erroneously modifying the structure of the tuples in the input code.
