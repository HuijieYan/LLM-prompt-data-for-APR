The error message mentions that the left side of a backslashed tuple assignment isn't being shortened. This suggests that there may be a problem with how the `normalize_invisible_parens` function is handling tuple assignments.

The error message from the test function is an `AssertionError` which indicates that the expected and actual values are not equal. The error message also includes the expected and actual values, detailing the differences between them.

Based on the GitHub issue description, it seems that the `normalize_invisible_parens` function is not correctly handling the formatting of the tuple assignment, which is resulting in line length issues.

The potential error location is within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function where tuple assignments are being handled.

To fix the bug, the `normalize_invisible_parens` function needs to be modified to correctly handle formatting of tuple assignments, ensuring that the line length is appropriate.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
# corrected function for normalize_invisible_parens
from typing import List, Set
from black import ProtoComment, FMT_OFF, syms, LN, Leaf, Node, token

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    comments = list_comments(node.prefix)
    for pc in comments:
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after:
            if child.type not in [token.LPAR, token.RPAR]:
                index = child.get_first_leaf().remove()
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                node.insert_child(index, rpar)

    string_labels = set(token.STRING_PREFIXES + token.CONVERSIONS)
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if child.type == syms.lambdef:
            pos = -1
            if child.children[pos].type != token.RPAR:
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ')')
                    child.append_child(rpar)
```
