The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with formatting involving a tuple assignment. The comparison between the expected and actual outputs shows a difference in the formatting of the tuple, leading to an assertion error.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the `normalize_invisible_parens` function has an issue with handling tuple assignments, which is leading to incorrect formatting.

The code fails to handle the formatting of tuple assignments correctly, resulting in the error message seen in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `normalize_invisible_parens` function to correctly handle tuple assignments and ensure that the formatting is handled appropriately. The function logic should be modified to format tuple assignments as expected.

Here is the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from and child.type == token.LPAR:
                # make parentheses invisible
                child.value = ""  # type: ignore
            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                index = child.remove() or 0
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

In the corrected code, the formatting logic for handling tuple assignments has been updated. It now correctly handles tuple assignments to ensure proper formatting, addressing the issue observed in the test function.
