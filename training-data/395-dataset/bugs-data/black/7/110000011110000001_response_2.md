The error seems to be related to the formatting of tuples in the `test_tuple_assign` method. It compares the expected tuple with the actual tuple and finds a mismatch, resulting in an `AssertionError`.

Looking at the `normalize_invisible_parens` function, it seems that the issue lies in how the function manipulates parentheses in the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of Python code. The manipulation of parentheses within this function could be causing the formatting issue observed in the test case.

The function seems to have multiple conditional checks for different scenarios involving parentheses and their visibility. The buggy code could be incorrectly manipulating the structure of the AST, leading to a formatting discrepancy observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, it is important to review and revise the logic for manipulating parentheses within the AST. The function should properly handle the scenarios involving wrapping and removing parentheses, ensuring that it doesn't inadvertently change the structure of the AST in a way that affects the formatting.

Below is a corrected version of the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from typed_ast import ast3 as ast
from typed_ast import ast27 as ast27

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Union[ast.stmt, ast.expr], parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    # Updated the function signature to use Union for handling both types of AST
    if hasattr(node, 'prefix') and isinstance(node.prefix, str):
        # Check for prefix attribute to ensure it's a statement
        for pc in node.prefix:
            if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
                # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
                return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(node.children if hasattr(node, 'children') else node.body):
        if check_lpar:
            if isinstance(child, ast27.Expr) and isinstance(child.value, ast27.Tuple):
                # Check for tuple expression in Python 2.7
                if len(child.value.elts) == 1:
                    # wrap child in visible parentheses if it's a single-element tuple
                    node.prune()
                    node.slice = ast27.Slice(lower=ast27.Lower(), upper=ast27.Upper())
                    node.node = ast27.Tuple(elts=[ast27.Tuple(elts=list(child.value.elts))])
                    node.node.elts[0].ctx = ast.Store()
                else:
                    # keep existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions
                    pass
            elif isinstance(child, ast.Expr) and isinstance(child.value, ast.Tuple):
                # Check for tuple expression in Python 3
                if len(child.value.elts) == 1:
                    # wrap child in visible parentheses if it's a single-element tuple
                    node.prune()
                    node.slice = ast.Slice(lower=ast.UnaryOp(), upper=ast.UnaryOp())
                    node.node = ast.Tuple(elts=[ast.Tuple(elts=list(child.value.elts))])
                    node.node.elts[0].ctx = ast.Store()
                else:
                    # keep existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions
                    pass

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, ast27.Constant if hasattr(ast27, 'Constant') else ast.Str) and child.value in parens_after
```

This corrected code provides better handling of different syntax nodes and their child elements, ensuring that the visible parentheses are managed appropriately without affecting the structure of the AST. Additionally, it addresses the differences between Python versions 2.7 and 3 in handling tuple expressions.
