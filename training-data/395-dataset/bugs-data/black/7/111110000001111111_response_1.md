The error seems to occur when the code encounters a tuple assignment that is not properly handled and causes the line to not be shortened as expected.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of parentheses in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. The function is intended to handle visible and invisible parentheses for different types of expressions, but there seems to be a bug in how it handles tuple assignments.

The bug is likely occurring because the function does not properly check for tuple assignments and handle the parentheses accordingly.

To fix the bug, the `normalize_invisible_parens` function needs to be modified to correctly handle tuple assignments and ensure that the parentheses are properly managed in these cases.

Here is the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after):
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                index = child.remove() or 0
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

This code should properly handle tuple assignments and ensure that the parentheses are managed correctly, potentially addressing the issue with long lines not being shortened as expected.
