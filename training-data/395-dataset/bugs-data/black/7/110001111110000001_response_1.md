The error occurs in the assertFormatEqual method within the test_tuple_assign test case. This error is caused by the mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The potential error location in the problematic function is within the normalize_invisible_parens function, specifically in the block of code where parentheses are added or removed based on certain conditions. It seems that the logic for adding or removing parentheses is flawed, leading to the incorrect output and causing the test case to fail.

The bug likely occurred due to incorrect handling of parentheses in various conditions. The logic for adding, removing, and wrapping parentheses around children nodes within the normalize_invisible_parens function is faulty, leading to an incorrect transformation of the input code. As a result, the output does not match the expected output, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic for adding, removing, and wrapping parentheses around children nodes needs to be carefully reviewed and refactored. Additionally, handling of different node types and conditions should be thoroughly tested to ensure that the transformation of the input code accurately produces the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from black import FMT_OFF, Node, ProtoComment, LN, Leaf, token, syms

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            return
    
    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar and isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after:
            if node.type == syms.import_from and child.type == token.LPAR:
                child.value = ""  # make parentheses invisible
                node.children[-1].value = ""
            elif isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.type != token.STAR:
                # insert invisible parentheses
                node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                node.insert_child(index + 1, Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
            else:
                if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value not in parens_after:
                    # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    node.insert_child(index, lpar)
                    node.insert_child(index + 2, rpar)
                elif isinstance(child, LN):
                    normalize_invisible_parens(child, parens_after)
    
        check_lpar = child.type == syms.atom or (is_one_tuple(child) and child.type != syms.list_display)
```
It's important to thoroughly test this corrected code to ensure that the bug has been fixed and that the function works as expected.
