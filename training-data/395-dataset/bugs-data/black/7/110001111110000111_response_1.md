The error message is showing an assertion error, indicating that the actual output does not match the expected output. The long line is 95 characters, which suggests that the lines are not being shortened properly in the output.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the `normalize_invisible_parens` function is not handling tuple assignments correctly, which is causing the lines to exceed the character limit.

The issue is occurring because the function is not properly wrapping the tuple assignments in parentheses or invisible parentheses as needed, leading to longer lines than expected.

To fix the bug, the `normalize_invisible_parens` function should properly handle tuple assignments and wrap them in parentheses or invisible parentheses as needed to ensure the lines do not exceed the character limit.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immeditely after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after:
            if len(node.children) == 3:
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                node.insert_child(0, lpar)
                node.append_child(rpar)
            break
```

This corrected function should handle tuple assignments properly and ensure that the lines do not exceed the character limit as observed in the error message.
