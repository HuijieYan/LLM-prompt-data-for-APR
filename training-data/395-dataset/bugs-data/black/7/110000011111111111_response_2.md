The test case is trying to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `fs` function. The assertion fails because the expected output is a string with line breaks and the actual output is not formatted the same way.

The buggy function `normalize_invisible_parens` is likely causing the issue because it manipulates the code involving parentheses and tuples, which could affect the formatting of the code.

The bug seems to occur when the function manipulates tuples and makes changes to the visibility of parentheses, causing the formatting to be different from the expected output in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to review the logic in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function that deals with tuples and parentheses. We should ensure that any changes made to the visibility of parentheses do not affect the overall formatting of the code.

Here's the corrected version of the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                if child.type == token.LPAR:
                    child.value = ""
                    node.children[-1].value = ""
                elif child.type != token.STAR:
                    node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                    node.append_child(Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
                break
            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                index = child.remove() or 0
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

By reviewing the logic in the function and ensuring that the manipulation of parentheses does not affect the overall formatting of the code, we can address the bug and ensure that the test case passes as expected.
