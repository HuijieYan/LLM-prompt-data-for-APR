The bug seems to be related to the `normalize_invisible_parens` function, which is modifying the syntax tree of the input node. The error message indicates that the formatting of the code is not as expected, which can be caused by incorrect manipulation of parentheses in the syntax tree.

The potential error location is within the `for` loop where the code checks for `check_lpar` and manipulates the parentheses. It appears that the logic for adding or removing parentheses is not functioning as expected.

One possible reason for the bug might be that the handling of parentheses addition or removal is not properly considering all the cases for different types of nodes and child nodes within the syntax tree. This could lead to incorrect formatting when the code is rebuilt from the modified tree.

To fix the bug, the logic for adding, removing, or modifying parentheses based on the type of node and child nodes should be reviewed. It might be necessary to handle the different cases separately to ensure that the correct formatting is maintained.

Here's a corrected version of the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    child.replace([lpar, child, rpar])
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.replace([lpar, child, rpar])
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                # "import from" nodes store parentheses directly as part of the statement
                if child.type == token.LPAR:
                    # make parentheses invisible
                    child.value = ""  # type: ignore
                    node.children[-1].value = ""  # type: ignore
                elif child.type != token.STAR:
                    # insert invisible parentheses
                    node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                    node.insert_child(index + 1, Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
                break

            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                child.replace([lpar, child, rpar])
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling parentheses addition and removal is adjusted based on the type and properties of the nodes and their child nodes. This should address the issue of incorrect code formatting and maintain the integrity of the syntax tree.
