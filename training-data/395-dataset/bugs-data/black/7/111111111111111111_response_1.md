It appears that the buggy function is not correctly handling the tuple assignment with a backslash at the end of the line.

The error message from the test function indicates that the line is not being shortened when it starts as a backslashed tuple assignment left side. This suggests that the function is not properly handling the formatting of the tuple assignment in this specific case, leading to incorrect output.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the `normalize_invisible_parens` function to properly handle the tuple assignment with a backslash at the end of the line. This may involve modifying the logic that inserts or removes parentheses for different types of nodes and ensuring the correct formatting in this specific case.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    # existing code...

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    child.append(lpar)
                    child.extend(rpar)
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            # rest of the conditions as per the original code...

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

This corrected code should address the formatting issue with the backslashed tuple assignment left side while also ensuring that the function behaves correctly in other cases.
