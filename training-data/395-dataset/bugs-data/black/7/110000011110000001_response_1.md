The error is occurring in the `assertFormatEqual` method of a test case called `test_tuple_assign`. This test case compares the expected output with the actual output, and it fails with an assertion error. This error indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output.

The potential error location within the `normalize_invisible_parens` method could be the logic related to adding or removing parentheses around expressions. It seems that the logic for adding and removing parentheses is not working as intended, leading to a difference between the expected and actual output.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect logic in the `normalize_invisible_parens` method when handling parentheses around expressions. The existing logic in the method is not effectively handling the addition or removal of parentheses according to the provided specifications.

To fix the bug, the logic for adding and removing parentheses should be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the conditions for when to add or remove parentheses should be validated to ensure that they align with the requirements specified in the function documentation.

Below is the corrected implementation of the problematic `normalize_invisible_parens` method:

```python
from typing import Set
from lib2to3.pgen2 import token
from lib2to3.pytree import Node, Leaf
from lib2to3.pygram import python_symbols as syms

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    #  Updated and corrected implementation of the method to fix the bug
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = node.children.index(child)
                    node.children.insert(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
                    node.children.remove(child)
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                node.children.insert(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                # "import from" nodes store parentheses directly as part of
                # the statement
                if child.type == token.LPAR:
                    # make parentheses invisible
                    child.value = ""  # type: ignore
                    node.children[-1].value = ""  # type: ignore
                elif child.type != token.STAR:
                    # insert invisible parentheses
                    node.children.insert(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                    node.children.insert(index + 1, Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
                break
            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                index = node.children.index(child)
                node.children.insert(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
                node.children.remove(child)

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
