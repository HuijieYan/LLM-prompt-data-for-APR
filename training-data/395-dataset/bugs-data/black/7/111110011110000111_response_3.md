The error message from the test function indicates that the output from the function `fs` (which calls the buggy `normalize_invisible_parens` function) is incorrect. The assertion fails because the expected and actual outputs do not match. The error message also provides a comparison between the expected and actual outputs.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function is identified. It seems that the function is not handling tuples and their parentheses correctly, leading to invalid output and failing the test case.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of parentheses in tuple assignments. The current implementation of the function fails to properly handle tuple assignments, resulting in incorrect formatting. This is likely the cause of the assertion failure in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for adding and removing parentheses within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function, specifically focusing on the handling of tuple assignments.
2. Make sure that the function correctly identifies tuple assignments and handles parentheses accordingly, both for single-element tuples and for multi-element tuples.
3. Update the logic to properly insert and remove parentheses based on the specific requirements for tuple assignments.

Corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.
    
    ... (rest of the docstring unchanged) ...

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif is_one_tuple(child) or (is_tuple(child) and len(child.children) == 1):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses for single-element tuples as well
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                # ... (remaining code for import_from logic) ...
                # No change to the import_from logic
            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                index = child.remove() or 0
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

The corrected code includes modifications to correctly handle single-element tuples in addition to other tuple assignment scenarios. After applying these fixes, the `normalize_invisible_parens` function should handle the tuple assignments correctly, resolving the formatting issue and resulting in passing test cases.
