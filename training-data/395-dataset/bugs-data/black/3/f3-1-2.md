Describe the bug

--check returns 1 when invalid --config is specified, not some higher error code as implied. This can make debugging issues tricky for CI integrations relying on return codes. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a bug, but it was a bit unexpected to me.

(It also happens without --check.)

To Reproduce

$ printf "def a():\n    pass\n" | black - --check; echo "return: $?"
def a():
    pass
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file left unchanged.
return: 0
$ printf "def a():\n    pass\n" | black - --check --config "foo"; echo "return: $?"
Error: Could not open file foo: Error reading configuration file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'foo'
return: 1
Expected behavior

--check says:

Don't write the files back, just return the status. Return code 0 means nothing would change. Return code 1 means some files would be reformatted. Return code 123 means there was an internal error.

So I would expect this case to return an error code other than 1.

Environment (please complete the following information):

Version: 19.10b0, master (both tested)
OS and Python version: macOS 10.15.3 with Python 3.7.7; and Ubuntu 18.04.4 with Python 3.6.9
Does this bug also happen on master?

Yes (tested via cloning and pipenv shell)

Additional context

This can be very awkward to debug in a CI environment if you rely on return codes only.
