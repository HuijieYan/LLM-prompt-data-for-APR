The error message indicates that the "ModelWithConfig" object does not have the attribute "json_encoders" within its "Config" class. This leads to an AttributeError when the function attempts to access this attribute.

The potential error location within the function is in the block that checks for the existence of "Config.json_encoders" within the "BaseModel" class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "ModelWithConfig" class does not have the "json_encoders" attribute defined within its "Config" class. Therefore, trying to access this attribute directly leads to an AttributeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to first check whether the "json_encoders" attribute exists within the "Config" class of the object before trying to access it. If it exists, use it, otherwise use a default logic.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        json_encoders = getattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders', None)
        if json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

```

In the corrected code, we use the `getattr` function to check for the existence of the "json_encoders" attribute within the "Config" class of the object. If it exists, we use it, otherwise we proceed with the default logic.
