The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the 'Config' attribute of the 'obj' object. This suggests that the 'Config' attribute is being accessed statically (i.e., as a class attribute) rather than from an instance of the class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the following line:
```python
if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'Config' attribute is being accessed directly from the class 'ModelWithConfig' rather than from an instance of it. It seems that the intention is to access the 'Config' attribute from the instance 'obj' rather than the class.

To fix the bug, the 'Config' attribute should be accessed from the instance 'obj' rather than the class itself. This can be achieved by modifying the code to access 'Config' through the instance 'obj' as follows:

```python
if not obj.config.json_encoders:  # Assuming 'config' is the correct attribute name
```

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if not getattr(obj, "Config").json_encoders:  # Access 'Config' through instance 'obj'
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=getattr(obj, "Config").json_encoders,  # Access 'Config' through instance 'obj'
            )
    if isinstance(obj, Enum):
        return obj.value
    # ... (omitted other code)
    # No change in the rest of the function
```
