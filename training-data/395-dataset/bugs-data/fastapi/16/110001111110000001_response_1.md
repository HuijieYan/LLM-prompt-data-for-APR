Potential error location: It appears that the error is occurring in the if condition `if not obj.Config.json_encoders`, specifically with the attribute `json_encoders`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error message indicates that the `Config` attribute of the `obj` does not have the attribute `json_encoders`. This means that the `Config` class does not have the `json_encoders` attribute defined, resulting in the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the `Config` class has the `json_encoders` attribute defined. If it does not, then this attribute should be added to the `Config` class.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the case where the `json_encoders` attribute is not present in the `Config` class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') and obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same) ...
```

In the corrected code, before accessing the `json_encoders` attribute of the `Config` class, we first check if it exists using the `hasattr` function. If it exists and is truthy, we use it as the `custom_encoder` parameter in the subsequent function call. If it does not exist or is falsy, we proceed with the original behavior of the function.
