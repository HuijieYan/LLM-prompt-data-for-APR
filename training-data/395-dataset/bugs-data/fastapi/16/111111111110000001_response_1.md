The error message indicates that the attribute 'json_encoders' is not found in the 'Config' object of the 'obj' object. This suggests that there is a problem with accessing the 'json_encoders' attribute within the 'Config' object.

The bug is occurring in the conditional statement:
```python
if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
```
This is trying to access the 'json_encoders' attribute within the 'Config' object of the 'obj' object.

The bug occurs because the 'Config' object does not have the 'json_encoders' attribute.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statement to check if the 'Config' object is present in 'obj' and if it has the 'json_encoders' attribute.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, GeneratorType
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj, 'Config') and getattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders', None):
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # ... (other conditions remain the same) ...
```

With this fix, the function first checks if the 'Config' object is present in 'obj' and if it has the 'json_encoders' attribute. If so, it uses the custom encoder from the 'Config' object; otherwise, it proceeds without the custom encoder.
