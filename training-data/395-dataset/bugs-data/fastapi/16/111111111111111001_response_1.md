The provided error message and the test case indicate that the attribute 'json_encoders' is being accessed on the class 'Config'. However, this attribute is not defined in the 'Config' class, leading to the 'AttributeError' during the test execution.

The potential error location in the code is within the conditional check for 'obj.Config.json_encoders' in the 'jsonable_encoder' function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is attempting to access an attribute that does not exist on the 'Config' class. This leads to the 'AttributeError' when the test case is executed.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to check if the attribute 'json_encoders' exists on the object's configuration before accessing it. If it does not exist, the function should handle this scenario accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the 'jsonable_encoder' function:

```python
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        config = getattr(obj, "Config", None)
        if config and not getattr(config, "json_encoders", None):
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=config.json_encoders,
            )
    # ... (other conditions and logic remain unchanged) ...
```

In the corrected code, the 'config' object is used to check if the 'json_encoders' attribute exists. If it does, it is accessed accordingly. If not, the function handles the scenario and continues with the appropriate logic.
