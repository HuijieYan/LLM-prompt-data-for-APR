The error occurred because the code is trying to access the 'json_encoders' attribute of the 'Config' class, which does not exist. This is evident from the error message stating "AttributeError: type object 'Config' has no attribute 'json_encoders'."

The potential error location within the problematic function is the if condition where it checks for 'obj.Config.json_encoders'. Since the 'Config' class does not have the 'json_encoders' attribute, it results in an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to handle the situation where 'json_encoders' attribute does not exist within the 'Config' class. It can be modified to check for the existence of 'json_encoders' attribute in the 'Config' class before accessing it.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') and obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

By checking the existence of the 'json_encoders' attribute using the hasattr() function, we can avoid the AttributeError. If the attribute exists and is non-empty, the custom encoder from the 'Config' class is used. Otherwise, the default encoder is used.
