Potential error location: The error occurs within the `jsonable_encoder` function when it tries to access `obj.Config.json_encoders`. This indicates that the `Config` attribute is not present on the `obj`, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `jsonable_encoder` function assumes that the `obj` has a `Config` attribute with `json_encoders` defined. However, in the test case, `ModelWithConfig` does not have a `Config` attribute with `json_encoders`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `Config` attribute exists on the `obj` before accessing `json_encoders`.
2. If the `Config` attribute does not exist, handle this situation gracefully, such as by using a default value or raising a more informative exception.
3. Consider modifying the `ModelWithConfig` class to ensure that it has a `Config` attribute with `json_encoders` defined to align it with the assumption in the `jsonable_encoder` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, GeneratorType
from enum import Enum


ENCODERS_BY_TYPE = {
    int: lambda x: x,
    float: lambda x: x,
    str: lambda x: x,
    type(None): lambda x: x,
}

class BaseModel:
    pass

class ModelWithConfig(BaseModel):
    class Config:
        json_encoders = {}

class RoleEnum(Enum):
    admin = "admin"

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if hasattr(obj, 'Config') and hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') and obj.Config.json_encoders:
        if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
            if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
                return jsonable_encoder(
                    obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                    include_none=include_none,
                )
            else:
                return jsonable_encoder(
                    obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                    include_none=include_none,
                    custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
                )
    if isinstance(obj, Enum):
        return obj.value
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code includes a check for the existence of `Config` and `json_encoders` before attempting to access them, avoiding the `AttributeError` that was previously occurring.
