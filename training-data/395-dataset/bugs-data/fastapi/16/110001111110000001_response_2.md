1. The test case `test_encode_model_with_config` is trying to encode a `ModelWithConfig` object using the `jsonable_encoder` function. The expected result is a dictionary with the role attribute. However, the error message indicates that the `Config` attribute does not have the `json_encoders` attribute, causing an AttributeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that checks for the existence of `json_encoders` in the `Config` attribute of the `obj`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `jsonable_encoder` function is trying to access the `json_encoders` attribute of the `Config` class within the `obj` object. However, the `Config` class does not have a `json_encoders` attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check for the existence of the `Config` attribute within the `obj` and then access the `json_encoders` attribute if present. If the `json_encoders` attribute exists, it should be used for encoding, otherwise the default encoding should be applied.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel
from types import GeneratorType

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj, 'Config') and hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') and obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

With this corrected code, we first check if the `Config` attribute exists within the `obj` object and if it has the `json_encoders` attribute. If it does, we use it for encoding. If it doesn't, we perform the default encoding. This approach resolves the AttributeError and ensures proper encoding based on the presence of `json_encoders`.
