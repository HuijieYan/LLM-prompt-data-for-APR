The error message indicates that the code is trying to access the attribute `json_encoders` from the class `Config` which does not exist. This means that the `json_encoders` attribute is missing from the `Config` class, resulting in an `AttributeError`. It seems that the intention is to check if the `json_encoders` attribute exists within the `Config` class, but this is not being done properly.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to access the `json_encoders` attribute from the `Config` class properly. We also need to make sure that the `Config` class and its attributes are imported properly.

The corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, GeneratorType
from enum import Enum

# Assuming the appropriate imports are present for BaseModel, ModelWithConfig, RoleEnum, and ENCODERS_BY_TYPE

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if hasattr(obj.__class__, "Config") and hasattr(obj.__class__.Config, "json_encoders"):
        if not obj.__class__.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.__class__.Config.json_encoders,
            )
    # remaining code for other types of objects...
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `Config` class and `json_encoders` attribute exist within the object's class using the `hasattr` function. If they exist, we access the `json_encoders` attribute from the `Config` class properly. This should resolve the `AttributeError` issue.
