The error message indicates that the `Config` attribute does not have an attribute called `json_encoders`. This points to the potential error location being within the conditional check for `obj.Config.json_encoders` in the `jsonable_encoder` function.

The bug occurred because the `jsonable_encoder` function is trying to access the `json_encoders` attribute of the `Config` class within the `obj` object. However, it seems like the `Config` class does not have this attribute, resulting in the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `Config` class within the `obj` object has the `json_encoders` attribute. If it does, we should use it; otherwise, we should use a default behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, Generator, Type

# Updated function signature
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = None,
) -> Any:
    if custom_encoder is None:
        custom_encoder = {}

    if hasattr(obj, "Config") and hasattr(obj.Config, "json_encoders"):
        json_encoders = obj.Config.json_encoders
    else:
        json_encoders = {}

    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        return jsonable_encoder(
            obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
            include_none=include_none,
            custom_encoder=json_encoders,
        )

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

By using the `hasattr` function, we can check for the existence of the `json_encoders` attribute within the `Config` class of the `obj` object. If it exists, we use it; otherwise, we fall back to an empty dictionary. This should fix the bug and prevent the AttributeError.
