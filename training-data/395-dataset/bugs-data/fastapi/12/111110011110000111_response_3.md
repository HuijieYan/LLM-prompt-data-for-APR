The test case is trying to authenticate a user using the "Authorization" header with the value "Basic notreally". The test expects a 200 status code, but instead, it receives a 403 status code, indicating an authentication error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for the scheme in the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class. The current implementation only allows the "bearer" scheme, and any other scheme will raise a 403 status code error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional check for the scheme does not allow any other authentication scheme except "bearer", leading to a 403 error for the "Basic" scheme used in the test.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for the scheme needs to be modified to allow the "Basic" scheme. If the scheme is not "bearer", the function should return None instead of raising a 403 error.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
