The potential error in the provided function is the use of `async` keyword without any `await` inside the function. This function is not actually performing any asynchronous task, so the `async` keyword is unnecessary and the function should be a regular synchronous function.

The function is also missing the definition of the `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials` class, which is being used to return the result.

To fix the bug, the `async` keyword should be removed and the `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials` class should be defined as follows:

```python
from typing import Optional

class HTTPAuthorizationCredentials:
    def __init__(self, scheme: str, credentials: str):
        self.scheme = scheme
        self.credentials = credentials
```

Once the class is defined, the corrected function would look like this:

```python
from typing import Optional
from fastapi import HTTPException, Request
from starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN

def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
