Potential error:
The potential error in the code is that the function does not handle the case when the authorization header is missing or malformed. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the function is called.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the scenario when the authorization header is missing or malformed. This can result in the function trying to access an attribute of a `None` object, leading to a `NoneType` error.

Approach to fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add error handling for the case when the authorization header is missing or malformed. This can be done by checking if the `authorization` variable is `None` or empty, and handling it accordingly.

Corrected code:
```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
        
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
