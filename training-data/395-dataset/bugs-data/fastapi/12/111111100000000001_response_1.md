Potential Error and Reason:
The potential error in the given code is that the get_authorization_scheme_param function is being used without being imported or defined in the class file. This would result in a NameError when trying to call this function.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the get_authorization_scheme_param function needs to be imported or defined within the class file so that it can be used within the __call__ method.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

# import get_authorization_scheme_param function
from some_module import get_authorization_scheme_param

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __call__ function
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
