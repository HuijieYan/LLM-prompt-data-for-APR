Potential error location: The bug may be in the condition `if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):` as it is checking for both `authorization` and `scheme` and `credentials` to be present, which might not always be the case.

Reason for the bug: The condition is trying to check for the presence of both `authorization` and `scheme` and `credentials`, but the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function does not always return all three values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `authorization` is not None before trying to split it into `scheme` and `credentials`.
2. Add checks for `scheme` and `credentials` separately to handle cases where they might be None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: Optional[str] = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
