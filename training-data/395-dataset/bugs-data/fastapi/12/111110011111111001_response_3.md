The bug is occurring in the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect scheme and credentials, which is leading to a 403 Forbidden error instead of the expected 200 status code.

The bug occurs because the function does not honor the `auto_error` attribute when the scheme is not "bearer", instead it always raises a `HTTPException` with status code 403.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check the value of `self.auto_error` before raising the exception when the scheme is not "bearer".

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class:

```python
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            else:
                return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With the corrected code, the function will now correctly check the value of `self.auto_error` before raising the exception, which should fix the bug.
