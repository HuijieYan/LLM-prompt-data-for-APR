Potential error location: The error occurs when the test function tries to assert that the response status code should be 200, but it is actually 403.

Reason for the bug: The buggy function is not handling the case where the scheme is not "bearer" correctly. In this case, it should return a 403 status code, but it is not doing so.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the scheme is not "bearer" and return a 403 status code with an appropriate error message.
- Handle the case where the authorization is not present or if the credentials are empty.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
