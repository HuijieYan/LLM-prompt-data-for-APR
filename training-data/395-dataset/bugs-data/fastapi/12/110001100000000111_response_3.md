Potential Error Location:
The potential error in this code is that the function is catching an HTTPException and returning None if the auto_error flag is set to False, but it is not handling the case where the scheme is not 'bearer' properly.

Reason behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the authorization scheme is not 'bearer' correctly. It only checks for the presence of the authorization header and the scheme, but it does not handle the scenario where the scheme is not 'bearer'.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if the scheme is not 'bearer' and raise an HTTPException with the appropriate error message. This will ensure that the function handles all possible scenarios for the authorization header.

Corrected Code:
```python
from fastapi import HTTPException, Request
from fastapi.security import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from fastapi.security.utils import get_authorization_scheme_param
from starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
from typing import Optional

# this is the corrected function
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
