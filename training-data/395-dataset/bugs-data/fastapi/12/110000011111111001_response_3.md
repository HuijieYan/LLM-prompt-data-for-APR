The test case is expecting a status code of 200, but it received a status code of 403 instead. This indicates that the buggy function is not handling the authentication correctly, as it is returning a 403 status code instead of 200.

The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect handling of the "Authorization" header. The function is checking for the scheme to be "bearer" and throwing a 403 status code if it's not. However, in the test case, the scheme is "Basic" and the credentials are "notreally", so the function should return None instead of throwing a 403 status code.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to return None if the scheme is not "bearer" and the credentials are not valid for the "bearer" scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if authorization is None or scheme is None or credentials is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
