Potential error:
The potential error in the code is that it is not handling the case when the "Authorization" header is missing from the request.

Reason for the bug:
The buggy function does not handle the case when the "Authorization" header is missing from the request, which can lead to an AttributeError when trying to get the scheme and credentials from the header.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that the "Authorization" header is present before trying to extract the scheme and credentials from it. If the header is missing, we should handle it appropriately, either by raising an HTTPException or returning None based on the value of `auto_error`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not authorization:
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Authorization header is missing"
                )
            else:
                return None
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
