The potential error location within the problematic function is around the handling of incorrect credentials in the "test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials" test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the "Basic" authentication scheme properly. The function is only checking for the "Bearer" authentication scheme and does not handle other schemes like "Basic".

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the function to handle different authentication schemes, including "Basic". If the authentication scheme is "Basic", it should raise an HTTPException with the appropriate status code and detail message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not scheme or not credentials:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
