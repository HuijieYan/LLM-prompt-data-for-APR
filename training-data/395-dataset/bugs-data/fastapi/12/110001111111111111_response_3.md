The bug in the code is likely to be caused by the incorrect behavior of the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class. The method is supposed to handle the "Authorization" header in HTTP requests and extract the credentials. However, the current implementation does not handle the "Basic" authentication scheme properly.

Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the expected behavior is for the server to respond with a 403 Forbidden status code when the incorrect "Basic" authentication scheme is provided. However, the server is currently responding with a 200 OK status code, indicating that the buggy function is not behaving as expected.

To fix this issue, the `__call__` method should be modified to properly handle the "Basic" authentication scheme. The corrected code for the `__call__` method is as follows:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not scheme or not credentials:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication scheme"
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, the `scheme` and `credentials` extraction logic is moved below the check for the existence of the "Authorization" header. This ensures that the code will handle the "Basic" authentication scheme properly and respond with the correct status codes.
