The test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is trying to make a request with incorrect credentials, but it expects the status code to be 200, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to return a status code of 403 with a message indicating that the authentication credentials are invalid.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional checks for the scheme and credentials. If the scheme is not "bearer", it should return a status code of 403 with an appropriate error message.

The bug occurred because the function did not handle the case where the scheme is not "bearer" correctly. It returned a status code of 200 instead of 403.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks to return a status code of 403 with the correct error message when the scheme is not "bearer".

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
``` 

With the corrected code, when the scheme is not "bearer", it will raise an HTTPException with a status code of 403 and the appropriate error message, which should resolve the bug.
