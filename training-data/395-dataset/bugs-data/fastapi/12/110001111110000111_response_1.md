The test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is checking the status code of the response when an incorrect "Authorization" header is sent. The expected behavior is that when an incorrect "Authorization" header is sent, the response status code should be 403, but the actual status code is 200, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `__call__` method is the comparison of the lowercase scheme with "bearer" and raising the HTTPException with status code 403.

The bug occurs because the scheme in the "Authorization" header is expected to be "Bearer" (with a capital 'B'), but the comparison in the code is done with a lowercase 'bearer'. This causes the comparison to fail and the incorrect status code to be returned in the response.

To fix the bug, you need to update the comparison of the scheme to be case-insensitive and also modify the response status code when an incorrect "Authorization" header is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected code, the scheme comparison is case-insensitive and the response status code is modified based on the conditions. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass successfully.
