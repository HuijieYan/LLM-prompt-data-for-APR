The bug in the provided function is likely causing the test to fail with a 403 status code instead of the expected 200 status code.

The potential error location lies within the conditional statement that checks the validity of the authorization scheme. The bug seems to be in the check for the scheme being "bearer" which should not cause a 403 error but rather return None in case of an invalid authentication scheme.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of an invalid authentication scheme properly.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to return None when the authorization scheme is not "bearer" rather than raising a 403 error.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None  # Return None for invalid authentication scheme
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
