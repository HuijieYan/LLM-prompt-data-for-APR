Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the line `scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)` where the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is not defined within the scope of the provided code. 

Reason for the Bug:
The `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is being used without being defined, hence causing a NameError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function within the scope of the provided code if it is a custom function.
2. If `get_authorization_scheme_param` is a standard library function, import it from the respective library.

Corrected Code:
Assuming `get_authorization_scheme_param` is a custom function, the corrected code can be as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # the corrected function
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = self.get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    
    def get_authorization_scheme_param(self, authorization: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
        # implement the logic to extract scheme and credentials from the authorization header
        # example:
        # split the authorization header by space and get the scheme and credentials
        parts = authorization.split(" ")
        if len(parts) == 2:
            return parts[0], parts[1]
        else:
            return "", ""
