Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the conditional check for the existence of `authorization`, `scheme`, and `credentials`.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional check is not performing correctly. It is not properly validating the presence of `authorization`, `scheme`, and `credentials`, which could lead to incorrect authentication handling.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditional check to properly validate the presence of `authorization`, `scheme`, and `credentials`.
2. Use separate `if` statements to check each variable individually for existence.
3. Ensure that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is providing the correct values for `scheme` and `credentials`.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if authorization:
            scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
            if scheme and credentials:
                if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
                    raise HTTPException(
                        status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                        detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                    )
                return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
```
