The error in the provided code is in the logic of the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class. The function is supposed to handle authentication using the Bearer token scheme. However, in the test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials()`, the test is expecting a status code of 200, but it is receiving a 403 status code instead.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the scheme is not "bearer" correctly. In the given test case, the authorization scheme is "Basic" instead of "Bearer", which should result in a 403 status code, as indicated in the error message.

To fix the bug, the `__call__` method should first check if the authorization scheme is "Bearer". If it is not "Bearer", then it should raise a `HTTPException` with a 403 status code and the detail "Invalid authentication credentials".

Below is the corrected code for the `__call__` method:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle the case where the authorization scheme is not "Bearer", and the test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` should pass with a 403 status code.
