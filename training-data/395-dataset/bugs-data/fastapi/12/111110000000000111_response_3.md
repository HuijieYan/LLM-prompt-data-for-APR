The potential error in the given code is with the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function, as it is not defined within the provided code snippet. Additionally, it's not clear if `HTTPBase` is properly imported and defined.

The reason behind the bug is that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is not defined within the provided code. So, when the `scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)` line is executed, it will result in a `NameError` since the function is not found.

To fix the bug, the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function needs to be defined and imported properly. Additionally, ensure that the `HTTPBase` class is properly defined and imported.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if authorization is None:
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        parts = authorization.split()
        if len(parts) != 2 or parts[0].lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=parts[0], credentials=parts[1])
```
