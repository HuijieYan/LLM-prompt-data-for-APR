Potential error location:
The potential error lies in the if condition where it checks if the authorization, scheme, and credentials are all present. If any of these are missing, the function will return None if the auto_error flag is not set, instead of raising an HTTPException as intended.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the auto_error flag is not set, and it should raise an HTTPException when the required credentials are not present.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to add a condition to raise an HTTPException when the auto_error flag is not set and the required credentials are not present.

Corrected code:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail="Authorization header is missing"
            )
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
