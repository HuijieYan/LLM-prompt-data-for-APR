The error message from the test function indicates that the HTTPBearer function is not handling the incorrect scheme and credentials correctly, resulting in a status code of 403 (forbidden) instead of 200 (OK).

The potential error location within the HTTPBearer function is in the 'if scheme.lower() != "bearer"' block where it raises an HTTPException with status code 403, indicating invalid authentication credentials.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the scenario when the scheme is not "bearer", causing it to raise an exception instead of handling the incorrect credentials gracefully.

To fix the bug, the function should return an HTTPException with status code 403 only if the scheme is "bearer" and the credentials are not valid. Otherwise, it should return None to indicate that the authentication is not successful.

Here's the corrected code for the HTTPBearer function:

```python
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer" or not valid_credentials(credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            else:
                return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, if the scheme is not "bearer" or the credentials are not valid, the function returns None instead of raising an exception, which aligns with the expected behavior. It also takes into account the validity of the credentials using a hypothetical 'valid_credentials' function.
