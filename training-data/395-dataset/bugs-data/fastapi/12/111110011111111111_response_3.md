It seems that the test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is expecting a 200 status code but receiving a 403 status code instead. This suggests that the issue lies within the HTTPBearer class and specifically within the `__call__` method where the authorization is being checked.

The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case of "Basic" authentication scheme properly. It should only accept the "Bearer" authentication scheme.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `__call__` method to only consider the case when the authorization scheme is "Bearer". If it's not "Bearer", it should return a 403 status code with the appropriate error message. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not authorization:
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this correction, the `__call__` method checks if the authorization scheme is "Bearer". If it's not, it will raise a 403 status code with the appropriate error message. This should address the issue experienced in the test case.
