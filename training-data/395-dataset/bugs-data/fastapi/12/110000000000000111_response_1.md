The potential error in the function is within the conditional check for the presence of "Authorization" and the correct scheme. The bug occurs because the conditional check for the presence of "Authorization", scheme, and credentials is not implemented correctly. It checks for them separately instead of checking for the whole tuple or dictionary at once.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for the presence of "Authorization", scheme, and credentials should be combined using the 'and' operator. This will ensure that all components are present before attempting to extract the scheme and credentials.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
