The error message from the test function indicates that the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code returned by the function is 403, causing the assertion to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that checks the scheme of the authorization. The condition `if scheme.lower() != "bearer"` is causing the function to always raise a 403 status code when the scheme is not "bearer", which is incorrect behavior for the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case where the authorization scheme is not "bearer". It should only raise a 403 status code if the authorization scheme is "bearer", not for any other case.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to only raise a 403 status code if the authorization scheme is "bearer", and return None for any other case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() == "bearer":
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    else:
        return None
```
With this modification, the function will only raise a 403 status code if the authorization scheme is "bearer", and return None for any other case. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
