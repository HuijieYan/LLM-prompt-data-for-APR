The potential error in the provided code is the use of the `await` keyword in the function signature without an asynchronous operation within the function body. Asynchronous functions in Python should have at least one `await` statement inside the function body to make it actually asynchronous.

The `async` keyword in Python is used to define a coroutine, which allows for asynchronous execution. However, in the provided code, there are no asynchronous operations or `await` statements inside the `__call__` function, making it incorrect to declare it as an async function.

To fix the bug, the `async` keyword should be removed from the function signature. The corrected function code is as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...


    def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
