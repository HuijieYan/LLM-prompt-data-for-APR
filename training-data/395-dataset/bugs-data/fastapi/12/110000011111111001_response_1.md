The error occurs when the test function is asserting that the response status code should be 200, but it is actually returning 403. This indicates that the function is not handling incorrect scheme credentials properly, as it should return a 200 status code instead of 403 in this case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition `if scheme.lower() != "bearer":`. This condition is checking if the scheme is not "bearer", but we need to handle the case when the scheme is "basic" instead of "bearer".

The bug occurs because the function only checks for the "bearer" scheme and raises a 403 status code if the scheme is anything else. It should instead return a 200 status code and a message indicating that the credentials are incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the problematic function to handle the "basic" scheme and return a 200 status code with the appropriate message when the credentials are incorrect.

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None  # modify this line to return None when the scheme is incorrect
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

By modifying the function to return None when the scheme is incorrect, the test case should now pass as expected.
