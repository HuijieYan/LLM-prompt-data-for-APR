The test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is sending a request with the "Authorization" header set to "Basic notreally". According to the provided function, this should result in a 403 Forbidden error with the message "Invalid authentication credentials". However, the test is currently expecting a 200 OK response.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the scheme. The function is incorrectly checking for the presence of a "bearer" scheme, but the test is sending a "basic" scheme.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the scheme is not "bearer" correctly. It is directly raising a 403 Forbidden error without checking the scheme first.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check the scheme and only raise the error if the scheme is not "bearer". If the scheme is "bearer" but the credentials are incorrect, it should return a 403 Forbidden error with the message "Invalid authentication credentials".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional
from fastapi import HTTPException
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.types import Headers
from fastapi.security.http import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials, get_authorization_scheme_param
from fastapi.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected code, the function will now properly check for the "bearer" scheme and return a 403 Forbidden error with the correct message if the scheme is not "bearer" or if the credentials are incorrect. This should resolve the error in the test case.
