The error occurs in the test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` because the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code is 403, indicating a forbidden access error.

The potential error in the `__call__` function is with the check for the scheme. The function checks if the scheme is "bearer", and if it's not, it raises a 403 Forbidden error. However, in the test case, the authorization scheme is "Basic" instead of "Bearer", causing the function to raise the 403 error.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle other authorization schemes gracefully, without raising an error if the scheme is not "Bearer". Instead, we can return `None` in that case.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None  # Return None instead of raising an error
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this correction, the function will no longer raise an error if the authorization scheme is not "Bearer". Instead, it will return `None`, allowing the control flow to continue without an error if the scheme is different.
