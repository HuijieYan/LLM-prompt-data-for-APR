The buggy function is intended to extract and validate the bearer token from the Authorization header in the request. However, there are several issues with the code:

1. The function incorrectly extracts the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header using the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. 
2. The function does not handle the case where the authorization header is missing, resulting in a potential AttributeError when trying to access the `scheme` and `credentials` variables.
3. The function does not handle the case where the scheme is not "bearer" in a manner that allows for a clean exit.


To fix these issues, the code should be revised to correctly extract the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header, handle the missing Authorization header case, and handle the invalid scheme case more effectively. 

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException
from starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
from typing import Optional

class CustomHTTPBearer(HTTPBearer):
    async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not authorization:
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        scheme, credentials = authorization.split(' ', 1)
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
