The potential error in the provided function is that it checks for the authentication scheme to be "bearer" but does not handle the case where the scheme is "basic", which results in the function raising an HTTPException with "Invalid authentication credentials" when the scheme is not "bearer".

To fix this issue, the function needs to handle the case where the scheme is "basic" and return None if the authentication scheme is other than "bearer" or if the authorization header is missing.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from starlette.requests import Request
from fastapi import HTTPException
from fastapi.security.http import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from fastapi.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
from typing import Optional


class MyBearer(HTTPBearer):
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not authorization:
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            else:
                return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the authorization header is present. If not, we return None if auto_error is False, or raise an HTTPException with "Not authenticated" if auto_error is True. If the authorization header is present, we then check if the scheme is "bearer". If not, we return None if auto_error is False, or raise an HTTPException with "Invalid authentication credentials" if auto_error is True. This handles the case where the scheme is "basic" and properly handles the auto_error flag.
