The test function `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is sending a request to the server with headers containing an "Authorization" field with the value "Basic notreally". The test is expecting a status code of 200, but it's receiving a status code of 403, which is causing the assertion error.

The buggy function `__call__` in the `HTTPBearer` class is responsible for handling the incoming request headers and checking the authorization scheme. In this case, the function checks if the scheme is "bearer", and if not, it raises an HTTPException with status code 403.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not handling the case when the authorization scheme is not "bearer" and is instead "basic". This causes the function to raise an HTTPException with a 403 status code, which is not what the test function is expecting.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__call__` function in the `HTTPBearer` class to handle the case when the authorization scheme is not "bearer". Instead of raising an HTTPException in this case, we want to return a value of `None` to indicate that the authorization is not valid.

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` function in the `HTTPBearer` class:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None  # Return None for incorrect authorization scheme
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this modification, the function will now return `None` instead of raising an HTTPException with a 403 status code when the authorization scheme is not "bearer". This should fix the bug and make the test function pass.
