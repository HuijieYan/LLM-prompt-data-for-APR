The test case "test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials" is failing with an assertion error because the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code is 403. This indicates that the function is not behaving as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if scheme.lower() != "bearer"`. This condition is checking if the scheme is not equal to "bearer", which would result in raising an HTTPException with status code 403.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition is checking for an exact match of the scheme with "bearer" in lowercase. If the scheme is not exactly "bearer" in lowercase, it raises the exception, leading to a 403 status code.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to check if the scheme does not start with "bearer " (with a space after "bearer"). This will allow for case-insensitive comparison and ensure that any valid bearer scheme is accepted.

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if not scheme.lower().startswith("bearer "):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
