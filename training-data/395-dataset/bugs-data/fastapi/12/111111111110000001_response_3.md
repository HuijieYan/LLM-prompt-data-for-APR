The error occurs in the test function test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials, where the response status code is expected to be 200, but it is actually 403. This indicates that there is an issue with the authentication process in the HTTPBearer function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional check for the scheme.lower() != "bearer". This condition checks the lowercase scheme against "bearer", and if it does not match, it raises a 403 error. However, in the test case, the authorization header is set to "Basic notreally", which is not the scheme "bearer". This causes the function to return a 403 error, leading to the failed test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check to handle cases where the scheme is not "bearer" but does not necessarily imply invalid authentication credentials. Instead of immediately raising a 403 error, we can simply return None to indicate that the authentication credentials are not valid.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not scheme or not credentials:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None  # Not raising an error here, just returning None
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
