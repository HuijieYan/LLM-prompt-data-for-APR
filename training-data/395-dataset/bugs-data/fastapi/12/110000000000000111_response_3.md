Potential Error Location: The error could be occurring in the line "scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)" as the function get_authorization_scheme_param is not defined in the provided code. 

Reason for the Bug: The function get_authorization_scheme_param is not defined in the provided code, so calling this function will result in an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Define the get_authorization_scheme_param function within the same module or import it if it's defined in a separate module.
2. If the get_authorization_scheme_param function is an external library or service, make sure it is installed and accessible.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import Optional
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException, HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
from fastapi.security import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = authorization.split(" ")
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
``` 
In the corrected code, I've removed the call to get_authorization_scheme_param and directly split the authorization header to extract the scheme and credentials. This should address the issue and provide the expected functionality.
