Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is with the check for `scheme.lower() != "bearer"`. This check is case-sensitive and may fail if the scheme is in uppercase.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison `scheme.lower() != "bearer"` is not case-insensitive. If the scheme is in uppercase, the comparison will fail and raise an `HTTPException`.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `scheme` and the comparison string "bearer" to lowercase.

Corrected code:
```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":  # Make the comparison case-insensitive
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
