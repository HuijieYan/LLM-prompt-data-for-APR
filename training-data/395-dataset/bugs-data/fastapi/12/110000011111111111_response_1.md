The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the authorization scheme. The function assumes that the authorization scheme will always be "Bearer", but it should actually check for "Basic" in this case.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly assumes that the authorization scheme will always be "Bearer". However, in the provided test case, the authorization scheme is "Basic", which causes the function to raise a 403 error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the "Basic" authorization scheme and return an error if it is not "Bearer".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly check for the "Bearer" scheme and raise a 403 error if the scheme is not "Bearer".
