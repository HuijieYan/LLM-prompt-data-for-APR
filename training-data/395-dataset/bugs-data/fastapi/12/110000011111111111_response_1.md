The test case "test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials" is trying to access a restricted endpoint "/users/me" with incorrect authorization credentials. The expected behavior is to return a status code of 403 and a message indicating the invalid authentication credentials.

The bug in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the "Basic" authentication scheme. The function should check for the "Bearer" authentication scheme instead.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks for the "Bearer" authentication scheme and instead looks for the "Basic" authentication scheme. As a result, the function does not raise the appropriate exception when encountering incorrect authentication credentials.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for the "Bearer" authentication scheme, and raise an exception if the scheme does not match.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.datastructures import Headers
from typing import Optional

class HTTPAuthorizationCredentials:
    def __init__(self, scheme: str, credentials: str):
        self.scheme = scheme
        self.credentials = credentials

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=403, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, the function checks for the "Bearer" authentication scheme and raises an exception if the scheme does not match. This should fix the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
