The test case is designed to make a request with incorrect credentials, which is expected to result in a 403 status code. The error message indicates that the response status code was 403 instead of the expected 200, which signals that the buggy function is not behaving as intended.

The potential error location within the buggy function is when the scheme is checked. It is currently checking if the scheme is equal to "bearer", which should be a case-insensitive comparison.

The bug occurred because the comparison of the scheme is case-sensitive. In the buggy function, the comparison of the scheme is not case-insensitive, causing it to not recognize the "Basic" scheme as invalid.

To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison of the scheme to be case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
