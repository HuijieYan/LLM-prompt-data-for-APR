The error message from the test function indicates that the response status code is 403 (Forbidden) instead of the expected 200 (OK). This suggests that the buggy function is not handling the authorization correctly and is returning a 403 status code when it should not.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the scheme in the `if scheme.lower() != "bearer":` block. This block is incorrectly treating the 'Basic' scheme as invalid and returning a 403 status code.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the 'Basic' scheme properly and immediately returns a 403 status code.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the 'Basic' scheme correctly and only return a 403 status code if the scheme is missing or not 'Bearer'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the authorization header is missing and handle that case accordingly. Then we extract the scheme and credentials, and if they are not present, we return an error. Finally, we check if the scheme is 'Bearer', and if not, we return a 403 status code. This way, the function correctly handles the different scenarios and returns the appropriate status codes.
