The potential error location within the problematic function is in the check for the validity of the authentication credentials. The function is currently checking if the scheme.lower() is not equal to "bearer" and raising an exception if it doesn't match, which is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking the scheme of the credentials. The bug is likely occurring because the function is expecting the credentials to be in the "Bearer" scheme, but in the given input, it's in the "Basic" scheme.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where the credentials are in the "Basic" scheme and return an appropriate response.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:
```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
