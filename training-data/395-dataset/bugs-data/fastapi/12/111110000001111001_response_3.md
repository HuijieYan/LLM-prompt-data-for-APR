The issue with the provided buggy function is that it assumes the presence of the "Bearer" authentication scheme, and it does not handle other schemes such as "Basic" properly. The function checks for the scheme to be "bearer" and raises an exception if it's not, without considering other cases.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle different authentication schemes correctly. We can achieve this by checking the scheme type and handling each case accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
            
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
            
    if scheme.lower() == "bearer":
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    else:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
```

With this corrected code, we first check if the `Authorization` header exists. If it does, we then extract the scheme and credentials and handle each case accordingly. If the scheme is "bearer", we return the credentials wrapped in `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials`. If it's not "bearer", we raise an exception. If `auto_error` is not set, we return None for both invalid cases.
