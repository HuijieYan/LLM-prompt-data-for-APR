The bug in the provided function is that it is checking for the "bearer" scheme, but the input request has "Basic" as the scheme. This causes the function to raise an HTTPException with a status code of 403, indicating that the authentication credentials are invalid.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the "Basic" authentication scheme correctly and not raise an exception in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if there is no authorization header and handle it accordingly. Then, we extract the scheme and credentials and check if they exist before proceeding. If the scheme is not "bearer", we handle that case as well to avoid raising an exception.

This corrected code should handle both "bearer" and "Basic" schemes appropriately and not raise unnecessary exceptions.
