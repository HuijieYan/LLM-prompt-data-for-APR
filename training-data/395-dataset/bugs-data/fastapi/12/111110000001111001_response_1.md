The potential error in the provided buggy function is the incorrect comparison of the scheme with the string "bearer". The buggy function is meant to check if the scheme in the authorization header is "bearer", but it wrongly checks if it's "bearer" in lowercase, which can cause the function to raise an HTTPException with the message "Invalid authentication credentials" even when the scheme is actually "Bearer".

To fix this bug, the comparison should be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the scheme and the comparison string to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
