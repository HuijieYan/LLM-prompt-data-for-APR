The buggy function is supposed to parse the Authorization header and return the credentials if the scheme is "Bearer". However, the bug occurs when the function incorrectly identifies the scheme as "Basic" instead of "Bearer" and continues to process the credentials.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly parse the authorization header to extract the scheme and credentials. The get_authorization_scheme_param function is likely returning the incorrect values, and the function does not handle this case properly.

To fix the bug, we should use the correct method to parse the Authorization header and extract the scheme and credentials. We can use the split method to separate the Authorization header into its components. We should also handle the case where the scheme is not "Bearer" by raising an HTTPException.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = authorization.split(" ", 1)
    if scheme.lower() != "Bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the Authorization header exists. If not, we return an HTTPException or None based on the value of self.auto_error. If the header exists, we split it into the scheme and credentials using the split method. Then we check if the scheme is "Bearer" and return the credentials. If the scheme is not "Bearer", we raise an HTTPException.
