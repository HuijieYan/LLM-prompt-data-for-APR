Potential Error Location:
The buggy function is checking for the scheme to be "bearer" and returning an instance of `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials`, but the test case is expecting a 403 status code for invalid credentials.

Reason for the Bug:
The buggy function is not handling the case where the scheme is not "bearer" and is simply raising an HTTPException with status code 403. This causes the test case to fail because it expects the status code to be 200.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to modify the buggy function to handle the case where the scheme is not "bearer" and return the appropriate status code and message. 

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
``` 

With the corrected code, if the scheme is not "bearer", it will raise an HTTPException with status code 403 and the detail "Invalid authentication credentials". The test case should pass with this correction.
