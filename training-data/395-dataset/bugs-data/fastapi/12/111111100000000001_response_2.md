Potential error location: The error might occur in the `get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)` function call, which is not defined within the provided code snippet.

Reasons for the bug: The bug might occur due to the absence of the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function or its incorrect implementation. This function is used to extract the authorization scheme and credentials from the "Authorization" header, and if it is not working properly, the function will encounter errors.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define or update the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function to correctly extract the authorization scheme and credentials from the "Authorization" header.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    parts = authorization.split()
    if len(parts) != 2:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authorization header",
        )
    scheme, credentials = parts
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
