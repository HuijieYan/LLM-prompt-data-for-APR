The error message indicates that the actual response status code is 403, but the test is expecting a status code of 200. This suggests that the authentication is failing, and the expected response of 200 is not being achieved.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the authentication scheme. The function is currently raising a HTTPException with a status code of 403 if the scheme is not "bearer". This is likely causing the authentication to fail, resulting in a status code of 403.

To fix this, the check for the authentication scheme should be modified. Instead of raising a HTTPException with a status code of 403, the function should return None if the scheme is not "bearer".

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
