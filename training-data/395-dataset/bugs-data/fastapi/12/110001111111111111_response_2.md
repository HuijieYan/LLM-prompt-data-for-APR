The error occurs because the authorization scheme is "Basic" instead of "Bearer" as expected by the function. This causes the function to raise a 403 error, which leads to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the authentication scheme is "Bearer" before proceeding with the authorization process. If the scheme is not "Bearer", then we should return `None` instead of raising a 403 error.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

# this is the corrected function
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this correction, if the authorization scheme is not "Bearer", the function will return `None` instead of raising a 403 error, and the test case should pass.
