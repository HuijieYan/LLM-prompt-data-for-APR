The error is occurring in the test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials()` where it is expected that the response status code should be 200, but it is actually returning 403. This likely means that the function is not handling the case of incorrect credentials properly and is returning a 403 status code instead of letting it pass with a 200 status code.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the verification of the `scheme` variable and the subsequent raising of the `HTTPException` with the status code of 403.

The bug is occurring because the function is not properly handling the case where the scheme in the authorization header is not "bearer". Instead of simply returning None in this situation, it is raising a 403 status code.

To fix the bug, the function needs to include a check for the case where the scheme is not "bearer" and return None or raise a different type of exception, rather than immediately raising a 403 status code.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this correction, when the scheme is not "bearer", the function will return None instead of raising a 403 status code. This fix should address the issue with the test case failing.
