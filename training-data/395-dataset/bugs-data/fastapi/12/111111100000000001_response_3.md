Potential error location: The potential error in the code is in the if statement checking for the presence of authorization, scheme, and credentials. The condition `if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):` might not work as intended.

Reasons behind the bug: The condition `if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):` checks if all three variables are truthy. However, if any of the variables is an empty string or None, the condition may still evaluate to True, leading to an incorrect result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of using `if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):`, we can check each variable separately for None or empty strings. Additionally, we can use the `or` operator to combine the checks for the variables.

Corrected code:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme is None or credentials is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
In the corrected code, we first check if `authorization` is None, and then check if `scheme` or `credentials` are None individually. This approach ensures that each variable is properly checked for its existence and avoids the unintended behavior of the original code.
