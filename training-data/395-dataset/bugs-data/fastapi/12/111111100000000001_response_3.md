The potential error in the provided code is in the line that checks for the existence of the "Authorization" header:

```python
if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
```

The bug in the code is that it is checking for the existence of `scheme` and `credentials` after extracting them from the authorization header. This check should be performed before extracting the scheme and credentials.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the `authorization` header exists and then extract the scheme and credentials. If the authorization header is not present, or if the scheme and credentials are not extracted successfully, it should raise an HTTPException.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")

    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )

    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
