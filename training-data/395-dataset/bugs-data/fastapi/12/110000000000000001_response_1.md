Potential error location: The potential error in the code lies in the line "scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)" as the function "get_authorization_scheme_param" is not defined in the provided code.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is trying to call a function "get_authorization_scheme_param" which is not defined within the provided source code. This leads to a NameError when the code is executed.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define the function "get_authorization_scheme_param" within the code or import it from an external module if it is defined elsewhere. Additionally, handle any potential exceptions that may occur when parsing the authorization header.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    parts = authorization.split()
    if len(parts) != 2:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authorization header",
        )

    scheme, credentials = parts
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication scheme",
        )
        
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
