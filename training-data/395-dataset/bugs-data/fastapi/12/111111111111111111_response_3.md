Based on the provided information, it seems that the problem is occurring due to incorrect handling of the "Basic" authentication scheme in the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class.

The bug occurs because the code is not checking for the "Basic" scheme and is directly returning an `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials` object, which is causing the test to fail with a 403 status code instead of the expected 200 status code.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__call__` method to specifically handle the "Basic" scheme and return an appropriate response.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    if scheme.lower() == "basic":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Incorrect authentication scheme"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the updated code, we added a check for the "Basic" scheme and returned a response with a 403 status code and an appropriate error message. This should ensure that the test case passes with the expected 200 status code.
