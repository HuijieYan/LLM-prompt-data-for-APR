The bug is likely occurring in the `HTTPBearer` class' `__call__` method, specifically in the check for the scheme in the `authorization` header. The bug appears to be that the method returns None when it should be raising an HTTPException with status code 403 if the scheme in the `authorization` header is not "bearer".

The `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` function is intended to test the case when the authorization scheme in the header is "Basic" instead of "Bearer". The test expects the response status code to be 200, but it actually receives 403, causing the assertion error.

To fix the bug, the `__call__` method should raise an `HTTPException` with status code 403 if the authorization scheme is not "bearer", rather than returning None.

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` method:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
