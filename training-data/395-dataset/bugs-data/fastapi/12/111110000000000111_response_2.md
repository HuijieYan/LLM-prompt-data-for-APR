The potential error in the provided code is with the if condition checking for the existence of 'authorization', 'scheme', and 'credentials' variables. It's checking if all three variables are present, but it should be checking if any one of them is missing.

The bug occurs because the current condition checks whether all three variables exist, which is not the intended logic. The intention seems to be to check if any one of them is missing. As a result, the else block is never executed, even if 'authorization' is missing.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the condition to check if any of the variables is missing, and return the HTTPException if so.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if authorization:
            scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
            if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
        
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
```
