Potential error location:
- The potential error in the code is with the line `scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)`. The `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is not defined in the provided code, which will result in a NameError.

Reason behind the bug:
- The code is trying to call a function `get_authorization_scheme_param` that has not been defined or imported, causing a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Define or import the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function in the code.
- If the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is supposed to be a part of another module, import it from that module.

Corrected code:

```python
# Import the necessary modules or define the get_authorization_scheme_param function if not already defined
# Assuming get_authorization_scheme_param is a function that extracts the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header

from some_module import get_authorization_scheme_param  # import statement if get_authorization_scheme_param is in some_module


class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        # Define or import the 'get_authorization_scheme_param' function here
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
