The error message from the test function indicates that the test is expecting a 200 status code, but the actual status code returned is 403. This suggests that the authentication check in the HTTPBearer class is failing when it shouldn't.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if scheme.lower() != "bearer":`. It seems that the current implementation is checking for the lowercase string "bearer" in the scheme, but the test is passing "Basic notreally".

The bug occurs because the scheme comparison `if scheme.lower() != "bearer":` is case-sensitive. It should be case-insensitive to allow for different variations of the "bearer" scheme (e.g., "Bearer", "bEaReR", etc.).

To fix the bug, we need to change the comparison to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the scheme and the comparison string to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
