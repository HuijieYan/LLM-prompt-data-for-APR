The potential error in the code is with the use of `async` keyword in the function definition. The `__call__` function should not be marked as `async` and instead should be a regular synchronous function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is defined as an async function, but it does not contain any awaitable code or asynchronous operations.
2. The use of `async` in this context is unnecessary and incorrect.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Remove the `async` keyword from the function definition, and remove the dependency on asynchronous operations within the function.

```python
from typing import Optional
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException
from starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN

def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
