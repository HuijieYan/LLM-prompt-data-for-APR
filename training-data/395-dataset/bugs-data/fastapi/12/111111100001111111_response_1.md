The error seems to be occurring due to the incorrect validation of the authorization scheme and credentials within the buggy function. The function is not checking for the "Basic" scheme correctly and may also not be handling different schemes properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the validation logic to properly handle different authorization schemes and their corresponding credentials.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication scheme",
        )
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
``` 

In the corrected code:
1. We first check if the authorization header exists, if not, return a 403 error or None based on the `self.auto_error` flag.
2. Then we extract the scheme and credentials from the authorization header using the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function.
3. Next, we validate if both the scheme and credentials are present. If not, we return a 403 error or None based on the `self.auto_error` flag.
4. Lastly, we validate if the scheme is "bearer". If not, we return a 403 error.
5. If all validations pass, we return the HTTPAuthorizationCredentials.
