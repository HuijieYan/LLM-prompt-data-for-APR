The issue with the provided function is that it is checking for the scheme to be "bearer" in a case-sensitive manner. This results in the function raising an HTTPException even when the scheme is "Bearer" instead of "bearer".

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison for the scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":  # Perform a case-insensitive comparison
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
