Potential error location: 
The error could be at the `get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)` function call, as it seems to be incorrectly identifying the scheme and credentials from the 'Authorization' header.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is not correctly extracting the scheme and credentials from the 'Authorization' header, causing issues in the conditional checks and the subsequent return values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the implementation of the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function to ensure it correctly extracts the scheme and credentials from the 'Authorization' header.
2. Verify that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is functioning as expected and returns the correct tuple of (scheme, credentials).

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = authorization.split(' ', 1)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we directly split the `authorization` string to extract the scheme and credentials, instead of using the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function. This should address the issue of incorrectly identifying the scheme and credentials.
