The bug in the provided code is that it assumes the authentication scheme to be "bearer" and raises an exception if it is not. However, the buggy case 1 input parameters show that the authorization scheme is "Basic", which causes the function to raise an exception.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code to handle the "Basic" authentication scheme as well.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
