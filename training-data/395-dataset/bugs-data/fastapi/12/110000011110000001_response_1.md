The test case "test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials" is expecting a status code of 200, but the actual response returns a status code of 403. This indicates that the function is not handling incorrect scheme and credentials properly, resulting in the wrong status code being returned.

The potential error location is the condition checking for the scheme. The function is checking if the scheme is not "bearer" and raising 403, but it should be doing the opposite - it should raise 403 if the scheme is not "bearer".

The bug occurs because the conditional check for the scheme is incorrect. Additionally, the function is not handling the case where the authorization header is missing, which can also lead to a 403 response.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for the scheme should be inverted, and the function should explicitly handle the case where the authorization header is missing.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
