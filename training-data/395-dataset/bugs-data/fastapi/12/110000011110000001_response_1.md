Potential Error Location: The potential error is likely in the __call__ method of the buggy function. Specifically, the if condition checking for the scheme to be "bearer" might not be functioning correctly.

Reason behind the Bug: The bug might be occurring because the __call__ method is not handling the "Authorization" header properly. It does not correctly check for the bearer scheme and does not return the appropriate response in case of incorrect or missing credentials.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the existence of the "Authorization" header before trying to extract the scheme and credentials.
2. Ensure that the method returns the appropriate HTTP status code and response message for different failure scenarios such as missing credentials or incorrect schemes.

Corrected Code:
```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException, HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
from typing import Optional

async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization:
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if scheme and credentials:
            if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    if self.auto_error:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
        )
    else:
        return None
```
