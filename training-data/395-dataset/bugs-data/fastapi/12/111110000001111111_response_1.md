The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect handling of the authentication scheme. The function is supposed to handle the "Bearer" authentication scheme, but it is currently only checking for the "Basic" scheme.

The bug occurs in the following line of code:
```python
if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
```

The bug occurs because the function is only checking if the scheme is "bearer" in lowercase, but the actual comparison should be case-insensitive. Additionally, the function should handle the "Basic" scheme differently from the "Bearer" scheme.

To fix the bug, the comparison for the "Bearer" scheme should be case-insensitive, and the "Basic" scheme should be handled separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication scheme"
            )
        else:
            return None

    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
