The potential error in the given function is the incorrect usage of the "Authorization" header. The function is trying to extract the scheme and credentials from the "Authorization" header using the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function, which is not provided in the code.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly extracting the scheme and credentials from the "Authorization" header, which leads to incorrect authentication checks and potential HTTPException raises.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly parse the "Authorization" header to extract the scheme and credentials, and then perform the necessary checks based on the extracted values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")

    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    try:
        scheme, credentials = authorization.split(" ")
    except ValueError:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
        )

    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We first check if the authorization header is present. If not, an HTTPException is raised or None is returned based on the value of `self.auto_error`.
2. We split the authorization header to extract the scheme and credentials using the `split` method.
3. We then perform the necessary checks and raise an HTTPException if the checks fail.
