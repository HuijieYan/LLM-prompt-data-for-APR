The test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is expecting the status code to be 200, but it's actually getting a 403 status code, which is causing the assertion error.

The potential error in the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class is in the section where it checks the scheme of the authorization header. It only allows the "bearer" scheme and anything else will raise a 403 status code.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the scheme is not "Bearer" properly. It should return a 403 status code with the appropriate message rather than allowing the request to go through with a 200 status code.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to return a 403 status code if the scheme is not "Bearer".

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class:

```python
async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization or not authorization.lower().startswith("bearer"):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid or missing authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
