The error in the given function is that it is not correctly extracting the credentials from the Authorization header. The function `get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)` is supposed to extract the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header, but the implementation of this function is not provided. 

To fix the bug, we need to first define the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function to correctly extract the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header. Then, we can use the extracted values to create an instance of `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials` and return it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

# corrected function
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    
    # Define the get_authorization_scheme_param function to extract scheme and credentials
    def get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
        # Add your implementation to extract the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header
        pass
        
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

Please note that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function should be implemented to correctly extract the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header.
