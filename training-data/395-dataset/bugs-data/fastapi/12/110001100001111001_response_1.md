The potential error in the code is in the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function, which is used to extract the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header. The error occurs because the function is not correctly parsing the credentials for the Basic authentication scheme. It should be splitting the authorization header by the space and returning the second part as credentials.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function to correctly extract the credentials for the Basic authentication scheme.

Here's the corrected code with the fix:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

And the corrected `get_authorization_scheme_param` function:

```python
def get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    if not authorization:
        return None, None
    parts = authorization.split(" ")
    if len(parts) != 2:
        return None, None
    return parts[0], parts[1]
```

With this fix, the function should correctly parse the credentials for the Basic authentication scheme and avoid the bug.
