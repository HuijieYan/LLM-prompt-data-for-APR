The buggy function is a part of a class called HTTPBearer, which is likely responsible for handling HTTP Bearer token authentication. The function seems to be checking the 'Authorization' header in the incoming request to verify the credentials.

Based on the provided test case, it seems that the function is treating the 'Basic' authentication scheme as a bearer token. This is incorrect and results in the function raising an HTTPException with the message "Invalid authentication credentials".

To fix this bug, the function should correctly check for the "Bearer" scheme in the 'Authorization' header.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected code, the function first checks if the 'Authorization' header exists. If it does, it then extracts the scheme and credentials and validates that the scheme is "Bearer" before returning the authentication credentials. If any of these checks fail, it raises an HTTPException with the appropriate error message.
