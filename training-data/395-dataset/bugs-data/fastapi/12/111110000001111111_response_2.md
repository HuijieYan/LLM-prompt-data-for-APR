The problem with the provided function is that it is checking for the presence of both 'authorization' and 'scheme' before extracting the 'scheme' and 'credentials' from the 'authorization' header. This can lead to issues if 'authorization' is present but 'scheme' and 'credentials' are not.

To fix this issue, the function should first extract the 'scheme' and 'credentials' from the 'authorization' header, and then check for their presence.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
        )

    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In this corrected code, we first check for the presence of the 'Authorization' header. If it is not present, we handle it as per the value of 'self.auto_error'. If it is present, we then extract the 'scheme' and 'credentials' from it. After that, we check for the presence of both 'scheme' and 'credentials', and then proceed with the necessary checks and return the result.
