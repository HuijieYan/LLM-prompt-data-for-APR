Potential error location: The bug is likely in the condition `if scheme.lower() != "bearer"`. If the scheme is not "bearer", it raises an HTTPException with status code 403, which is causing the test to fail.

Reason behind the bug: The bug is occurring because when the authorization scheme is not "bearer", it immediately raises an HTTPException instead of returning None or handling the error differently.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The condition `if scheme.lower() != "bearer"` should be modified to accommodate the case where the scheme is not "bearer". Instead of raising an exception, it should return None or handle the error differently, based on the requirement.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization:
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
                )
            else:
                return None
        else:
            if scheme.lower() == "bearer":
                return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
            else:
                if self.auto_error:
                    raise HTTPException(
                        status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
                    )
                else:
                    return None
    else:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
```
