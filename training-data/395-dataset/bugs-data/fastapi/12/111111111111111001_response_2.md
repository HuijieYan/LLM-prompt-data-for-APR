The test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is testing for the response status code being 200, but it's currently returning 403, which is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if scheme.lower() != "bearer"`. It seems that the function is designed to handle "Bearer" as the scheme, but it's currently checking for "bearer" in lowercase.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is expecting the scheme to be "Bearer" with an uppercase "B", but the comparison is being done with the scheme in lowercase.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statement to convert the scheme to lowercase before comparison. We can also update the error message to be more descriptive.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication scheme. It should be 'Bearer'",
        )

    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
