The bug is located in the '__call__' method of the 'HTTPBearer' class. The '__call__' method is responsible for validating the 'Authorization' header and returning the credentials. 

The bug occurs because the method does not correctly handle the scenario where the authorization scheme is not 'bearer'. In the test function 'test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials()', the function is expected to return a status code of 200, but it actually returns a 403 status code, indicating that the authorization scheme is not being handled properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the '__call__' method to correctly handle the case where the authorization scheme is not 'bearer'. 

Here's the corrected code for the '__call__' method:

```python
# Corrected function source code
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":  # Updated condition to handle non-bearer schemes
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            else:
                return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we added an additional check to handle the scenario where the authorization scheme is not 'bearer'. If the scheme is not 'bearer', it will raise an HTTPException with status code 403 and the detail "Invalid authentication credentials". This ensures that non-bearer schemes are properly handled and return the correct status code.
