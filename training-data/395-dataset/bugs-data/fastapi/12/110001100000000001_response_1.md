Potential error location: The potential error is in the line `scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)`. The function `get_authorization_scheme_param` is being used but it is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Reason behind the bug: The error occurs because the function `get_authorization_scheme_param` is not defined or imported in the given code snippet. It seems like this function is supposed to extract the scheme and credentials from the authorization header, but it is missing from the provided code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is defined in another module or file, it needs to be imported into this file.
2. If the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is supposed to be a part of the current module, it needs to be defined and implemented within the module.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Import the necessary module if get_authorization_scheme_param is defined in another module
# from utils import get_authorization_scheme_param

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    
    # Assuming get_authorization_scheme_param is defined in the same module
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
