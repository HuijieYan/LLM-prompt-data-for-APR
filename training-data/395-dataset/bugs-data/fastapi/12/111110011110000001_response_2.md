Potential error location: The issue seems to be within the `HTTPBearer` class's `__call__` method. Specifically, the code is raising a `HTTPException` with a status code of `HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN` when the scheme in the authorization header is not "bearer". This behavior conflicts with the test case, which expects a 200 status code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is raising a `HTTPException` with a status code of `HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN` when the authorization scheme is not "bearer". This behavior does not match the expected behavior in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, modify the `__call__` method to return a proper response with a 403 status code when the scheme in the authorization header is not "bearer". This response should match the expected behavior in the test case.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Not authenticated",
                )
            else:
                return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
