The potential error in the buggy function is that it incorrectly handles the authorization header. When the scheme is "Basic" instead of "Bearer", it should raise an HTTPException, but it does not do so.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the "Basic" scheme and does not raise an HTTPException when it should.

To fix the bug, we need to add an additional condition to check for the "Basic" scheme and raise an HTTPException if it is found.

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    if scheme.lower() == "basic":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication scheme",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
