The error message indicates that the test case is expecting a status code of 200, but it received a status code of 403 instead. This suggests that there is an issue with the authentication process, specifically related to the scheme and credentials in the 'Authorization' header.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the scheme. The function is currently checking if the scheme is not "bearer" and raising an HTTPException with status code 403. This is likely the cause of the 403 status code being returned to the test case.

The bug is occurring because the function is incorrectly handling the authentication scheme. It raises an HTTPException with status code 403 if the scheme is not "bearer", even when it's "basic".

To fix the bug, the function needs to check for the correct scheme and return the appropriate response. If the scheme is not "bearer", it should return a response with status code 401 (unauthorized) rather than 403 (forbidden).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, the function will return a response with status code 401 if the scheme is not "bearer", indicating that the client needs to provide correct authentication credentials. This should align with the expectations of the test case.
