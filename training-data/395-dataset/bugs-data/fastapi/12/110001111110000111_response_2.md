The test case "test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials" is sending a request with an "Authorization" header using the "Basic" scheme, but the expected behavior is a 403 status code since the function only allows the "bearer" scheme.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statement checking for the "bearer" scheme. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly returning a 403 status code when the scheme is not "bearer", as requested by the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to return a 403 status code when the scheme is not "bearer".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
