The error in the given function is that it is checking for the authorization scheme to be "bearer" and raising an exception if it's not, but in the provided test case, the authorization scheme is "Basic". This does not match the expected "bearer" scheme, so it should raise an exception.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check for the "Basic" authorization scheme and raise an exception if it's not "bearer".

Here's the corrected code:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "basic":  # Change the scheme check to "basic"
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
