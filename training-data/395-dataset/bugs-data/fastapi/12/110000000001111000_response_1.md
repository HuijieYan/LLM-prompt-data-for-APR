```python
from fastapi import HTTPException
from fastapi.security import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials, HTTPBearer
from starlette.requests import Request
from typing import Optional

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=403, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
In the above code, I have renamed the `HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN` to `403` and fixed the import for `Request` and `HTTPBearer`. Also, note that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` is assumed to be a helper function that can properly extract the scheme and credentials from the Authorization header, which should be defined in the code.
