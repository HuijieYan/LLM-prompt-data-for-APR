Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur when the `scheme` variable is assigned the value of the entire `authorization` string, instead of just the scheme. This causes the comparison `scheme.lower() != "bearer"` to always be true, resulting in the "Invalid authentication credentials" error.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is not correctly separating the scheme and credentials from the authorization string.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a different method to extract the scheme and credentials from the authorization string.
2. Check the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function for any issues with parsing the authorization string.

Corrected Code:
```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = authorization.split(' ')
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
