The error message indicates that the test is expecting a status code of 200, but receiving 403 instead, which indicates a forbidden access. This suggests that the issue lies within the `HTTPBearer` class's `__call__` method which is supposed to handle the Authorization header.

Upon analysis, the issue seems to be in the following lines of code:
```python
if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
        detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
    )
```
The bug occurs because the code is checking if the scheme is lowercased "bearer", which is case-sensitive and won't match the capitalized "Basic" string provided in the test function.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by using the `lower()` function for both the scheme and the comparison string.

Here is the corrected code:
```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
