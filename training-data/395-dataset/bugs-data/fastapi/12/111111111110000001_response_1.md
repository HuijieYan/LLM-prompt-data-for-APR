The error message indicates that the test is expecting a status code of 200 but is receiving a status code of 403. This implies that the authentication is failing and returning a 403 status code instead of the expected 200.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for the scheme. It is checking if the scheme is not equal to "bearer" and raising a 403 status code. This is likely causing the authentication failure and the 403 status code being returned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when the scheme is not "bearer" properly. It is raising a 403 status code instead of handling it as an invalid authentication scheme.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for the scheme so that it properly handles the case of an invalid authentication scheme and does not immediately raise a 403 status code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
