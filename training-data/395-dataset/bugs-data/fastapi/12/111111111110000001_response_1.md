The error occurs when the test function is asserting that the response status code should be 200, but it is actually returning 403. This indicates that the authentication is failing and returning a 403 status code instead of the expected 200.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check for the scheme being "bearer" which should not reject the request since the header value is "Basic notreally".

The bug occurs in the comparison `scheme.lower() != "bearer"`. The comparison should not fail since the test header value is "Basic notreally" and not "Bearer".

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the conditional check for the scheme being "bearer" does not fail if the header value is not "Bearer".

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme and scheme.lower() == "bearer":
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    else:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
```
With this correction, the function will first check if the scheme exists and then compare it with "bearer". If it matches, it will return the credentials, otherwise, it will return an HTTP exception.
