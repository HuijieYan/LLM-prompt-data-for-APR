Potential error location: The issue is likely in the conditional statement that checks if the scheme is not 'bearer'. This conditional check is causing the function to raise an HTTPException with status_code 403, which leads to the test failure.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The function is checking the scheme in a case-sensitive manner. When the scheme is 'Basic' instead of 'bearer', the conditional statement is triggered and the function raises an HTTPException with status_code 403, which is not expected according to the test case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for the scheme to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting the scheme to lowercase and then performing the comparison.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":  # Fix: Convert scheme to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

After this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison for the scheme, which should resolve the issue and allow the test case to pass successfully.
