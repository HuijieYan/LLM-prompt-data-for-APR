The error is occurring because the function is checking if the authorization scheme is "bearer" and throwing an exception if it's not. However, in the given test case, the authorization scheme is "Basic", so the function should not throw an exception but instead return the credentials.

To fix this issue, we should remove the check for the authorization scheme and always return the credentials if they exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
