The bug in the provided code is that it is not checking for the "Basic" authentication scheme, which is causing it to raise an HTTPException for "Invalid authentication credentials" even though the scheme is "Basic" and the credentials are provided.

To fix this, the code needs to be modified to check for the "Basic" scheme and credentials and handle them appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional
from starlette.requests import Request
from fastapi import HTTPException
from fastapi.security.base import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from fastapi.security.utils import get_authorization_scheme_param
from starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() == "basic":
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    else:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
```
