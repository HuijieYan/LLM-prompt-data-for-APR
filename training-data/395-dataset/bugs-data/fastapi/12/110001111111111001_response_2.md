The error occurs when the test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is run. The test is expecting a status code of 200, but the actual status code returned is 403. This indicates that the authentication check within the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class is not functioning as expected.

The potential error location is within the conditional checks for the scheme and credentials. It is likely that the wrong condition is being evaluated, leading to the incorrect status code being returned.

The bug occurs because the `__call__` method is not handling the "Basic" authentication scheme correctly. Instead, it should focus on checking for "Bearer" authentication only. Additionally, the test case is expecting a 200 status code, indicating that the authentication should be successful, but the method is returning a 403 status code, which signifies a failed authentication.

To fix the bug, the method should be modified to only accept the "Bearer" authentication scheme. If the scheme is not "Bearer", it should raise an HTTPException with a status code of 403. If the scheme is "Bearer", it should return the HTTPAuthorizationCredentials.

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` method:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
