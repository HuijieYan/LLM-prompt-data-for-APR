The test case "test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials" is expecting the status code to be 200, but the actual status code is 403, which indicates that the authorization process is not working properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check on the scheme. It is currently checking for the "bearer" scheme, but in the test case, the authorization scheme is "Basic".

The bug occurred because the function only allows the "bearer" scheme and does not handle other schemes such as "Basic" properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle other authorization schemes besides "bearer". We can do this by checking if the scheme is "bearer" or not, and then returning the appropriate response based on the scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the "bearer" scheme, and if the scheme is not "bearer", we return an error response. This change will allow the function to handle other authorization schemes properly and fix the bug in the test case.
