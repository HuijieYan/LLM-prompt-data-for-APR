The potential error in the provided buggy function is that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is being used without being defined or imported. This function seems to be responsible for splitting the authorization header into its scheme and credentials.

The buggy function is encountering an error because it uses the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function, but this function is not defined or imported. Therefore, the function is not able to split the authorization header into its scheme and credentials, which leads to potential errors in the subsequent checks.

To fix this issue, the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function needs to be properly defined or imported so that the function can split the authorization header as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function, assuming the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is properly defined or imported:

```python
from starlette.requests import Request
from fastapi import HTTPException, HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
from fastapi.security.http import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = authorization.split(" ")  # Splitting the authorization header based on space
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, I have removed the usage of the undefined `get_authorization_scheme_param` function and replaced it with the built-in `split` method to split the authorization header into its scheme and credentials.
