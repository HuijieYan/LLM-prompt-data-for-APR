Potential error location: The potential error lies in the if condition `if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):`. 

Reason for the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of the `authorization` header, which may result in the `if not` condition always evaluating to true, even if the authorization header is provided. 

Possible approach for fixing the bug: It seems that the condition `if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):` is incorrect. Instead, it should check if either the `authorization` or `scheme` or `credentials` are missing. Additionally, it would be better to handle the case where the scheme is not 'bearer' without raising an exception if `auto_error` is set to `False`.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
