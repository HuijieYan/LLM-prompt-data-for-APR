Potential error location: The potential error in the code is within the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function that is used to parse the authorization string.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is not defined in the code provided, so it is causing a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Create the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function if it does not exist and ensure that it parses the authorization string correctly.
2. If the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is an external function, ensure that it is imported correctly.

Corrected code:
```python
from fastapi import HTTPException, Request
from fastapi.security.http import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
from fastapi.security.utils import get_authorization_scheme_param

# Assuming the get_authorization_scheme_param function exists and is correctly defined

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
In the corrected code, we assume that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is correctly defined and is accessible within the scope of the problematic function.
