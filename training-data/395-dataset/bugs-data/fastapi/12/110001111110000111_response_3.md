Potential error location: The potential error in the given code is in the `if scheme.lower() != "bearer":` condition. This condition is checking if the authentication scheme is not 'bearer', and if it isn't, it raises an HTTPException with a status code of 403.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
- The test function is expecting a status code of 200, but the buggy function is raising an HTTPException with a status code of 403 when the authentication scheme is not 'bearer'. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual status codes, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Instead of raising an HTTPException with a status code of 403 when the authentication scheme is not 'bearer', modify the function to return the appropriate response while ensuring it is correctly handled by the client code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication scheme"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
