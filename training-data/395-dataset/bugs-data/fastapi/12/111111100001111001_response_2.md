The potential error location within the problematic function is that it is checking for the scheme to be "bearer" regardless of whether the "Authorization" header starts with "Basic" or "Bearer".

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the case when the "Authorization" header starts with "Basic" instead of "Bearer". It should first check for the beginning of the authorization to see if it starts with "Bearer" or "Basic" and then proceed accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case when the authorization starts with "Basic" and return an appropriate error message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    parts = authorization.split(" ", 1)
    if len(parts) != 2:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    
    scheme, credentials = parts
    scheme = scheme.lower()
    if scheme != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this modification, the code will properly handle the case when the authorization starts with "Basic" and return the appropriate error message.
