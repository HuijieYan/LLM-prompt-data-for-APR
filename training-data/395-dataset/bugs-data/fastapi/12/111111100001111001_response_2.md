The potential error in the provided code is that the function is not handling the case when the 'Authorization' header is present, but the scheme is not 'bearer' or when the 'Authorization' header is missing.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when the 'Authorization' header contains a value other than 'bearer'. It only checks if the 'Authorization' and scheme are present, but it does not account for the possibility of other authentication schemes.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if the 'Authorization' header is present. If it is not present, we can return an error. If it is present, we can then check if the scheme is 'bearer' or not, and return an error if it is not.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
