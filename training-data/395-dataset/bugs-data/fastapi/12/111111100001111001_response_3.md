The potential error in the provided function is in the line `if scheme.lower() != "bearer":`. This line checks if the authentication scheme is not equal to "bearer", but the input values provided in the test case have the authentication scheme as "Basic", not "Bearer". This would cause the function to raise an HTTPException with the detail "Invalid authentication credentials".

To fix the bug, we need to remove or modify the line `if scheme.lower() != "bearer":` to properly handle the "Basic" authentication scheme.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer" and scheme.lower() != "basic":  # allow "Basic" authentication
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
