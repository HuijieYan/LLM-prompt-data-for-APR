The buggy function is meant to extract and validate the authorization credentials from the request headers. However, there are multiple issues in the implementation, leading to potential bugs.

The potential error location is within the conditional check for the presence of proper `authorization`, `scheme`, and `credentials`. The function does not handle the case where the Authorization header is of type 'Basic', which should not be the case for a Bearer token.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the scenario when the Authorization header is of type 'Basic' instead of 'Bearer'. Additionally, it does not handle the case when `scheme` is not 'bearer' as specified in the condition for checking the scheme.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the scheme is 'Bearer' and then extract the credentials. If the scheme is not 'Bearer' or the credentials are not present, it should raise an HTTPException. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer" or not credentials:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
