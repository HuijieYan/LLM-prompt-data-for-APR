The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition where it checks for the scheme type. The function checks if the scheme.lower() != "bearer" and if it is, it raises an HTTPException with status code 403. This is likely the cause of the test failing with a 403 status code error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is expecting the scheme to be "bearer" in lowercase, but the input header has a different scheme ("Basic") in lowercase.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle the "Basic" scheme in addition to the "Bearer" scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer" and scheme.lower() != "basic":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

By modifying the condition to check for both "bearer" and "basic" schemes, the function can handle both types of schemes and should now pass the test case with the correct status code.
