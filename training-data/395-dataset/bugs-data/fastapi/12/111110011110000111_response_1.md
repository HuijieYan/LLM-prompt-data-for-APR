The test case is checking for a status code of 200 when making a request to "/users/me" with an "Authorization" header set to "Basic notreally". However, the error message indicates that the actual status code received is 403.

The potential error in the buggy function is the check for the authentication scheme. The function should be expecting "Bearer" as the scheme, but it is currently checking for "Basic" as the scheme.

The bug occurs because the function is checking for the wrong authentication scheme. It expects "Bearer" as the scheme but is checking for "Basic", leading to the function returning a 403 status code instead of 200.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for the "Bearer" scheme instead of "Basic". Additionally, the function should return a 200 status code when the authentication credentials are found to be incorrect.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With these changes, the function will now correctly check for the "Bearer" authentication scheme and return a status code of 401 for unauthorized access.
