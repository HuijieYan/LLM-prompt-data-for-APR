Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `HTTPBearer` class's `__call__` method. The test function is trying to assert that the status code should be 200, but it is getting a 403 instead.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely caused by the `__call__` method in the `HTTPBearer` class always returning a status code of 403 for authentication errors, regardless of whether `auto_error` is set to True or False.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the `__call__` method should return a status code of 200 along with the appropriate message when `auto_error` is set to False.

Corrected code:

```python
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, the status code for authentication errors has been changed to HTTP 401 Unauthorized. Additionally, in the case where `auto_error` is False, the method returns None instead of raising an exception. This change ensures that the status code returned in the test will be 200 when `auto_error` is set to False.
