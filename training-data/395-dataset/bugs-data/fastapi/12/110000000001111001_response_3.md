The buggy function is the `__call__` method of a class, which is designed to process a request and extract authorization credentials from the request headers. The function then validates the credentials and returns an instance of HTTPAuthorizationCredentials if the credentials are valid. 

Based on the provided runtime values and types, the potential error location is within the processing of the 'Authorization' header to extract the scheme and credentials. 

The bug occurs because the current implementation incorrectly assumes that the 'Authorization' header always contains a valid "Bearer" token. This assumption leads to issues when the header contains a different authentication scheme, such as "Basic" in the provided test case.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle different authentication schemes and provide appropriate error messages or responses for invalid schemes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication scheme"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the 'Authorization' header exists. If not, it returns an appropriate error message or response based on the value of `self.auto_error`. Then, it extracts the scheme and credentials and performs the necessary validation, throwing an error or returning None if the authentication scheme is not "Bearer". Finally, it returns an instance of HTTPAuthorizationCredentials if the credentials are valid.
