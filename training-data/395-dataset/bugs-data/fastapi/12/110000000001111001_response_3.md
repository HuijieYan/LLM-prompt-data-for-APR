Potential error location: The bug seems to occur in the handling of the authorization credentials, specifically in parsing the authorization header and checking for the bearer token.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking for the bearer token without properly parsing the authorization header.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Parse the authorization header to extract the scheme and credentials separately.
2. Check if the authorization header exists and if it contains the "Bearer" scheme.
3. If the header does not exist or the scheme is not "Bearer", raise a 403 HTTP exception.
4. If the header and scheme are valid, return the extracted scheme and credentials as an instance of HTTPAuthorizationCredentials.

Corrected code:

```python
from starlette.datastructures import Headers
from fastapi import HTTPException, Request
from fastapi.security.http import HTTPBearer
from typing import Optional
from fastapi.security.http import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")

    # Parse the authorization header to extract the scheme and credentials
    if authorization:
        scheme, credentials = authorization.split(" ", 1)
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            # If the scheme is not "Bearer", raise a 403 HTTP exception
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=403,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
    else:
        # If the authorization header does not exist, raise a 403 HTTP exception
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="Not authenticated"
        )
    
    # If the authorization header and scheme are valid, return the extracted scheme and credentials
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
