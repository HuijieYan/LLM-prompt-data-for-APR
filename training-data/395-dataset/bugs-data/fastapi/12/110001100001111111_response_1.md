The issue in the provided function is that it only checks for the "bearer" scheme and throws an error for any other scheme, such as "Basic". However, based on the input provided, the scheme is "Basic" and it should not throw an error for this case.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the check for the "bearer" scheme and only check for the presence of the authorization and its credentials.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we first check for the presence of the "Authorization" header. If it is not present, it raises an error or returns None based on the value of `self.auto_error`. Then, we extract the scheme and credentials from the authorization header and return the `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials`.
