The potential error in the provided function is that it is checking for the 'bearer' scheme in the authorization header, but the input value contains the 'Basic' scheme instead.

The bug occurs because the function is expecting the authorization scheme to be 'Bearer', but the input value has the 'Basic' scheme. This causes the function to raise an `HTTPException` with the status code `HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN` and the detail "Invalid authentication credentials".

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check for the 'Basic' scheme as well and handle it accordingly without raising an exception.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer" and scheme.lower() != "basic":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, I rearranged the logic to first check if the authorization header exists. If it does not, it raises an exception or returns None based on the value of `self.auto_error`. Then it checks for the scheme and credentials and if they are not valid, it again raises an exception or returns None based on the value of `self.auto_error`. Finally, it checks if the scheme is either "bearer" or "basic" and returns the `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials` if it passes all checks.
