Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)` function, which is responsible for extracting the scheme and credentials from the authorization header. The bug may be related to how the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function handles the input authorization string.

Reason for the bug: The bug may be caused by the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function not properly extracting the scheme and credentials from the authorization header.

Possible approach to fix the bug: One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function correctly extracts the scheme and credentials from the authorization header. Additionally, the code should handle the case where the authorization header is not None but is not in the correct format.

```python
# Corrected function
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if scheme is None or credentials is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the authorization header is None. If it is, we handle it according to the `self.auto_error` condition. Then, we attempt to extract the scheme and credentials. If either of them is None, we handle it similarly. Finally, we check if the scheme is "bearer" and return the `HTTPAuthorizationCredentials` if it is. Otherwise, we raise an HTTPException.
