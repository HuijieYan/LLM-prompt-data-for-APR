The error message from the test function indicates that the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code is 403. This suggests that there is an issue with the authorization check in the `HTTPBearer` class.

The potential error location within the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class is the following condition:
```python
if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
```
This condition checks if the scheme is not equal to "bearer" in a case-insensitive manner. If the scheme is not "bearer", it raises an HTTPException with a status code of 403.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the authorization header in the test case has a scheme of "Basic" instead of "Bearer". This causes the condition to be true and raises the 403 error.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to handle the case when the scheme is not "bearer". Instead of raising an exception, it should return `None` if the scheme is not "bearer".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        return None
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
