Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the conditional checks for the authorization scheme and credentials.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking for the scheme "bearer" and invalidating the credentials if they do not match the scheme. In the provided test case, the scheme is "Basic" and the credentials are "notreally", which causes the function to raise a 403 HTTPException.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The function should first check if the scheme is "bearer" before validating the credentials. If the scheme is not "bearer", it should raise a 403 HTTPException. If the scheme is "bearer", then it should return the HTTPAuthorizationCredentials.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected code, the function checks if the scheme is "bearer" before validating the credentials. If the scheme is not "bearer", it raises a 403 HTTPException. If the scheme is "bearer", then it returns the HTTPAuthorizationCredentials. This should address the issue and make the test case pass.
