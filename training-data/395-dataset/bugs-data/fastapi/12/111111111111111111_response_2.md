The error occurs because the authentication scheme is not "Bearer" as expected by the buggy function. The buggy function does not handle this scenario properly and does not return the correct response status code or message.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the scheme and handle cases where the scheme is not "Bearer" by raising an HTTPException with the appropriate status code and message.
2. Update the test case to match the expected response status code and message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected function, it will properly handle the scenario where the scheme is not "Bearer" and return the appropriate response. The test case should also be updated to assert the correct status code and message based on the expected response.
