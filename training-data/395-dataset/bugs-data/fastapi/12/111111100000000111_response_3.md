The potential error in the provided code is that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is not defined within the scope of the given code. This could lead to a NameError or AttributeError when trying to execute the code.

To fix this issue, the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function needs to be defined or imported from another module.

Here's the corrected code with a placeholder for the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)

# Placeholder for the get_authorization_scheme_param function
def get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization: str):
    # Define or import the logic for extracting the scheme and credentials from the authorization header
    pass
```

In the corrected code, a placeholder for the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function has been added. Depending on the actual implementation of this function, it should be defined within the same module or imported from another module to ensure that the code runs without errors.
