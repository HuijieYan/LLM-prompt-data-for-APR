The error occurs because the buggy function is not handling the case where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" correctly. The function only checks if the authorization header is present and then assumes it is in the "bearer" format, which leads to the HTTP 403 error being raised in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the scheme is "bearer" before proceeding and raise an error if it's not. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
``` 

With this correction, the function first checks if the authorization header is present, then it checks if the scheme and credentials are present, and finally, it checks if the scheme is "bearer" before proceeding. This will ensure that the correct error is raised in case the authorization scheme is not "bearer".
