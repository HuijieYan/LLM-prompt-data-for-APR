The bug in the provided function is that it is checking for the bearer token in the Authorization header, but it is not handling the case when the token type is 'Basic'. The function should also check for the token type and handle it accordingly.

The potential error location is in the if condition where it checks for the scheme to be 'bearer' without considering the case when it is 'Basic'.

The bug occurred because the function only checked for the 'bearer' token and did not consider other token types.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check for the 'Basic' token type and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated")
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials")
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() == "bearer":
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    elif scheme.lower() == "basic":
        # Handle basic authentication here
        # Example: validate credentials and return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
        pass

    if self.auto_error:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials")
    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected code, I added a condition to check for the 'Basic' token type and handle it accordingly. If the token type is 'basic', you can validate the credentials and return the HTTPAuthorizationCredentials. Otherwise, it will raise an error for invalid authentication credentials.
