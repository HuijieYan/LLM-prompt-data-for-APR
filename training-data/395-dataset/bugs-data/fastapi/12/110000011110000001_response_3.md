The error message from the test function indicates that the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code is 403. This suggests that the authorization process is not working as expected and is returning a 403 error code when it should not be.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect handling of the "Authorization" header and the validation of the scheme and credentials.

The bug is occurring because the function is not checking for the correct scheme ("Bearer") in the Authorization header. Additionally, it should not return a 403 error if the authentication is not provided when it is defined as an "optional" bearer authentication.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the Authorization header and only return a 403 error if the provided credentials are invalid.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            return None
        else:
            return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme="", credentials="")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
