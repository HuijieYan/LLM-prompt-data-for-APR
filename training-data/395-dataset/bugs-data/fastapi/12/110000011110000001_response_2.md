The test case "test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials" is sending a request with an "Authorization" header that has the value "Basic notreally". The expected behavior according to the test is that the response status code should be 200, but it is actually 403.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the authorization scheme. The function is designed to only accept the "bearer" scheme, but the test case is sending the "Basic" scheme, hence triggering the 403 error response.

The bug occurred because the function is not properly handling cases where the authorization scheme is not "bearer". Instead of returning a proper error response, it directly raises an exception, causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle cases where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" by returning an HTTPException with the appropriate status code and detail message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function source code
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not scheme or scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this fix, the function now properly checks for the "bearer" scheme and returns the appropriate error response if the scheme is not as expected. This should address the bug and make the test case pass.
