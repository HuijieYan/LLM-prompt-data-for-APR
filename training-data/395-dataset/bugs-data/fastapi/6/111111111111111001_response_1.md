The bug occurs in the `request_body_to_args` function, specifically in the handling of list, set, and tuple types within the function. When the required parameters for the function include list, set, or tuple types and the received body is of form data type, the function incorrectly processes the data causing the assertions in the test cases to fail.

The reason behind the error is that the function does not handle the conversion of form data to the corresponding list, set, or tuple types properly. In the provided test cases, the form data is being sent with a list of items, but the function does not handle this correctly and produces an error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the conversion from form data to list, set, or tuple types based on the required parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from pydantic import ModelField, ErrorWrapper, FormData
from pydantic.fields import FieldInfo

def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: FormData,
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        field_info: FieldInfo = get_field_info(field)
        field_name = field.alias
        value = received_body.getlist(field_name) if field.shape in sequence_shapes else received_body.get(field_name)

        if value is None:
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field_name)))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
        else:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, loc=("body", field_name))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

This corrected code properly handles the conversion of form data to the corresponding list, set, or tuple types based on the required parameters.
