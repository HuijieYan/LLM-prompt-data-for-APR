The error message indicates that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200 for all the test functions provided. This indicates that there is an issue with the `request_body_to_args` function, which is responsible for processing the received body data.

The potential error location is within the section where the values from the received body are being processed and validated.

The possible reasons for the bug occurrence could be related to incorrect processing of the received body parameters, leading to invalid data being used for validation, which results in a 422 response status code.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the logic for processing of the received body parameters to ensure that the correct values are being extracted.
2. Verify the validation process, making sure that the values are validated using the correct rules and criteria.

Below is the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any, Union, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValueError, ErrorWrapper
from starlette.datastructures import FormData, UploadFile

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if isinstance(received_body, Dict):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(ValueError("Missing value"), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

It's important to ensure that the received body data is processed correctly and validated appropriately to avoid the occurrence of the 422 response status code.
