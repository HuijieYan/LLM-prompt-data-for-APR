The issue seems to be related to handling repeated keys in form data and validating them as a list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that handles values from form data.

The bug occurs because the current implementation only considers the last key=value pair when handling repeated keys in form data. This means that when a key appears multiple times in the form data, only the last occurrence is considered, leading to a loss of data and incorrect validation.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to properly handle repeated keys in form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This will ensure that all values for a repeated key are collected and validated as a list.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, Union
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.typing import sequence_shapes, FormData
from pydantic import ErrorWrapper
from copy import deepcopy
from fastapi import params
from starlette.datastructures import UploadFile
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            if received_body is not None:
                value: Any = None
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                # Handle repeated keys and assign values as a list
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) > 0:
                    value = [v[1] for v in value]
                if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                    # Handle other cases as before
                    # ...
                else:
                    if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                        contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                        value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

The corrected code includes modifications to properly handle repeated keys in form data and assign values as a list before validation. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub title and description.
