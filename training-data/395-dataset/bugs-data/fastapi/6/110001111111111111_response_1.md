The bug in the provided function `request_body_to_args` is related to handling repeated keys in form data. 

The function is expecting either a dictionary or form data as input and attempts to extract values based on the field aliases in the `required_params`. However, the current implementation is not able to handle cases where the form data contains repeated keys.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function in such a way that it handles repeated keys and collects their values into a list before validation.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, Union
from fastapi import UploadFile, Form, File
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.errors import ErrorWrapper, MissingError
from copy import deepcopy

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    
    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = None  # Initialize values with None
            
            if received_body is not None:
                # Extract values for the field alias
                if isinstance(received_body, dict):
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                elif isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    if field.shape in [0, 1]:  # Handle repeated keys
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        if len(value) == 1:
                            value = value[0]
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                        
                # Handle file uploads
                if isinstance(field.type_, type) and issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                    if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                        value = await value.read()
                    elif isinstance(value, list) and all(isinstance(v, UploadFile) for v in value):
                        value = [await v.read() for v in value]
                
                # Validate the value
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(exc=MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, we iterate through the `required_params` and extract values from the `received_body` based on the field alias. If the `received_body` is a FormData and the field shape is 0 or 1, we handle repeated keys by collecting their values into a list. We also handle file uploads and then validate the values.

By making these modifications, we ensure that the function properly handles repeated keys in form data and collects their values as lists before validation.
