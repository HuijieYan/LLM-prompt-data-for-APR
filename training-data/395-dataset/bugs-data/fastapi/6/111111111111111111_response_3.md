The bug occurs because the function `request_body_to_args` does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly. When multiple values for the same key are present in the form data, the function only captures the last value and does not handle them as a list, set, or tuple as expected.

To fix this bug, the function needs to modify its behavior to correctly capture and handle repeated keys in form data. It should process these repeated keys and their values as lists, sets, or tuples based on the field type.

The corrected code for the problematic function `request_body_to_args` is provided below:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, Union
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from fastapi.params import Form
from fastapi.encoders import sequence_shapes, sequence_types, sequence_shape_to_type
from fastapi import UploadFile
from copy import deepcopy
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper, MissingError
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and field.type_ in [list, set, tuple]:
                    if not isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                        value = [value]  # Convert to list if not already a list
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, we have added a condition to handle the case when `field.shape` is in `sequence_shapes` and the `field.type_` is a list, set, or tuple. If this condition is satisfied, and `value` is not already a sequence type, we convert it to a list. This way, repeated keys in form data will be handled as a list, set, or tuple based on the field type.

These changes should fix the bug and ensure that repeated keys in form data are handled correctly.
