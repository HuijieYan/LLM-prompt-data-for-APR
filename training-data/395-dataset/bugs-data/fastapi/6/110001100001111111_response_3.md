The bug in the provided function `request_body_to_args` is that it does not handle repeated keys in form data correctly. When receiving form data with repeated keys, it only captures the last value, which causes issues when validating the data, especially when the field type is a list, set, or tuple.

The bug occurs because the function does not account for repeated keys in the form data and does not handle them as lists, sets, or tuples as expected.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle repeated keys in the form data correctly. It should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list, set, or tuple to the same key before validation happens.

Below is the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any, Union, Optional
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.typing import FormData
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic import validator, ValidationError, BaseConfig
from pydantic import params


async def request_body_to_args(
        required_params: List[ModelField],
        received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_body = {field.alias: received_body.getlist(field.alias)}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in {params.Form.SEQUENCE, params.Form.SET, params.Form.SEQUENCE_SET} and isinstance(
                        received_body, FormData):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (value is None or
                    (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and
                     (field.shape in {params.Form.SET, params.Form.SEQUENCE_SET} and not value)) or
                    (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (field.shape in {params.Form.FILE, params.Form.UPLOAD_FILE} and
                    isinstance(value, UploadFile)):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (field.shape in {params.Form.SEQUENCE, params.Form.SEQUENCE_SET} and
                  isinstance(value, sequence_types)):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, the function has been modified to handle repeated keys in the form data correctly. It collects repeated keys and assigns those values as a list, set, or tuple to the same key before validation happens. Additionally, it also handles different field shapes appropriately for form data.
