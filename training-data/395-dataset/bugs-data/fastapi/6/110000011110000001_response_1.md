The error message in the test functions indicates that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200, which means the request is failing to process. This is likely due to an error in the `request_body_to_args` function, which is used to process the request body. The errors might occur when the function is trying to process Python lists, sets, or tuples as form data.

The potential error location within the function is in the block that processes the form data. It seems to be incorrectly handling form data with Python list, set, or tuple types.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to incorrect processing of form data with non-typing sequences such as lists, sets, or tuples.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve correcting the conditional statements and the handling of different types of non-typing sequences as form data.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                field_info = get_field_info(field)
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                if (
                    value is None
                    or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                    or (
                        isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                        and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                        and len(value) == 0
                    )
                ):
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                    continue
                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif (
                    field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
                ):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
