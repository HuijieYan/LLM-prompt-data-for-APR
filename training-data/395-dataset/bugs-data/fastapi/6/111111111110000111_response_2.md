The error seems to be related to the function `request_body_to_args`, which is responsible for converting request body data to arguments. It appears that the function is not handling repeated keys in the form data correctly, leading to a 422 status code (unprocessable entity) rather than the expected 200 status code.

The potential error within the function is likely related to how it processes repeated keys in form data. It seems that the function may be overwriting the earlier values of repeated keys with the last value, which is incorrect behavior.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not properly handling repeated keys in form data. Instead of collecting all the values associated with repeated keys and processing them as a list, it is currently only considering the last value.

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be modified to correctly handle repeated keys in form data. It should collect all the values associated with repeated keys and process them as a list or another suitable data structure to ensure that all the data is captured and processed accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional, Union
from pydantic import ModelField, FormData
from fastapi.params import params
from fastapi import UploadFile
import asyncio

async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is not None:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_
            else:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias)))
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected code, we process each field and correctly handle repeated keys in form data by collecting all the values associated with the key and processing them accordingly. Additionally, we have removed the unnecessary checks and refactored the code to improve readability and maintainability.
