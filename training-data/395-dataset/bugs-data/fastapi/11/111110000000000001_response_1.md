Potential error location: The error could be in the comparison of field.shape with Shape.SINGLETON, as well as in the condition checks of field.type_, sequence_types, and field.schema.

Reason behind the bug: The bug could be occurring due to incorrect comparison or incorrect conditions being checked in the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the field.shape is actually a singleton shape.
2. Check if the field.type_ is not a subclass of BaseModel.
3. Check if the field.type_ is not a subclass of any sequence types or a dictionary.
4. Check if the field.schema is not an instance of params.Body.

Corrected code:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not any(isinstance(field.type_, t) for t in sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
