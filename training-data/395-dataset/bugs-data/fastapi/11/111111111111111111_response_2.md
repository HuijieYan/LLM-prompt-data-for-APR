The bug occurs in the `is_scalar_field` function, where the validation logic for determining if a field is a scalar field is causing issues. The function is failing to correctly identify Union type fields and is incorrectly throwing ValidationErrors.

To fix this, the `is_scalar_field` function logic should be updated to correctly handle Union types and avoid unnecessary validation errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Union, Set
from pydantic.main import Field
from fastapi.params import Body

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not (
            isinstance(field.type_, typing._GenericAlias) and issubclass(field.type_.__origin__, Union)
        )
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Body)
        and not field.sub_fields
    )
```

This updated function uses `typing._GenericAlias` to check if a field's type is a Union, and also checks if there are no sub fields, ensuring that the field is indeed a scalar field.

Updating the `is_scalar_field` function with these modifications should resolve the issue of empty ValidationRequestErrors being thrown for Union type fields, and should accurately determine if a field is a scalar field.
