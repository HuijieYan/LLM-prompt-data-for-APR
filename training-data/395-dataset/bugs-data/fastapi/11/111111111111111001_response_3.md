The buggy function `is_scalar_field` appears to have an issue with the `field.schema` attribute. In the error messages from the test functions, a `KeyError` for a specific model type is encountered when trying to access `field_type.__pydantic_model__`. This implies that the model name map is not being populated correctly for the specific models.

The potential error is likely in the way the `model_name_map` is being populated or accessed within the `is_scalar_field` function. The issue arises when there are specific field types, such as `TypeVar` or `Enum` that may not be handled correctly in the computation of the schema.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `model_name_map` is properly populated with the relevant model types and their names. Additionally, the conditionals for handling different field types such as `TypeVar` or `Enum` should be reviewed to ensure they are being handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, (params.Body, Schema))  # Updated to include Schema
    )
```

In the corrected code, the check for `Schema` is added to the condition for `is_scalar_field`. This ensures that when accessing the `field.schema`, the correct type is considered. Additionally, the population of the `model_name_map` should be reviewed to ensure that it accounts for all the relevant model types being used.

It's important to thoroughly test the corrected function with relevant test cases to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
