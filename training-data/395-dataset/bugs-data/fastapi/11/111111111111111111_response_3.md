The bug is occurring in the function `is_scalar_field` in the provided code. The function is supposed to determine if a field is a scalar field based on certain conditions, but it seems to be causing errors when processing Union types, especially when used as request parameters.

The reason for the bug could be that the function `is_scalar_field` is not handling Union types properly, leading to the empty ValidationRequestError when Union types are used as parameters.

One approach to fix the bug could be to modify the `is_scalar_field` function to handle Union types correctly and ensure that it properly checks the conditions for determining if a field is a scalar field.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function based on the understanding of the bug:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, Shape
from pydantic.typing import AnyCallable, GenericAlias, TypeVar, Type, Any, Dict, Set, Tuple
from pydantic.schema import SkipField, validation_attribute_to_schema_keyword, field_type_schema, field_singleton_schema, field_singleton_sub_fields_schema, field_class_to_schema_enum_enabled, field_class_to_schema_enum_disabled
from pydantic.generics import GenericModel, Generic
from fastapi.params import Body

sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not isinstance(field.type_, GenericAlias)
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not any(issubclass(sub_field.type_, BaseModel) for sub_field in field.sub_fields)
        and not isinstance(field.model, Body)  # Assuming Body is a type in fastapi.params
    )
```

Note: Please replace `Body` with the actual definition of the `Body` type if it's different.

In the corrected code, the `is_scalar_field` function now properly handles Union types by checking if the `Field` type is a GenericAlias. It also correctly handles sub-fields within the Union type and ensures that the `Body` type from `fastapi.params` is handled as expected.
