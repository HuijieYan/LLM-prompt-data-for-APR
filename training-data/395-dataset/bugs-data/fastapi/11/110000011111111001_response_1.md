The error seems to be occurring inside the `is_scalar_field` function when checking the condition `not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)`. The error messages seem to indicate key errors, and looking at the test cases and the function definition, it seems that `field.schema` should be an instance of `pydantic.BaseModel`.

The bug is likely due to a missing import for the `params.Body` class, and the incorrect check for the class of `field.schema`.

To fix this bug:
1. Import the `pydantic.BaseModel` class if it's not already imported.
2. Change the check for `field.schema` to check if it's an instance of `pydantic.BaseModel` instead of `params.Body`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, BaseModel)
    )
```
