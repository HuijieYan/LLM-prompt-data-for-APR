The error message indicates that there are issues with the "field_singleton_schema" function which is a part of the Pydantic library. It seems that the "field_singleton_schema" function is not able to handle some of the types or fields provided to it, which is causing KeyErrors. This could be due to incorrect handling of types or type lookup.

Given that the error is occurring in the Pydantic library, the potential bug lies within the Pydantic library's implementation of the "field_singleton_schema" function.

To fix the bug, it would be best to update the Pydantic library to the latest version as this will likely address any existing bugs in the library. If the bug persists even after updating to the latest version, then it might be helpful to check for any reported issues or bugs related to the Pydantic library on its GitHub repository. You can also consider raising an issue on the Pydantic repository so that the maintainers of the library can investigate and fix the issue.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

As this is a part of the third-party library, it should ideally be updated through the library's own update mechanism, or through a community-driven fix provided by the maintainers of the library.
