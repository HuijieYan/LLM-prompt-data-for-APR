The issue in the code seems to stem from the `is_scalar_field` function, as indicated by the error messages and the expected variable values and types. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the `field` parameter. It checks for various conditions related to the `field` object, such as the `shape`, `type_`, and `schema`. However, based on the error messages and expected values, it appears that the function might be incorrectly handling certain types and attributes of the `field` object.

The `KeyError` in the error messages suggests that the `model_name_map` is missing entries, resulting in a lookup failure. This could be due to the incorrect handling of types or models in the `field` object.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function needs to be modified to correctly handle different types of fields and their attributes. It should ensure that the `model_name_map` is properly populated and that the lookup does not result in a `KeyError`. Additionally, the function should correctly evaluate the conditions related to the `shape`, `type_`, and `schema` of the `field` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel, sequence_types, Shape
from fastapi.params import Body


def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not (isinstance(field.type_, type) and issubclass(field.type_.__origin__, sequence_types))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Body)
    )
```

In this corrected code:
- We have used the `issubclass` method to check if the field's type is a subclass of `BaseModel`.
- For types using generics (like `Union`), we check if the `__origin__` of the type qualifies as a sequence type.
- We correctly check if the field's schema is an instance of `Body`.

By using these checks and methods, we ensure that the `is_scalar_field` function correctly evaluates the conditions related to the `field` object and the `model_name_map` lookup doesn't result in a `KeyError`.
