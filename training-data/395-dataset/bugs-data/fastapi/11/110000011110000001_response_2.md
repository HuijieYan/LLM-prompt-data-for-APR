The error is occurring within the is_scalar_field function due to the KeyError in the model_name_map dictionary.

The is_scalar_field function seems to be checking if a field is a scalar field based on certain conditions related to the field's shape, type, and schema. The bug is likely caused by an incorrect interaction between the type field and the model_name_map dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the model_name_map dictionary is populated with the correct mappings for each field type.

Here's the corrected is_scalar_field function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and field.type_ not in model_name_map  # Ensure the field type exists in the model_name_map
    )
```

In this corrected version, we've added a condition to ensure that the field's type is not present in the model_name_map, indicating that it's not a valid scalar field.

Additionally, it's important to review the model_name_map dictionary to ensure that it contains the correct mappings for field types. If there are discrepancies, the model_name_map should be updated accordingly based on the application's requirements.
