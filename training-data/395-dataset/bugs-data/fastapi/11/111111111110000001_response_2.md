The error messages indicate issues related to missing required arguments and KeyError. This suggests that there might be problems with the way the function is accessing certain values or fields.

The potential error location in the provided function is the line:
```python
model_name = model_name_map[field_type]
```

The KeyError indicates that the field_type being used as a key in the model_name_map does not exist.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely to be an incorrect or missing entry in the model_name_map.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the model_name_map to ensure that all the necessary classes/types are correctly added to the dictionary.
2. Handle the KeyError exception by providing a default value for cases where the field_type is not found in the model_name_map.

Corrected code for the problematic function `is_scalar_field`:
```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel) and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,)):
        if isinstance(field.schema, params.Body):
            return False
        try:
            model_name = model_name_map[field.type_]  # Assuming that model_name_map is a global variable
        except KeyError:
            return False  # Handle the KeyError exception by returning False if field type is not found
        return True
    return False
```
