Potential error location: 
The lenient_issubclass and sequence_types functions are not defined within the given code, which will cause a NameError when the function is called.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The lenient_issubclass and sequence_types functions are not defined, which is causing the NameError. These functions are being used to check if the field type is a subclass of BaseModel or a sequence type, but they are not imported or defined within the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary functions (lenient_issubclass, sequence_types) or classes (BaseModel, params.Body) from their respective modules.
2. Define the lenient_issubclass and sequence_types functions within the code if they are custom functions.
3. Handle any potential errors or exceptions caused by missing imports or definitions.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, sequence_types, params

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == 0  # Assuming Shape.SINGLETON represents 0
        and not isinstance(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not any(isinstance(field.type_, t) for t in sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
