The error `TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'model'` is occurring while attempting to run the test cases for the provided buggy function. 

Upon inspection of the provided function `is_scalar_field`, it seems that the issue likely lies in the usage of the `model_name_map` dictionary. The error `KeyError: <class 'tests.test_union_inherited_body.ExtendedItem'>` suggests that the function is trying to lookup a key within the `model_name_map` using a class that is not present as a key in the `model_name_map` dictionary.

To fix the bug, the `model_name_map` dictionary should be updated to include the missing class keys, in this case, `OtherItem` and `ExtendedItem`. This should resolve the KeyError that is occurring when the function is trying to retrieve the model names from `model_name_map`.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and field.type_ in model_name_map  # Make sure the class is present in the model_name_map
    )
```
