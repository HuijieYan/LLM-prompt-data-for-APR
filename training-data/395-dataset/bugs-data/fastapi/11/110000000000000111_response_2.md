Potential Error Location:
The is_scalar_field function is likely not handling Union types properly, leading to the empty validation error when request parameters are of Union type.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The is_scalar_field function does not account for Union types when checking the field type, which leads to the empty validation error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the is_scalar_field function to handle Union types correctly.
2. Update the implementation to handle Union types as a valid scalar field.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.type_, Union)
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

The corrected code includes a check for Union types in the is_scalar_field function, ensuring that Union types are not considered as scalar fields. This update should address the empty validation error when request parameters are of Union type.
