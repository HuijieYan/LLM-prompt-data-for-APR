Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is occurring due to the handling of Union types in the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is not properly handling Union types, which leads to validation errors during request processing.

The bug seems to be related to the `field.type_` not being handled correctly when it is a Union type. This leads to incorrect validation errors and results in the missing 1 required positional argument: 'model' error during request processing.

To fix the issue, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to properly handle Union types and avoid the incorrect validation errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if hasattr(field.type_, "__origin__") and field.type_.__origin__ == Union:
        # Handle Union types
        return all(is_scalar_field(Field(type_=sub_type)) for sub_type in field.type_.__args__)
    else:
        return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        )
```

In this updated function, Union types are properly handled by recursively checking each sub-type within the Union. If all sub-types are considered scalar fields, then the Union type as a whole is considered a scalar field.

With this update, the `is_scalar_field` function should now handle Union types correctly and prevent the validation errors from occurring during request processing.
