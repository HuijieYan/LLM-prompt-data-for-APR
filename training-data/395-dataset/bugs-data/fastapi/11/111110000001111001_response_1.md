The buggy function `is_scalar_field` is designed to check if a given field is a scalar field. However, it seems to have multiple issues such as using undefined variables like `lenient_issubclass` which are not provided in the code snippet, and it's unclear how the `params.Body` class is defined and being used.

The bug may be occurring due to the undefined variable `lenient_issubclass`, and the condition `not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)` is unclear.

To fix the function, I will assume that the intention is to check if the field is a scalar field based on the provided input parameters. Below is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Union, Any

class Field:
    # Assume that the Field class has the 'shape' and 'type_' attributes
    def __init__(self, shape: Any, type_: Any, schema: Any):
        self.shape = shape
        self.type_ = type_
        self.schema = schema

class Shape:
    # Assume that the Shape class has the 'SINGLETON' attribute
    SINGLETON = 1

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not isinstance(field.type_, (list, dict, tuple))  # Update this condition based on the intent
        and field.schema.__class__.__name__ != "Body"  # Assuming 'Body' is a class with __class__.__name__ attribute
    ):
        return True
    return False
```

In this corrected version, I used `isinstance` to check if the field type is a list, dictionary, or tuple, assuming these are the types that should not be considered scalar. I also used the assumption that the `Body` class has a `__class__.__name__` attribute to compare against.

It's important to note that the code may need further adjustments based on the actual definitions of the classes and their attributes, as well as the specific conditions for determining scalar fields.
