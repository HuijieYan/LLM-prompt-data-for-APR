The error occurs in the `is_scalar_field` function because it is not handling the input parameters correctly. The function seems to be validating whether a given field is a scalar field based on various attributes of the field. However, the comparisons and conditions in the function are not handling all the cases properly which leads to errors as observed in the test cases.

The bug occurs because the conditions in the `is_scalar_field` function are not comprehensive enough to handle the different types of fields and their attributes, resulting in KeyError and TypeError when trying to access attributes and dictionaries based on the field type.

To fix the bug:
- Add checks for different types of fields, including the consideration of `field.shape`, `field.type_`, and `field.schema`.
- Ensure that each attribute of the `field` object is accessed safely by checking for its existence before trying to access it directly.

Here's the corrected `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)  # Assuming lenient_issubclass is a valid function
        and not (isinstance(field.type_, _GenericAlias) and (Any in field.type_.__args__))  # Check for Any type
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)  # Assuming isinstance is a valid function
    )
```

In this corrected version, additional type checks and conditional checks have been added to handle a wider range of field types and their attributes, reducing the likelihood of KeyError and TypeError. However, please note that some assumptions have been made regarding the `lenient_issubclass` and `isinstance` functions since their implementations were not provided. Therefore, the correctness of the corrected code is subject to those assumptions.
