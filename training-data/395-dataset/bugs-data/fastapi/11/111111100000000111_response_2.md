Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be related to the way the `is_scalar_field` function checks for the field shape and type. The bug might be occurring because the function does not properly handle Union types and other complex types.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `is_scalar_field` function does not handle Union types properly. This results in the empty ValidationRequestError being thrown when a route method is called with Union type parameters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `is_scalar_field` function to properly handle Union types and other complex types by checking for these types explicitly.
2. Use the correct validation methods for Union types when checking if the parameters from the request are resolved and parsed against the types inside Union.
3. Ensure that the function takes into account the complexity of Union types and other similar complex types when determining if a field is scalar.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    from pydantic.main import BaseModel
    from fastapi.params import Body

    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not isinstance(field.type_, Union)
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Body)
    )
```
