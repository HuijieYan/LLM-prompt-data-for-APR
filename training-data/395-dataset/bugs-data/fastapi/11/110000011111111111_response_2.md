Analysis:
The bug seems to be in the `is_scalar_field` function, probably due to incorrect validation checks. The error message in the test functions indicates issues with validation and missing required positional arguments, which suggests that the function is not correctly handling the Union type for the input parameters.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The `is_scalar_field` function does not handle Union types correctly for validation checks.
2. It may not be checking for required attributes within Union types properly.

Possible approaches:
1. Update the `is_scalar_field` function to correctly handle Union types by checking the attributes of each type within the Union.
2. Ensure that required attributes are properly validated for each type within the Union.

Corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` method:
```python
from typing import Type, Any, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fastapi import params
from pydantic.fields import Field
from pydantic.schema import Shape
from pydantic.typing import AnyCallable

def is_scalar_field(field: Any) -> bool:
    if hasattr(field, 'sub_fields'):
        # If it's a Union type, iterate through the subfields and perform validations
        for subfield in field.sub_fields:
            if is_scalar_field(subfield):
                return True
        return False
    else:
        # Perform your custom validations here
        return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (list, dict))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        )

# Additional function for type checking
def lenient_issubclass(klass: Type, classinfo: Union[Type, tuple]) -> bool:
    return issubclass(klass, classinfo)

# Additional function to check if the type is a callable type
def is_callable_type(type_: Type) -> bool:
    return isinstance(type_, AnyCallable)
```

The corrected code introduces a recursive check for Union types, iterating through the subfields and performing validations for each type within the Union. It also includes the necessary checks for required attributes and type validations. Additionally, two additional utility functions have been added for type checking.
