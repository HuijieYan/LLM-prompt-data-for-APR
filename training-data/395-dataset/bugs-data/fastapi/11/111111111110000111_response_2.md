The error seems to be occurring in the `field_singleton_schema` function within the `pydantic/schema.py` file. The bug is likely happening because the function is unable to find the model name for the given field type, resulting in a KeyError.

It appears that the `field_singleton_schema` function is unable to handle Union types properly, leading to the empty ValidationRequestError being thrown.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `field_singleton_schema` function to properly handle Union types and retrieve the model name for the field type.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not any(lenient_issubclass(subfield.type_, BaseModel) for subfield in field.sub_fields)
        and not any(lenient_issubclass(subfield.type_, sequence_types + (dict,)) for subfield in field.sub_fields)
        and not any(isinstance(subfield.schema, params.Body) for subfield in field.sub_fields)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `is_scalar_field` function now properly checks if any subfield of the given field has a type that is a subclass of BaseModel, sequence types, or is an instance of params.Body. This should resolve the issue with the Union types in the original function.
