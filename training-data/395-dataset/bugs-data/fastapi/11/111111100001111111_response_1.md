The issue seems to be related to the handling of Union types in the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is not correctly handling the Union type and is leading to the empty ValidationRequestError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)`. This condition does not handle Union types properly.

The bug occurs because the `is_scalar_field` function does not handle Union types correctly. When a field is of Union type, the function should consider it as a scalar field if all the types within the Union are scalar, instead of trying to directly compare the Union type with BaseModel or other types.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the `is_scalar_field` function to handle Union type fields properly. It should check all the types within the Union and consider the field as a scalar field if all the types are scalar.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if getattr(field.type_, "__origin__", None) == Union:
        # If the field type is Union, check all types within the Union
        types_within_union = field.type_.__args__
        return all(
            not lenient_issubclass(type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            for type_ in types_within_union
        )
    else:
        return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        )
```

With this modification, the `is_scalar_field` function will correctly handle Union types and consider a field as a scalar field if all the types within the Union are scalar. This should resolve the issue with empty ValidationRequestError when request parameters are of Union type.
