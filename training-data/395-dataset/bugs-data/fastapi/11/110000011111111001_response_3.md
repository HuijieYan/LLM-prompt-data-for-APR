The error occurs in the `is_scalar_field` function due to the way it checks if the field meets specific criteria. The function has several conditions to determine if a field is a scalar field, but the logic is not entirely accurate. The conditions are checks for `field.shape`, `field.type_`, `field.schema`, and `field.sub_fields`.

The buggy function has wrong conditions because it's not checking the `field` attributes correctly. For example:
- The first condition checks `field.shape` against `Shape.SINGLETON`, but the expected type for `field.shape` is `Union[int, str]` and not `Shape` enum.
- Checking `field.type_` and `field.schema` also seems to be incorrect because the actual values and types are different than what's being checked in the function.

To fix the issue, we should modify the conditions to compare the correct attributes and values to determine if a field is a scalar field.

The corrected `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape in {1, 'SINGLETON'}
        and not getattr(field.type_, "__args__", ())
        and not getattr(field.schema, "__class__", None) == params.Body
        and field.sub_fields == []
    )
```
