The buggy function `is_scalar_field` is part of the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_11/fastapi/dependencies/utils.py`. It seems to be a part of a larger codebase using FastAPI. The function is used to check if a given field is a scalar field. The error message from the test functions indicates that an exception of type `KeyError` is being raised from this function, specifically when the `model_name_map` does not contain an entry for a certain field type.

Looking at the function, it seems that the line causing the issue is:
```python
model_name = model_name_map[field_type]
```
Here, it seems that the `model_name_map` does not have an entry for the `field_type`, and hence it raises a `KeyError`.

The reason for the occurrence of this bug can be that the `model_name_map` does not have an entry for the particular `field_type` used in the test cases.

One approach to fixing this bug would be to ensure that the `model_name_map` contains an entry for all possible `field_type` that could be encountered. This might involve updating the `model_name_map` to include entries for the missing types.

Here's a possible fix:

```python
from typing import Dict, Type

def is_scalar_field(field: Field, model_name_map: Dict[Type['BaseModel'], str]) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and model_name_map.get(field.type_)
    )
```
In this fix, the `model_name_map` is passed explicitly as an argument to the `is_scalar_field` function, and it's checked if the `model_name_map` contains an entry for the `field.type_` before attempting to access it. This helps prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.
