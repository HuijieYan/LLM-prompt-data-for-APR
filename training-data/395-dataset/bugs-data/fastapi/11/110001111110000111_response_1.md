The error is occurring when validating the parameters of a request against a Union type defined in the FastAPI route. The bug is likely in the validation process for Union types where the validation fails to correctly handle the case when one of the types of the Union is satisfied.

The bug is caused due to a validation error occurring when the request parameters are of Union type. It seems that there is an issue with the validation process for Union types which causes an empty ValidationRequestError to be thrown.

To fix the bug, the validation process for Union types needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when one of the types of the Union is satisfied.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Type

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and not isinstance(field.type_, List)  # Check if the field type is not a List
        and not isinstance(field.type_, TypeVar)  # Check if the field type is not a TypeVar
    )
```

In this corrected function, additional checks are added to ensure that the field type is not a List or a TypeVar, which are common types used within Union types. By adding these checks, the function will properly handle Union types in the validation process.
