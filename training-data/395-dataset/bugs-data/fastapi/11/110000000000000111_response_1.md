The bug in the provided function `is_scalar_field` is not directly related to the GitHub issue titled "Empty validation error when request parameters are of Union type". The bug seems to be related to the function that checks whether a given field is a scalar field.

The bug in the `is_scalar_field` function is that it incorrectly checks the conditions for a field to be considered a scalar field. The bug could potentially lead to incorrect validation of the field type within a Union type, which may be related to the GitHub issue mentioned.

To fix the bug in the `is_scalar_field` function, the following corrections can be made:

1. Use `field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON` to check if the field shape is a singleton.
2. Use `issubclass` to check if the field type is a subclass of `BaseModel`.
3. Use `isinstance` to check if the field type is an instance of sequence types or a dictionary.
4. Check if field.schema is an instance of `params.Body` to handle the Union type correctly.

Here's the corrected `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Type, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, params

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Field.Shape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not isinstance(field.type_, (list, tuple, set, dict))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, (params.Body, Union))
    )
```

This corrected function should address the bug and provide accurate validation for checking if a given field is a scalar field.
