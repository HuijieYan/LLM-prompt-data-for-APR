The bug in the `is_scalar_field` function seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of Union type fields. When the input field is of a Union type, the current implementation is unable to correctly validate and process the field.

To address this issue, the function needs to be updated to properly handle Union type fields. This can be done by checking if the field type is a Union and then iterating through each type within the Union to perform the necessary validation.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if hasattr(field.type_, '__origin__') and field.type_.__origin__ is Union:
        # If the field type is a Union, iterate through each type and perform the necessary validation
        for type_ in field.type_.__args__:
            if lenient_issubclass(type_, BaseModel) or lenient_issubclass(type_, sequence_types + (dict,)) or isinstance(field.schema, params.Body):
                return False  # If any of the types fail the validation, return False
        return True  # If all types pass the validation, return True
    else:
        return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        )
```

In this updated implementation, if the field type is a Union, it iterates through each type within the Union and checks if any of the types fail the validation. If any type fails the validation, it returns False. Only if all types within the Union pass the validation, it returns True.

This approach should address the issue of empty ValidationRequestError being thrown when request parameters are of Union type.
