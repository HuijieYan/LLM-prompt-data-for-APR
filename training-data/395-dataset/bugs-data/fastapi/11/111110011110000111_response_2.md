The bug is occurring in the `is_scalar_field` function which takes a `Field` as input and returns a boolean value. The error seems to be related to the usage of `model_name_map[field_type]` in the `field_singleton_schema` function. This suggests that the issue might be related to the mapping of field types to model names.

Possible reasons behind the bug:
- The `field_type` might not be correctly mapped to its corresponding `model_name` in the `model_name_map`.
- An incorrect type might be used as a key while accessing the `model_name_map`.
- There might be a mismatch between the field types and the model names in the `model_name_map`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Ensure that the `model_name_map` is correctly populated with the appropriate mappings of field types to model names.
- Verify that the types used as keys in the `model_name_map` match the actual types of the field.
- Double check the mappings to ensure that there are no mismatched or missing entries in the `model_name_map`.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, params, sequence, typing

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)
    return (
        field.shape == Field.Shape.SINGLETON
        and not typing.lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not typing.lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

In this corrected function, the type hints and imports have been updated to use the correct modules and classes. Additionally, the imported `typing` module has been used to access the `lenient_issubclass` function.
