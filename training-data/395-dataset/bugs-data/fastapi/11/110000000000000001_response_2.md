Potential error location: The error may be in the condition for checking if the field.type_ is a subclass of a BaseModel.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be occurring because the lenient_issubclass method is not handling the subclass check for BaseModel correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to modify the condition for checking if field.type_ is a subclass of BaseModel. We can use the issubclass method to correctly check for subclass relationships.

Corrected code:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
