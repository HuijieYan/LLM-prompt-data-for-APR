Potential Error Location: The `is_scalar_field` function is likely failing to properly handle Union types as the request parameters.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `is_scalar_field` function is not designed to handle Union types, leading to the empty ValidationRequestError when request parameters are of Union type.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `is_scalar_field` function to handle Union types properly, possibly by checking for Union types in the `field.type_` and taking appropriate action.
- Update the condition in the `is_scalar_field` function to consider Union types and handle them accordingly.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, (params.Body, Union))
    )
```
