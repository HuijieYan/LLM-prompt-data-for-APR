The potential error in the function is that the variable `sequence_types` is not defined in the function or imported from anywhere.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `sequence_types` is being used in the conditional check without being defined anywhere in the function.

To fix the bug, we need to define `sequence_types` or import it from a module where it is defined. Then we can use it in the conditional check.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_11/fastapi/dependencies/utils.py

from typing import Any, Type, Union
from fastapi.params import Body
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, Schema
from pydantic.typing import ForwardRef, display_as_type, lenient_issubclass, prepare_config
from pydantic.typing import (
    Display, ForwardRefT, List, Path, Primitive, SchemaExtraTyped, Tuple
)

sequence_types = (List, Tuple)

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, SchemaExtraTyped)
    )
```
