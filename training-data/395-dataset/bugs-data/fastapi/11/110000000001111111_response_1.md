The issue seems to be related to handling Union types in request parameters in FastAPI. The bug occurs when a request parameter is defined as a Union type and the route method is called with a valid payload. The bug results in an empty ValidationRequestError being thrown with a message value_error.missing, even though all parameters are valid.

The bug is likely occurring in the `is_scalar_field` function, where it is not properly handling Union types in the request parameters.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function needs to be updated to properly handle Union types in the request parameters and validate the fields accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from fastapi.params import Body

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not (hasattr(field.type_, "__origin__") and field.type_.__origin__ is Union)
        and not isinstance(field.schema, (params.Body, params.Query, params.Path, params.Form, params.Header, params.Cookie))
    )
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check for Union types in the `type_` attribute of the `field`. We check if the `type_` has an `__origin__` attribute and if it is of type `Union`. If so, we consider it as a non-scalar field and return False.

This correction should resolve the issue with handling Union types in the request parameters and prevent the empty ValidationRequestError from being thrown.
