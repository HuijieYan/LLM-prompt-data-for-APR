Potential error: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect logic in the is_scalar_field function, where it is not correctly determining if the field is a scalar field.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be occurring because the function logic is not properly checking for scalar fields. It may be failing to properly identify scalar fields due to incorrect condition checks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by reviewing and correcting the logic of the is_scalar_field function to properly identify scalar fields based on their characteristics such as shape, type, and schema.

Corrected code:

```python
from fastapi import Field, Body
from pydantic import BaseModel, sequence_types
from enum import Enum

class Shape(Enum):
    SINGLETON = "singleton"

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.field_info, Body)
    )
```
