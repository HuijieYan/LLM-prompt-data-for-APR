The bug occurs in the is_scalar_field function. This function is likely used to determine if a given field is a scalar type or not, based on the provided Field object. The error message from the test functions shows KeyError and TypeError, indicating that the function is not handling the input Field object correctly, which leads to validation errors.

To fix the bug, the is_scalar_field function should be updated to correctly handle the Field object and make the necessary checks to determine if the field is a scalar type or not.

Here's the corrected is_scalar_field function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator
from pydantic.typing import Type
from typing import Any

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == FieldShape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not (isinstance(field.type_, (list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict)))
        and not getattr(field, 'schema', None)  # Check if schema is present
    )
```
In this updated function, we use the FieldShape.SINGLETON (assuming it's an enum-like object) instead of Shape.SINGLETON to check the shape of the field. We also use issubclass to properly check for inheritance from BaseModel, and we check for the absence of sequence or mapping types for the field's type. Additionally, we ensure that the 'schema' attribute is present before checking it.

These changes should address the issues causing the KeyError and TypeError in the test functions and provide a more accurate determination of whether the field is a scalar type.

After making these changes, the test functions should be re-run to ensure that the validation errors no longer occur.
