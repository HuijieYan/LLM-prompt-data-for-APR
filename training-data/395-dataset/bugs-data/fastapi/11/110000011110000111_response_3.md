The error seems to be occurring in the function `is_scalar_field` in the provided code. The error messages indicate issues with field schema generation and the handling of Union types causing empty validation errors. 

Upon analyzing the code, the function `is_scalar_field` seems to be trying to determine if a given field is a scalar type by checking its shape, type, and schema. However, the current implementation of the function seems to be causing issues in correctly identifying the field type and schema.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the logic to handle Union types and their schemas more effectively.
2. Check for Union types and appropriately handle their schemas to avoid empty ValidationRequestError.
3. Ensure that the function correctly identifies scalar fields based on their type and schema.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel
from typing import Type, Any
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.schema import field_schema

def is_scalar_field(field: ModelField) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Field.SINGLETON
        and field.sub_fields is None
    )

```

In this corrected code, the `is_scalar_field` function now checks if the field is of shape SINGLETON and does not have any sub_fields, indicating a scalar type. This should help in correctly identifying scalar fields and avoiding the empty ValidationRequestError associated with parsing Union types.
