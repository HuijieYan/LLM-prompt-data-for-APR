Potential error location: The condition checking for `field.schema` to not be an instance of `params.Body` is not considering the case when the `field.schema` is an instance of `params.Body` and should return `True`.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The condition checking for `field.schema` is using `not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)` which would return `False` when `field.schema` is an instance of `params.Body`. However, the code should return `True` when `field.schema` is an instance of `params.Body`.

Approach for fixing the bug: Change the condition to explicitly check for `field.schema` to be an instance of `params.Body` and return `True` if the condition is met.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, _GenericAlias
from fastapi import Query
from starlette.datastructures import URL, FormData, Headers
from fastapi.params import Body

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
