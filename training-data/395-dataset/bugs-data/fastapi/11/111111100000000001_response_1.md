Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the condition `field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON`, as well as in the use of `lenient_issubclass()`.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The condition `field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON` might not be working as intended due to incorrect comparison or mismatch in the values of `field.shape` and `Shape.SINGLETON`.
2. There might be an issue with the usage of `lenient_issubclass()` function, leading to incorrect evaluation of the field type.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the definition and assignment of `Shape.SINGLETON`, and ensure that it matches the expected value.
2. Review the `lenient_issubclass()` function to ensure it correctly checks for subclass relationships.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Any
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel, params
from fastapi.params import Body
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import lenient_issubclass, sequence_types

def is_scalar_field(field: Field[Any]) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Field.Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
