The bug is likely occurring in the `is_scalar_field` function within the `utils.py` file. The function is designed to check if a `field` is a scalar field, and it includes checks for the field's shape, type, and schema. However, it does not account for the scenario where the field is a Union type, which could lead to the empty ValidationRequestError being thrown.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to handle the Union type scenario. It should check if the field's type is a Union and handle it accordingly to prevent the empty ValidationRequestError.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Union
from fastapi.params import Body

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    type_is_union = hasattr(field.type_, "__origin__") and field.type_.__origin__ is Union

    if (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and not type_is_union  # New condition to check if type is a Union
    ):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected code, we check if the field's type is a Union using `field.type_.__origin__ is Union` and exclude it from the validation process if it is a Union type. This modification should prevent the empty ValidationRequestError from being thrown when Union types are used as parameters.
