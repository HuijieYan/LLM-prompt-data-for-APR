The bug is likely occurring in the `is_scalar_field` function because it is responsible for checking if a field is a scalar field, and it may not be correctly handling Union types, which are used in the provided test case.

The bug is likely occurring because the `is_scalar_field` function does not account for Union types when determining if a field is a scalar field. When a field is defined as a Union type in FastAPI, the current implementation of `is_scalar_field` may not handle it correctly, leading to the empty ValidationRequestError.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to modify the `is_scalar_field` function to correctly handle Union types. This would involve checking if the field type is a Union and then recursively checking all the types within the Union to determine if they are scalar fields.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function that accounts for Union types:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if hasattr(field.type_, '__args__') and len(field.type_.__args__) > 1:
        # If the field type is a Union, recursively check each type in the Union
        return all(is_scalar_field(Field(type_=t, shape=field.shape, schema=field.schema) for t in field.type_.__args__)
    else:
        # Check if the field is a scalar field based on the current implementation
        return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        )
```

By recursively checking each type within the Union and applying the existing logic for determining if a field is a scalar field, we can ensure that Union types are correctly handled within the `is_scalar_field` function.
