The bug in the `is_scalar_field` function is in the condition `not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)`. This condition is checking if the field's schema is not an instance of `params.Body`, which is incorrect as `params` is not defined anywhere in the code provided.

The bug occurred because the comparison is made with an undefined class `params.Body`, causing the condition to always evaluate to `True` and leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, replace `params.Body` with `Query` as it appears that the intended check is for the schema to be an instance of `Query`.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from fastapi.params import Query

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Query)
    )
```
