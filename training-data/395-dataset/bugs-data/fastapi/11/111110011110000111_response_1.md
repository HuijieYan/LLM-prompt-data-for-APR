The error occurs within the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is intended to check if a given field is a scalar field based on certain conditions, but it seems to be throwing KeyErrors due to issues with field types and model name mappings.

One potential reason for this bug is that the `is_scalar_field` function might not be handling Union types correctly. It seems to have trouble with the validation of Union types, leading to KeyErrors during the validation process.

To fix this bug, the `is_scalar_field` function needs to be modified to correctly handle Union types and ensure that the validation process does not lead to KeyErrors.

Below is the corrected `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Type, Any

def is_scalar_field(field: Any) -> bool:
    # Handle Union type
    if getattr(field, "__origin__", None) is Union: 
        return all(is_scalar_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.__args__)
    # Additional condition checks for other types
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not isinstance(field, BaseModel)  # Used isinstance() instead of lenient_issubclass
        and not any(isinstance(field, t) for t in sequence_types + (dict,))  # Used any() and isinstance()
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

This corrected function addresses the issue with handling Union types and applies the necessary condition checks in a more appropriate way.
