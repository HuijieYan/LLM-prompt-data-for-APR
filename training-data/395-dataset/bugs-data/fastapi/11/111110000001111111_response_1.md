The issue seems to be related to the handling of Union types in request parameters. The bug in the `is_scalar_field` function may be causing the empty ValidationRequestError when request parameters are of Union type.

The bug seems to be in the `is_scalar_field` function where it checks for the field shape, type, and schema, but it does not account for Union types. This results in the function incorrectly rejecting valid Union type parameters.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to handle Union types correctly. It should allow Union types as valid scalar fields.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and not hasattr(field.type_, "__origin__")  # Check for Union type
    )
```

By adding the check `not hasattr(field.type_, "__origin__")`, the function now accounts for Union types and allows them as valid scalar fields.

This should fix the issue where empty ValidationRequestError is thrown when request parameters are of Union type.
