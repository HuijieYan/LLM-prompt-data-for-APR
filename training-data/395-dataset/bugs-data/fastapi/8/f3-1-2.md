Describe the bug

When calling APIRouter.include_router, the class of the included routes should be preserved. Right now, this is not the case -- the route_class of the parent router is used. This means that the route_class is lost on inclusion if one isn't careful. Worse, it means that even if you manually create a router with multiple route-types present, there is no way to include that router in another without changing the route type of some of the routes.

See the include_typed_router function from #521 for an example of how this currently requires a workaround.

I have addressed this in the short PR #538, but wanted to create an issue for discussion in case there is any reason to preserve the current behavior.
