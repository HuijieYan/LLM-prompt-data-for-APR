The provided error message indicates that the responses for different paths are being merged when defining routes with an `APIRouter` instance. This means the bug likely resides in the `include_router` method, specifically when combining responses.

The issue seems to be related to how the method `include_router` handles responses when processing multiple routes with different responses using the same `APIRouter` instance. Instead of keeping the responses for each route separate, the responses are being combined, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `include_router` method should handle responses for each route separately. It should not merge responses from different routes when adding routes to the `FastAPI` application.

Below is the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            responses.update(route.responses)  # Update responses with route-specific responses
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route.responses,  # Use route-specific responses
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, when processing an `APIRoute`, we update the `responses` with the route-specific responses using the `update` method instead of combining them. This ensures that each route's responses are handled separately.
