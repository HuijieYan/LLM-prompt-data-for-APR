The bug occurs in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. When the method is called, it iterates through routes of the provided router and adds routes to the current router with specified prefixes. However, there is a bug in route responses handling. The bug causes responses to be shared and overwritten for different routes. This is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `responses` for each route in the `include_router` method should be handled separately. One possible approach to fix the bug is to create a new dictionary for `responses` for each route and add them separately. This will prevent the responses from being shared and overwritten when adding routes to the current router.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
    def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
        responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                route_responses = {}  # Create a new dictionary for route responses
                if responses:
                    route_responses = responses.copy()  # Copy existing responses
                route_responses.update(route.responses)  # Update with route-specific responses
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=route_responses,  # Use route-specific responses

                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
```
