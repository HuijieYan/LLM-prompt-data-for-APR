The bug occurs because the `responses` are being shared and combined across different routes when they should be separate for each route. This is happening due to the way the responses are being combined when adding a new route to the APIRouter.

The issue is in the `include_router` function where the `responses` are being combined without considering the individual responses for each route.

To fix the bug, the `responses` for each route should be combined separately without sharing the same `responses` variable across different routes.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute, routing

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = route.responses.copy() if route.responses is not None else {}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this updated implementation, the `responses` are copied for each route using `route.responses.copy()` before being added. This will ensure that the `responses` for each route are kept separate and not shared across different routes.
