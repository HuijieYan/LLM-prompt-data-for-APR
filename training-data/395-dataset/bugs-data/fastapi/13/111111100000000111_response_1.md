The potential error location is in the `include_router` method within the `APIRouter` class.

The bug occurs because when routes with alternative responses are defined on the same API router instance, their responses are being shared. This is evident from the provided test case where defining routes with different alternative responses on the same API router results in the responses being merged and shared across the paths.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that each route's alternative responses are not shared and are specific to that route.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
    def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=route.responses,  # Use route-specific responses
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
```

In this corrected code, for each route, we use `route.responses` instead of the shared `responses` variable. This ensures that each route's alternative responses are specific to that route and not shared among other routes.
