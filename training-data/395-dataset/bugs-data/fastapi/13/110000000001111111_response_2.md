The bug occurs because when routes are added using `app.include_router()`, the responses for different paths are being merged. This means that if multiple routes use the same status code, their responses will be combined. This occurs only for `APIRouter`, not if paths are added directly to the `FastAPI` app instance.

To fix this bug, the `responses` dictionary should be initialized outside the loop where the routes are processed. Then, for each route, the responses should be added to the initialized `responses` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    combined_responses = responses if responses is not None else {}

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            combined_responses = {**combined_responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this fix, the responses for different paths will not be merged, and the expected behavior will be achieved.
