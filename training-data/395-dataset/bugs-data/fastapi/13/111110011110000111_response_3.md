Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `include_router` function within the `APIRouter` class. More specifically, the problem seems to be with the merging of responses when including routes from another router using the `include_router` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because when routes are added using the `include_router` function, the responses from the included routes are being merged with the existing responses in an unintended way. This leads to incorrect responses being associated with routes when they should be separate.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `include_router` function to handle responses from included routes separately and avoid merging them with existing responses.
2. Ensure that responses for different paths are not combined and remain distinct.
3. Consider explicitly providing responses for each route instead of trying to merge them from included routers.

Corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
    ) -> None:
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=route.responses,  # use responses directly from the route
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
```

In the corrected function, the responses are directly obtained from the included route and added to the APIRouter without merging them. This ensures that the responses for different routes remain separate and do not share the same values mistakenly.
