The error message is indicating an assertion failure in the `test_openapi_schema` function. The assertion is comparing the actual response JSON with the `openapi_schema` variable, and it fails because both JSON objects are not identical.

The potential error location within the `include_router` function is the way it handles the `responses` parameter. It attempts to merge the responses from different routes into a single dictionary, but it may lead to overwriting responses with the same status code.

The bug occurs because each route may have its own set of responses, and when merging them, the function doesn't properly handle scenarios where the same status code has different responses across different routes.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic to properly merge responses, ensuring that responses with the same status code are handled correctly (e.g., using lists to store multiple responses for the same status code).

Below is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            # Merge responses, handling multiple responses for the same status code
            for status_code, response in route.responses.items():
                if status_code in responses:
                    # If the status code already exists in the merged responses, store multiple responses in a list
                    if isinstance(responses[status_code], list):
                        responses[status_code].append(response)
                    else:
                        responses[status_code] = [responses[status_code], response]
                else:
                    responses[status_code] = response

            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),

                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
