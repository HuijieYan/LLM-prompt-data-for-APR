The error message indicates that the responses in the '/c' path are not being added correctly. It seems that the responses from the '/b' path are being added instead of adding the response specific to the '/c' path.

Upon analyzing the code, it is evident that the issue lies within the logic of adding responses in the `include_router` function. Specifically, the `responses` are being combined without differentiating between the routes, which is causing the responses to be overridden.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly combine the responses for each route individually. This can be achieved by creating a separate dictionary for each route and then merging those dictionaries sequentially.

Here's the corrected `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            route_responses = route.responses
            if responses:
                responses = {**responses, **route_responses}
            else:
                responses = route_responses
                
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this correction, the responses for each route will be combined correctly without overriding the responses from other routes. This should resolve the issue and align the test case with the expected outcome.
