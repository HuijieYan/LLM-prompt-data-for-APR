The bug in the provided function is that the responses dictionary is being overwritten with each iteration of the for loop. The function is intended to combine the responses from each route into a single dictionary, but it is currently replacing the responses dictionary instead of combining them.

To fix this issue, we can initialize the responses dictionary before the for loop and then update it within the loop by combining it with the route.responses dictionary.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute, Route, WebSocketRoute

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    combined_responses = responses or {}

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            combined_responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, we initialize the `combined_responses` dictionary with the provided `responses`, or an empty dictionary if `responses` is `None`. Then, inside the for loop, we use the `update` method to combine the `route.responses` with the `combined_responses` dictionary. This ensures that the combined responses from all routes are collected into a single dictionary, which is then used to add the API routes.
