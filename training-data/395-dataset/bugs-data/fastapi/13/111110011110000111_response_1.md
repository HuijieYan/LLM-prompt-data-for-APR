The bug is likely occurring in the `include_router` function within the `APIRouter` class.

The issue seems to stem from the problem that when routes are added in the `include_router` function, the responses from each route are being merged in an unintended way. This results in the responses from different paths being shared, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the `responses` dictionary within the `include_router` function is properly scoped and not shared between different routes. This can be achieved by creating a separate `responses` dictionary for each route and then passing it to the `add_api_route` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, response_model: Optional[Type[Model]] = None, status_code: int = 200, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None, summary: Optional[str] = None, description: Optional[str] = None, response_description: str = "Successful Response", responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None, deprecated: bool = False, methods: Optional[List[str]] = None, operation_id: Optional[str] = None, include_in_schema: bool = True, content_type: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, name: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    # corrected function
    def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
        responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                route_responses = {**(responses or {}), **route.responses}
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=route_responses,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
```

In this corrected code, a separate `route_responses` dictionary is created for each route, and it includes both the global `responses` dictionary and the responses specific to the route. This ensures that the responses for different paths will not be merged.
