The test case "test_openapi_schema" is checking if the response JSON matches the openapi_schema. The error message indicates that there is a difference in the responses part of the JSON.

The potential error location within the "include_router" function is the way responses are being concatenated and added. Every time a new route is processed, the responses are getting overwritten, leading to missing responses from previous routes.

The reason behind the bug is that the "responses" variable is reassigned within the loop for every route, which causes it to lose the previous route's responses.

One approach to fixing the bug is to initialize the "responses" variable outside the loop, and then update it for each route within the loop.

Here's the corrected code for the "include_router" function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
        
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)  # Update rather than reassign
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
