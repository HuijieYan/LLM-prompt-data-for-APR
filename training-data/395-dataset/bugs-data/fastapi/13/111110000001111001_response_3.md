The bug in the `include_router` function is that the `responses` dictionary is being overwritten inside the loop instead of being updated. Additionally, the `response_model` and `status_code` parameters are being passed to the `add_api_route` function but they are not defined in the function signature.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `responses` dictionary by merging it with the existing `responses` inside the loop, and also remove the undefined parameters from the `add_api_route` call.

The corrected `include_router` function is as follows:

```python
def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: Optional[List[str]] = None,
        responses: Optional[Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                if responses is None:
                    responses = {}
                responses.update(route.responses)  # Update the responses dictionary

                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=responses,  # Pass the updated responses dictionary
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
```

This corrected code updates the `responses` dictionary using the `update` method to merge it with the route's responses. This will ensure that the `responses` dictionary is correctly updated and passed to the `add_api_route` function.
