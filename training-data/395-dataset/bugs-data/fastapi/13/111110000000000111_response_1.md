The bug seems to be related to the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The issue is that when routes are defined with the same `APIRouter` instance, their alternative responses are shared.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the `responses` dictionary is being modified and then passed to the `add_api_route` method.

The bug occurs because the `responses` dictionary is being merged from the individual route responses, causing them to be shared among different routes.

To fix the bug, the `responses` dictionary should not be merged from the individual route responses. Instead, it should be handled separately for each route.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if route.responses is not None:
                responses = dict(route.responses)
            else:
                responses = {}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, we create a new `responses` dictionary for each route and copy the contents of the route's individual `responses` to it. This ensures that the `responses` are not shared among different routes.
