Based on the error message from the test function, it seems that the responses for different paths are being merged inappropriately when using the `include_router` function.

The potential error location within the `include_router` function is the part where it iterates over the routes in the provided router and adds the routes to the current router. In this process, the responses for each route might be getting merged in an unintended way.

The bug occurs because the responses dictionary isn't being properly handled. Each route in the `router` object contains its own set of responses, and these responses are being merged in a way that causes conflicts and unexpected behavior.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to adjust how the `responses` dictionary is updated for each route. Instead of merging the `responses` dictionary with the global `responses` at the beginning of the function, each route's responses should be added to the global `responses` separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}

    for route in router.routes:
        new_responses = {**responses, **route.responses}  # Merge the global responses with the route's responses
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=new_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this correction, the responses are merged correctly for each route, avoiding conflicts and unexpected behavior.
