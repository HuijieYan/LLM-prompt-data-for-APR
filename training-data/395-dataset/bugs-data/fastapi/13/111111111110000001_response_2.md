The given error message is comparing two JSON objects and indicating differences in the paths section. It seems to be related to the function `include_router` that is adding routes and responses to the APIRouter.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the way responses are being handled when adding a route using the `add_api_route` method. The function is incorrectly handling the responses, and this is leading to discrepancies in the test results.

The bug is occurring because the `responses` dictionary is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. The initial `responses` dictionary is being overwritten with the new route's responses instead of being updated incrementally.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `responses` dictionary with new route responses instead of overwriting it completely.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
        responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                current_responses = responses.copy() if responses is not None else {}
                current_responses.update(route.responses)
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=current_responses,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,

                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
