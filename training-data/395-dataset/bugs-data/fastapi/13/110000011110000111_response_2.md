The error occurs in the `include_router` function, specifically within the section where the `responses` are being merged. The bug occurs because when iterating over the routes in the `APIRouter`, the `responses` dictionary is being reset to an empty dictionary every time a new route is encountered. This leads to the unwanted merging of responses.

To fix the bug, instead of resetting the `responses` to an empty dictionary within the loop for each route, we should initialize `responses` as an empty dictionary outside of the loop and then update it with each route's responses.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Union
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi import APIRouter

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this correction, the responses are now properly updated with each route's responses, and the unwanted merging of responses should no longer occur.
