Potential Error Location: 
The buggy function "include_router" is trying to call the "add_api_route" function with more arguments than it is defined to accept.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The "include_router" function is trying to call the "add_api_route" function with additional arguments such as "response_model", "status_code", "tags", "summary", "description", "response_description", "responses", "deprecated", "methods", "operation_id", "include_in_schema", "content_type", and "name", which are not defined in the signature of the "add_api_route" function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the signature of the "add_api_route" function to accept additional keyword arguments.
2. Modify the call to "add_api_route" in the "include_router" function to only pass the arguments specified in the original signature.

Corrected code:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
