Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `include_router` method, specifically when adding responses from the routes to the final `responses` dictionary.

Reason for the bug: The bug may be caused by mishandling the `responses` dictionary within the loop that iterates over the routes. When there are multiple routes with responses, the code does not properly merge the responses into a single dictionary for the APIRouter.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize the `responses` dictionary outside the loop and then merge route responses into it.
2. Use the `update` method to merge dictionaries instead of using the `**` operator.

Corrected code:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Optional[Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    if responses is None:
        responses = {}

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = route.responses
            for status_code, response_data in route_responses.items():
                if status_code in responses:
                    responses[status_code].update(response_data)
                else:
                    responses[status_code] = response_data

            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route.responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
In the corrected code, the `responses` dictionary is properly initialized outside the loop, and the route responses are merged into it using the `update` method. This ensures that responses from multiple routes are merged correctly into a single `responses` dictionary for the APIRouter.
