The bug lies in the `include_router` function. The issue is occurring because the `responses` dictionary is being shared across all routes that are added using the `add_api_route` function. This is causing the responses to be merged when they should be separate for each route.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `responses` dictionary is not shared across different routes. Instead, it should be scoped to each route individually. One approach to fix this would be to create a new `responses` dictionary for each route inside the loop, and then update it as needed. This would prevent the responses from being merged across routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith('/'), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith('/'), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = dict(responses) if responses is not None else {}
            route_responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this fix, the `responses` dictionary is no longer shared across routes, and each route has its own scoped `route_responses` dictionary, preventing the issue of merged responses.
