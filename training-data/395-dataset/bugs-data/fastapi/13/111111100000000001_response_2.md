The potential error in the `include_router` function seems to be that the `add_api_route` function is being called with more arguments than it expects. The `add_api_route` function is defined with the signature `add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable) -> None` but is being called with additional arguments such as `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, `description`, `response_description`, `responses`, `deprecated`, `methods`, `operation_id`, `include_in_schema`, `content_type`, and `name`.

This bug occurred because the `add_api_route` function was being called with more arguments than it expects. To fix this bug, the additional arguments need to be either removed or handled appropriately. One approach to fixing this bug would be to modify the `add_api_route` method to accept an optional dictionary or keyword arguments (**kwargs) that can handle the additional parameters. This way, the function can still work with the new parameters without causing an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(prefix + route.path, route.endpoint)
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
