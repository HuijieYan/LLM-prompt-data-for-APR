The bug is located in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `responses` variable inside the function. The expected result in test case 1 is different from the variable `responses` in the bug case. It seems that the bug occurs because the `responses` variable is reset to an empty dictionary on each iteration of the loop. Instead, it should accumulate the responses from each route.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `responses` outside the loop and modify the logic inside the loop to accumulate the responses correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}  # Initialize responses if it is None outside the loop
        
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            combined_responses = responses.copy()  # Create a copy of responses to accumulate the responses
            combined_responses.update(route.responses)  # Update with responses from the current route
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,  # Pass the accumulated responses
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, we initialize the `responses` variable if it is `None` outside the loop and accumulate the responses from each route correctly before calling `add_api_route`. This should fix the bug and produce the expected results.
