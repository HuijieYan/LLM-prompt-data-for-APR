The bug occurs when defining routes with an APIRouter, as their alternative responses are shared. This leads to unexpected behavior when defining routes with the same APIRouter instance.

The issue lies within the `include_router` method of the APIRouter class. The problem arises from the way responses are handled in the loop when adding routes using the APIRouter instance. Instead of adding responses for each route separately, the method accumulates all responses and applies them to subsequent routes, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `include_router` method so that it correctly handles responses for each individual route without accumulating and applying them to subsequent routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        full_path = prefix + route.path
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                full_path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route.responses,  # This should only add the specific route responses
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                full_path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                full_path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
``` 

With this corrected code, the `include_router` method now ensures that responses for each route are handled properly, preventing them from being shared and accumulated across different routes.
