The bug occurs in the `include_router` function of the `APIRouter` class. The bug causes the responses for different paths to be merged, resulting in unexpected behavior when multiple routes are defined with an API router. This occurs because the `responses` dictionary is being combined for all routes, and the compiler never resets the responses on each iteration. 

To fix the bug, the responses should be reset to an empty dictionary at the start of each iteration in the for loop, and then updated with the responses of the current route.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    for route in router.routes:
        responses = {}  # Reset responses to an empty dictionary for each route
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this correction, each route will have its own separate responses dictionary, and the issue of shared responses should be resolved.
