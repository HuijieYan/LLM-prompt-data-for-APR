The error message from the test function indicates that the responses for routes defined with the same APIRouter instance are being shared.

The potential error location within the include_router function is the handling of responses when iterating through the routes of the provided APIRouter. Since the responses dictionary is shared between routes, it causes the issue described in the error message.

The bug occurs because the responses dictionary is not being properly isolated for each individual route. Instead, it is being combined and shared among all the routes when it should be specific to each route.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to create a new responses dictionary for each route and combine only the responses specific to that route. This will ensure that each route has its own isolated set of responses.

Here's the corrected code for the include_router function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union
from fastapi import APIRouter, routing

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = route.responses.copy() if route.responses else {}
            for k, v in responses.items():
                responses[k] = v.copy()  # Ensure responses are copied to prevent sharing
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

This fix ensures that each route has its own isolated set of responses by creating a new responses dictionary and copying the individual response values for each route.
