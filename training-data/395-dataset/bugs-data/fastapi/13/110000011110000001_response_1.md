The error message in the test function indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected and actual JSON responses when the `/openapi.json` endpoint is hit. It is likely that this discrepancy is related to the `include_router` function, which is used to add routes to the router but seems to be adding responses incorrectly, as indicated by the error message.

The bug in the `include_router` function is that the `responses` dictionary is not being handled correctly. When iterating over the routes, the responses from each route are being combined, which is causing the responses to accumulate incorrectly and result in the mismatch observed in the test function.

To fix this bug, the `responses` dictionary should be initialized outside the loop and then updated for each route, without overwriting the entire dictionary each time. This can be achieved using the `update` method.

Here's the corrected `include_router` function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute, Route, WebSocketRoute
from fastapi import APIRouter
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses:Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this correction, the `responses` dictionary is correctly updated for each route without overwriting existing values, which should address the mismatch observed in the test function.
