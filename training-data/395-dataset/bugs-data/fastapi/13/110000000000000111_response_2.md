The issue seems to be related to the `responses` variable being shared across different routes. This is because the `responses` variable is being initialized outside of the loop that iterates over the routes, and every time a route is processed, its responses are being merged into the `responses` variable.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that each route has its own separate `responses` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute, Route, WebSocketRoute
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import snake_case
from fastapi import APIRouter
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = dict(route.responses) if route.responses else {}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In this corrected code, we are creating a new `responses` dictionary for each route by using `dict(route.responses) if route.responses else {}`. This ensures that each route has its own separate `responses` dictionary and the issue of shared responses across different routes should be resolved.
