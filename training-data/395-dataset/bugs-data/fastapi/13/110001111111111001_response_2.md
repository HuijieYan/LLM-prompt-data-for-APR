The buggy function, `include_router`, is adding response data incorrectly which is causing the assertion error in the test case. The response dictionary is not being merged correctly in the buggy function. Instead, it is being overwritten for each route.

The bug occurs because `responses` gets initialized as `None` inside the loop. This results in the responses dictionary to be reset to an empty dictionary on each iteration. As a result, it only retains the responses from the last route.

To fix this issue, the responses dictionary should be initialized outside the loop. Then, it should be updated by merging the existing responses with the route responses using the `update` method of the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

The correction involves initializing `responses` outside the loop, and then using the `update` method to merge it with the route responses. This ensures that the responses dictionary retains the responses from all routes during the iteration.
