The bug occurs in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. When defining routes with an API router, their alternative responses are being shared, causing the responses for different paths to be merged. This only occurs for `APIRouter`, not if paths are added directly to the `FastAPI` app instance.

The bug is caused by the fact that `responses` is being updated without checking if it already has values, which leads to the accumulation of responses from different routes.

To fix the bug, before updating the `responses` with the responses from the current route, we need to check if `responses` already has values and only update it with new responses if it does not. This can be achieved by setting the initial value of `responses` to an empty dictionary and then using an if condition to check if it's empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi import APIRouter

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            if not responses:  # check if responses is empty
                responses = route.responses
            else:
                responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed and the expected behavior of not merging responses for different paths should be achieved.
