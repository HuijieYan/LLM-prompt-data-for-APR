The potential error in the `include_router` function is the use of `self.add_api_route` with parameters that do not exist in the function signature. This will result in a "TypeError" as the function is being called with unexpected arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `include_router` function and use the `add_api_route` function correctly with the appropriate arguments based on its signature.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint
            )
``` 

In this corrected code, the `add_api_route` function is called with the correct parameters based on its signature. The `update` method is used to update the `responses` dictionary instead of using the dictionary unpacking operator.
