The bug occurs in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. When routes are added using this method, the alternative responses are getting shared between routes, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The reason behind this bug is that the `responses` provided to the `include_router` method are being combined within the method before adding routes. This leads to the sharing of responses across different routes.

To fix this bug, the `responses` should not be combined within the `include_router` method. Instead, it should be passed along with each individual route.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=route.responses,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
```

With this corrected method, the alternative responses will not be shared across different routes, resolving the bug.
