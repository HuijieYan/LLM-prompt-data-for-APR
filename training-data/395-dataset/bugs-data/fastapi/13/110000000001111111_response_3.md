The bug occurs because each APIRoute instance is being added to the responses dictionary for every route. This results in the responses from one route being added to the responses for the next route, causing them to be shared.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize the responses dictionary outside of the loop and add the responses for each route to this dictionary without overwriting the existing responses.

Here's the corrected code for the include_router function:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Union
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute, WebsocketRoute, Route

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.get_path(), route.endpoint, methods=route.methods, include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema, name=route.name
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebsocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.get_path(), route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
