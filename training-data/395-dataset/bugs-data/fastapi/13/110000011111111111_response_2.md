The bug occurs in the `include_router` function where the `responses` are being shared between different routes. This causes the test case to fail because the responses for different paths are being merged when they shouldn't be.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to initialize `responses` outside of the loop, append responses from each route to it, and then use the combined `responses` for each route. This will ensure that the responses are not shared between routes.

Here's the corrected `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            for status_code, response in route.responses.items():
                if status_code in responses:
                    assert responses[status_code] == response, "Response for status code {} is defined differently on different routes".format(status_code)
                else:
                    responses[status_code] = response
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route.responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this correction, the responses for different paths will not be merged, and the test case should pass as per expectations.
