Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because when the `include_router` method is called and routes with responses are added, the responses are not properly isolated for each route. Instead, the responses are being merged across different routes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize an empty responses dictionary outside the loop and use it to accumulate the responses for each route.
2. Ensure that the responses dictionary is specific to each route and not shared across routes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = responses.copy() if responses else {}
            route_responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,

                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(

            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):

                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
