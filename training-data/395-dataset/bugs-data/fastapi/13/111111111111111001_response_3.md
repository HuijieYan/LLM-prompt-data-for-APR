The bug occurs in the function `include_router` within the `APIRouter` class. This function is responsible for combining route information from the provided router with the specified prefix and tags. The bug appears to be related to how it handles responses.

The `include_router` function takes a `router` object and iterates over its `routes`. For each route, if it's an `APIRoute`, it tries to combine the responses with the existing responses and then add the route using the `add_api_route` method. However, the bug seems to be in how it's handling the `responses` data. It initializes a new `responses` dictionary for each route, resulting in loss of previous responses.

To fix this bug, the `responses` variable should be initialized outside the loop so that it accumulates responses for all routes. Additionally, the response combination logic needs to be adjusted to correctly merge the responses dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this corrected code, the `responses` dictionary is initialized only once outside the loop and accumulates responses from all routes correctly. This should resolve the issue observed in the test.
