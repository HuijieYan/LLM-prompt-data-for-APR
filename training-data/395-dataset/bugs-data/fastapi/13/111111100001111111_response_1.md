The issue occurs when routes are defined with the same APIRouter instance, leading to the sharing of alternative responses. This means that if a route has specifically defined responses, those responses are applied to all subsequent routes defined with the same APIRouter instance, causing unexpected behavior.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where routes are being added to the APIRouter instance using the `include_router` method. Specifically, the merging of responses from different routes is causing the issue.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the responses for different paths are not merged. This can be achieved by modifying the function to handle responses for each route separately and ensuring that they do not interfere with or overwrite the responses of other routes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = route.responses.copy()  # Copy the responses from the route
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,  # Use the copied route responses
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

This corrected function copies the responses from each route and ensures that they are used independently when adding routes to the APIRouter instance. This prevents the issue of shared alternative responses for different paths.
