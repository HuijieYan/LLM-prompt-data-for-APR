The error seems to be related to the addition of responses in the include_router function. The error message indicates that the expected and actual JSON responses differ in the 'paths' section.

The bug occurs because the 'responses' dictionary is being re-initialized in every iteration of the loop. This leads to the loss of previously collected responses.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize the 'responses' dictionary outside the loop and combine the responses from each route without re-initializing 'responses' in every iteration of the loop.

Here's the corrected code for the include_router function:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Union
from fastapi import APIRouter, APIRoute

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        
    if responses is None:  # Initialize responses if it doesn't exist
        responses = {}
        
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)  # Combine responses
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,  # Use the combined responses
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        # ... (other route types)

```

With this correction, the 'responses' dictionary is properly combined without re-initializing it in every iteration, which should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
