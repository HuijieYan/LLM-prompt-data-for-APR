The bug is occurring in the `include_router` function, specifically when combining the responses for different routes. The bug is likely occurring when the responses are being combined, as it is causing the responses for different routes to be merged.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `responses` variable is not being reassigned or overwritten during each iteration of the loop. Instead, it should be initialized as an empty dictionary outside of the loop and then updated with the responses from each route.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
    
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

This correction ensures that the `responses` variable is not being overwritten in each iteration, preventing the merging of responses from different routes.
