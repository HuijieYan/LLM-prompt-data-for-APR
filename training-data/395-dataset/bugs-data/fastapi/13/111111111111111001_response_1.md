The bug in the code is related to the manipulation of the 'responses' dictionary within the 'include_router' function. The bug occurs because the 'responses' dictionary is being overridden in each iteration of the loop, causing the loss of previously added responses. This results in unexpected behavior when the response JSON is compared in the test case.

To fix the bug, the responses from each route should be combined and appended to the 'responses' dictionary outside of the loop. This will ensure that all responses are properly aggregated.

Additionally, the 'response_model', 'status_code', 'tags', 'summary', 'description', 'response_description', 'deprecated', 'name', 'content_type', and 'operation_id' fields should be passed as keyword arguments to the 'add_api_route' function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'include_router' function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    combined_responses = responses.copy() if responses else {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            combined_responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With these changes, the responses will be correctly combined and the function should operate as expected when tested.
