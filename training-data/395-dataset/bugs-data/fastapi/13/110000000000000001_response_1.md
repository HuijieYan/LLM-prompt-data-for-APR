Potential Error Location: The bug might be in the handling of the `responses` dictionary. It seems that the `responses` dictionary is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop, instead of merging with the responses from each route.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the `responses` dictionary is being reset to an empty dictionary in each iteration of the loop, causing the responses from each route to overwrite the previous ones. This results in only the responses from the last route being retained.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the merging of the `responses` dictionary from each route without overwriting the previous responses.

Corrected Code:

```python
from typing import List, Union, Dict, Any
from fastapi import APIRouter
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    existing_responses = responses or {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = route.responses
            merged_responses = {**existing_responses, **route_responses}
            existing_responses = merged_responses

            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=merged_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
