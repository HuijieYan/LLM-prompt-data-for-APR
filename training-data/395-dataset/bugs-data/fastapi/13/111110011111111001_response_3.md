The provided code contains a bug in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The bug is related to the handling of the `responses` dictionary inside the for loop. The `responses` dictionary is being combined inside the for loop without taking into account the existing values.

The bug is causing the responses to contain only the last route's responses, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test_openapi_schema test case.

To fix this bug, the approach would be to initialize the `responses` dictionary outside the for loop and then update it with each route's responses inside the loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    if responses is None:
        responses = {}

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = route.responses.copy()
            responses = {**responses, **route_responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

By initializing the `responses` dictionary before the for loop and updating it with each route's responses, the bug should be fixed, and the test_openapi_schema test case should pass without any assertion errors.
