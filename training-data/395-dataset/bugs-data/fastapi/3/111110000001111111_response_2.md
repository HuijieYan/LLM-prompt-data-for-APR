The bug in the `serialize_response` function is likely related to the `exclude_unset` parameter not functioning as expected, leading to unwanted fields being included in the response.

The issue is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `exclude_unset` parameter when serializing the response content.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the response content is a list of items and then iterate through each item to apply the exclusion of unset values. Also, the handling of `is_coroutine` and `response_content` validation needs to be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        if isinstance(response_content, list):
            serialized_response = []
            for item in response_content:
                serialized_item = item.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset) if exclude_unset else item
                serialized_response.append(serialized_item)
        else:
            serialized_response = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset) if exclude_unset else response_content

        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors = field.validate(serialized_response, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors = await run_in_threadpool(field.validate, serialized_response, {}, loc=("response",))

        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)

        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

This corrected code includes logic to handle the `exclude_unset` parameter for both single item responses and list responses, ensuring that unset fields are excluded as expected. Additionally, it aims to address the issues related to `is_coroutine` and `response_content` validation.
