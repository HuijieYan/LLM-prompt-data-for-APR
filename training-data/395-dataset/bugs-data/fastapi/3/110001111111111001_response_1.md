The error messages indicate that the function `serialize_response` is failing due to missing fields in the response data. The error occurs in both simple responses and more complex responses such as lists and dictionaries of responses.

The issue is happening because the function is not handling missing fields properly, causing validation errors.

To fix the bug:
- Check if the `field` parameter is not None, if so, handle the response based on the `field`'s validation before attempting to encode it.
- Handle the case where the `response_content` is a BaseModel and the `exclude_unset` flag is True, as the current code does not handle this scenario properly.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Any, Union, Set, Dict
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError

async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: BaseModel = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    exclude: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            response_content = response_content.dict(
                exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
                include=include,
                exclude=exclude,
                by_alias=by_alias
            )
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = await field.validate(response_content, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, loc=("response",))
        if errors_:
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.__class__)
        return value
    else:
        return response_content
```

Please note that some specific details of the `ModelField` class and its usage were not provided in the original code, so I used a generic `BaseModel` class instead for demonstration purposes. Depending on the actual implementation, the corrected code might need some adjustment.
