The bug is occurring in the `serialize_response` function, where the `exclude_unset` parameter is not working as intended when returning a List of models. This can be seen in the GitHub issue titled "Returning List[response_model] doesn't respect response_model_exclude_unset."

The bug is also causing issues with response models that include aliases since FastAPI 0.47.1, as described in the GitHub issue titled "Cannot return response containing pydantic model that includes aliases since FastAPI 0.47.1."

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `exclude_unset` parameter works correctly when returning a List of models and that it also respects response models containing aliases.

The corrected code for the `serialize_response` function is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_3/fastapi/routing.py

# this is the corrected function
from typing import Union, Any, List, Dict

async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, List):
            new_response_content = []
            for item in response_content:
                if is_coroutine:
                    value, errors_ = field.validate(item, {}, loc=("response",))
                else:
                    value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                        field.validate, item, {}, loc=("response",)
                    )
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                if errors:
                    raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
                new_response_content.append(value)
            response_content = new_response_content
        return jsonable_encoder(
            response_content,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content, by_alias=by_alias)
```

This corrected function should address the issues related to returning List[response_model] and response models containing aliases.
