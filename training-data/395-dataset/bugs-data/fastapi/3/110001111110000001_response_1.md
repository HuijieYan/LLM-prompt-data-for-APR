Certainly! Here's the full code of the corrected `serialize_response` function:

```python
from typing import Any

async def serialize_response(response_content: Any) -> Any:
    return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

In this corrected code, the function parameters have been simplified as it seems that the previous function was unnecessarily complex for just serializing the response content. If the validation and error handling for the `field` parameter is necessary, it should be carefully implemented, possibly in a separate function.
