Based on the error messages and the associated test functions, it seems that the problematic function `serialize_response` is causing validation errors when returning responses containing Pydantic models with aliases. This is likely due to a change in handling aliases introduced in FastAPI 0.47.1.

To fix the bug:
1. The `serialize_response` function should be updated to properly handle response models with field aliases. This can be achieved by modifying the way the response content is serialized, particularly when dealing with models that contain aliased fields.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper, ValidationError
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder

async def serialize_response(
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            response_content = response_content.dict(by_alias=by_alias, exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return value
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(
            response_content,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset
        )
```

This corrected function includes changes to properly handle field aliases in the response content serialization, ensuring that responses containing Pydantic models with aliases are handled correctly.

It's important to note that the `run_in_threadpool` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere and is used within the `serialize_response` function.

Additionally, it's advisable to consider updating the associated test cases to verify the corrected behavior of the `serialize_response` function.
