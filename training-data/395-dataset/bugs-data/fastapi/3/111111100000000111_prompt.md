# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Returning List[response_model] doesn't respect response_model_exclude_unset
```

## The associated detailed issue description

Describe the bug
Not sure if this should be a Feature request or a bug.

When returning a List of models, the response includes "unset" key/values when response_model_exclude_unset is set to True.

To Reproduce
Create a file with:
import pydantic
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

class Item(pydantic.BaseModel):
    foobar: str = "foobar"
    foo: str
    bar: str = None

ALL_ITEMS = [Item(foo="foo0"), Item(foo="foo1"), Item(foo="foo2")]

@app .get("/items", response_model=List[Item], response_model_exclude_unset=True)
def get_all_items():
    return ALL_ITEMS

@app .get("/items/{item_index}", response_model=Item, response_model_exclude_unset=True)
def get_item(item_index: int):
    return ALL_ITEMS[item_index]
Open the browser and call the endpoint /items.
It returns a JSON with...
[
  {
    "foobar": "foobar",
    "foo": "foo0",
    "bar": null
  },
  {
    "foobar": "foobar",
    "foo": "foo1",
    "bar": null
  },
  {
    "foobar": "foobar",
    "foo": "foo2",
    "bar": null
  }
]
But I expected it to return...
[
  {
    "foo": "foo0"
  },
  {
    "foo": "foo1"
  },
  {
    "foo": "foo2"
  }
]
Expected behavior
I would expect /items and /items/{item_index} to return the same representation of an item.

Environment
OS: Windows and MacOS
FastAPI Version: 0.47.1
Python version: 3.7.3
Additional context
The main thing I'm trying to achieve here is to exclude nulls when using List[MyModel]. Currently, the only workaround that I know of is to do one of the following.

create a new response AllItems model and overload dict()
create a middleware that strips response nulls.
use an arbitrary dict (I don't want to do this)
However, given the prevalence of API's that have a /<all_items>, /<single_item> I would think that using response_model_exclude_unset or exclude_none is the more intuitive way to achieve this.
```

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Cannot return response containing pydantic model that includes aliases since FastAPI 0.47.1
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Starting in 0.47.1, responses fail validation if they include any pydantic model objects that contain field aliases
You can work around this by explicitly calling .dict(by_alias=True) on the top-level response model object before returning it from the path operation function (see the example below). However, this is super unintuitive and makes the use of field aliases painful. In our codebase we use aliases extensively (via Config.alias_generator) to expose camelCase in our public APIs while keeping our internal field names snake_case, and this issue is a real hassle.

To Reproduce
Create a test.py file with:
import fastapi
import pydantic
import starlette.testclient
from typing import List

app = fastapi.FastAPI()

class Item(pydantic.BaseModel):
    my_value: int = pydantic.Field(..., alias='myValue')

class RootResponse(pydantic.BaseModel):
    items: List[Item] = pydantic.Field(...)

@app.get('/broken_1', response_model=RootResponse)
async def broken_1():
    # embedded models don't work if they have aliased fields
    return {'items': [Item(myValue=5), Item(myValue=10)]}

@app.get('/broken_2', response_model=RootResponse)
async def broken_2():
    # making the top-level response a model instance doesn't help
    return RootResponse(items=[Item(myValue=5), Item(myValue=10)])

@app.get('/workaround', response_model=RootResponse)
async def workaround():
    # workaround is to build a top-level model and then dict(by_alias=True)
    return RootResponse(items=[Item(myValue=5), Item(myValue=10)]).dict(by_alias=True)

with starlette.testclient.TestClient(app) as test_client:
    for path in ['/broken_1', '/broken_2', '/workaround']:
        try:
            print('-------------------------------------------')
            print(path)
            response = test_client.get(path)
        except Exception as exc:
            print(exc)
        else:
            print('succeeded')
Run python3 test.py with FastAPI 0.47.0. All 3 cases succeed.
Run python3 test.py with FastAPI 0.49.0. Only the "workaround" case succeeds.
Expected behavior
Model classes that include aliased fields (whether the alias is directly specified on the field as in the above example, or using a pydantic Config.alias_generator) should be usable with the context of a response model.

Environment
OS: Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)
FastAPI Version: 0.47.1 and above
Python version: 3.7, 3.8
