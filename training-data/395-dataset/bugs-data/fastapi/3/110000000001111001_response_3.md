The potential error in the given code is the misuse of `is_coroutine` and `await` keywords within the function. The function signature specifies that `is_coroutine` is a boolean flag, but it is being used to control the flow of the program as if it were an async/await keyword. This is causing a syntax error as it is not supported in the current context.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `is_coroutine` parameter from the function signature and remove the conditional statements related to `is_coroutine`. Since the function is already marked as `async`, we can safely assume that the field validation will always be awaited.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
            else:
                response_content = response_content.dict(
                    skip_defaults=exclude_unset
                )  # pragma: nocover
        value, errors_ = await field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

In the corrected code, the `is_coroutine` parameter has been removed from the function signature and the conditional statements related to it have been removed. The `field.validate` function is awaited directly without any conditional checks based on the `is_coroutine` flag.
