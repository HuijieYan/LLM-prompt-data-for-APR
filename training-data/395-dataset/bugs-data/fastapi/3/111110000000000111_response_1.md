The provided function `serialize_response` is not directly related to either of the two GitHub issues mentioned. However, based on the detail provided, it seems that the issue is with the response model's serialization behavior, particularly related to the `exclude_unset` and `by_alias` parameters. The main problem seems to be that the response model serialization is not respecting the `exclude_unset` flag while returning a list of response models.

To fix the bug, you need to update the function to correctly respond to the provided `exclude_unset` and `by_alias` parameters when the response content is a list of response models.

Here's the corrected function for `serialize_response`:

```python
from typing import List

async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    errors = []
    if field:
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, List) and all(isinstance(item, BaseModel) for item in response_content):
            for idx, content in enumerate(response_content):
                if is_coroutine:
                    value, errors_ = field.validate(content, {}, loc=("response", idx))
                else:
                    value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                        field.validate, content, {}, loc=("response", idx)
                    )
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                response_content[idx] = value
                
            if errors:
                raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
                
            return [jsonable_encoder(
                item,
                include=include,
                exclude=exclude,
                by_alias=by_alias,
                exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
            ) for item in response_content]
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content, by_alias=by_alias, exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the response content is a list of BaseModel instances and then loop through each item to apply the validation and serialization logic based on the `exclude_unset` and `by_alias` parameters. This approach ensures that the behavior of response model serialization respects the provided parameters.

The corrected function is able to handle the serialization of a list of response models while considering the `exclude_unset` and `by_alias` parameters as intended.
