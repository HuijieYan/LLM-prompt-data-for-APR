The bug is present because `response_model_exclude_unset` is not working as expected when returning a list of models. This results in the unset key/values being included in the response, even when `response_model_exclude_unset` is set to `True`. The bug is also observed when trying to return a response containing pydantic model objects with field aliases, starting in FastAPI 0.47.1.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `serialize_response` function to handle these scenarios correctly.

The potential error location within the code is when the `jsonable_encoder` function is called, as this is where the response is being serialized and where the bug is occurring.

To fix the bug, the `jsonable_encoder` function needs to be updated to handle the `response_model_exclude_unset` and field aliases correctly. This can be achieved by checking if the response is a list and then processing each item individually, ensuring that the `response_model_exclude_unset` and field aliases are respected.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from pydantic.main import BaseModel
from typing import Any, Union, Set

async def serialize_response(
    response_content: Any,
    response_model_exclude_unset: bool = False,
    by_alias: bool = True,
    include: Set[str] = set(),
    exclude: Set[str] = set()
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(response_content, list):
        response = []
        for item in response_content:
            if isinstance(item, BaseModel):
                item_dict = item.dict(
                    by_alias=by_alias,
                    exclude_unset=response_model_exclude_unset
                )
                response.append(item_dict)
            else:
                response.append(item)
        return response
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(
            response_content,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=response_model_exclude_unset
        )
```

This corrected code checks if the response content is a list and then processes each item individually, respecting the `response_model_exclude_unset` and field aliases as needed.
