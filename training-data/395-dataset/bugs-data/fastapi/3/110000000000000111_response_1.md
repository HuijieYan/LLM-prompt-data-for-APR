The bug seems to be related to how pydantic models are handled in the response serialization process. The error messages indicate issues with excluding unset fields and with models containing aliases.

Looking at the code, the potential error location seems to be in the `serialize_response` function where the response serialization is being handled.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `exclude_unset` and `by_alias` parameters are not being used correctly in the response serialization process.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
1. Properly handling excluded unset fields for pydantic models in the serialization process.
2. Ensuring that fields with aliases are handled correctly during response serialization.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from typing import Any


# Corrected serialize_response function
async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: BaseModel = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: set = None,
    exclude: set = None,
    by_alias: bool = False,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset, by_alias=by_alias)
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

This corrected function now explicitly uses the `exclude_unset` and `by_alias` parameters where required and should handle pydantic models containing aliases as well as exclude unset fields during response serialization.
