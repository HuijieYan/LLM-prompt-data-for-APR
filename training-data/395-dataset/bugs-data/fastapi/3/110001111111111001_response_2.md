The error occurs in the `serialize_response` function due to the mishandling of the `field` parameter. The `field` parameter is passed in as a keyword argument with a default value of `None`. However, the function does not handle the case where `field` is not provided correctly, leading to errors in the validation process.

Based on the error messages provided, it seems that the `field` parameter is expected to have certain attributes for validation, and when it's not provided or has missing attributes, validation errors occur.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to properly handle the case where `field` is not provided. This can be done by adding a check for `field` being `None` and returning the response directly without attempting validation in that case.

Here's the corrected `serialize_response` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Union, Set, Dict
from pydantic import BaseModel, ModelField, ValidationError, jsonable_encoder

async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    exclude: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
            else:
                response_content = response_content.dict(skip_defaults=exclude_unset)
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

In the corrected function:
- The type hints for `include` and `exclude` have been fixed to use the `Set` and `Dict` types.
- A check for `field` being `None` has been added before attempting validation, and direct encoding of the response without validation is performed if `field` is not provided.

This should address the bug and prevent the validation errors seen in the test cases.
