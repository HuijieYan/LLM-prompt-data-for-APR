The function `serialize_response` is causing the error. It is designed to serialize the response content based on certain parameters. The error occurs due to the mishandling of model fields with aliases, resulting in missing fields in the response.

The potential error location is within the conditional block that handles the `is_coroutine` parameter. The code is not properly handling the validation of model fields with aliases, leading to the missing fields in the response.

The bug occurs because the function does not appropriately handle response content that includes aliases in the model fields. This causes the fields to be missing from the response, leading to validation errors.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `field.validate` method properly handles model fields with aliases. Additionally, the code should correctly use the `by_alias` parameter during serialization to include aliased fields in the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset, by_alias=by_alias)
            else:
                response_content = response_content.dict(skip_defaults=exclude_unset, by_alias=by_alias)
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = await field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content, by_alias=by_alias)
```

In the corrected code, the `by_alias` parameter is being used consistently during the serialization process to include aliased fields in the response when necessary. This should address the bug related to missing fields in the response due to model field aliases.
