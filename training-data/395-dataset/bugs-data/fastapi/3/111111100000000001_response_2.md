Potential error location: The potential error is in the conditional statement `if is_coroutine:`. The `is_coroutine` variable is a boolean, but it is being used as if it is a coroutine function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is caused by incorrect usage of the `is_coroutine` variable. It is being used as a condition for checking whether the `field.validate` function is a coroutine or not, but it should be checked against some coroutine function instead. Additionally, the logic that follows this conditional statement seems to be incorrect as it is trying to call `field.validate` as a coroutine function using `await` in the `else` block, which is not possible because `field.validate` is not an async function.

Possible approach to fixing the bug: 
1. Adjust the conditional statement to check for the type of `field.validate` function instead of using the `is_coroutine` variable.
2. Remove the incorrect usage of `await` in the `else` block.

Corrected code:
```python
async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
            else:
                response_content = response_content.dict(
                    skip_defaults=exclude_unset
                )  # pragma: nocover
        if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(field.validate):
            value, errors_ = await field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
