Potential error and reasons:
The potential error location could be the `serialize_response` function as it is responsible for serializing the response and formatting the JSON output. 

The reason behind the bug is that when returning a List of models, the response includes "unset" key/values when `response_model_exclude_unset` is set to True. This is not the expected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `serialize_response` function so that it respects the `response_model_exclude_unset` setting for response models and does not include "unset" key/values in the serialized response. Additionally, the function should also handle field aliases properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from typing import Any, Union, Set, Dict, List
from pydantic import BaseModel, ErrorWrapper, Field
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from fastapi.logger import logger

async def serialize_response(
    response_content: Any,
    response_model: Union[BaseModel, List[BaseModel]],
    response_model_exclude_unset: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(response_model, list):
        return [
            serialize_response(
                item, response_model=response_model.__args__[0],
                response_model_exclude_unset=response_model_exclude_unset
            )
            for item in response_content
        ]
    else:
        def_model = response_model.construct()
        field_values = response_content.dict(by_alias=True)
        fields_to_remove = []
        for field in def_model.__fields_set__:
            if field not in field_values:
                fields_to_remove.append(field)
        for field in fields_to_remove:
            delattr(def_model, field)

        return jsonable_encoder(
            def_model,
            exclude_unset=response_model_exclude_unset
        )
```
