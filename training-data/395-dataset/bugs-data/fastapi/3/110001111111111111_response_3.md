The issue seems to stem from the `serialize_response` function causing validation errors when returning lists or dictionaries of response models. The issue is related to the handling of excluded or unset fields in the response.

The potential error location within the problematic function can be the section where the `exclude_unset` parameter is checked. When `exclude_unset` is set to `True`, the function should exclude unset fields from the response, but it seems to be causing validation errors instead.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle excluded or unset fields properly when returning lists or dictionaries of response models. This results in validation errors when the excluded fields are encountered.

To fix the bug, the `serialize_response` function needs to properly handle the exclusion of unset fields when returning lists or dictionaries of response models. The function should not raise validation errors for excluded or unset fields, but should properly exclude them from the response.

The corrected code for the `serialize_response` function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Any, Union, Set, Dict
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ValidationError
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.types import SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny
from fastapi.concurrency import run_in_threadpool

async def serialize_response(
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)

        if is_coroutine:
            value, _ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, _ = await run_in_threadpool(
                field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )

        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

This corrected function better handles the exclusion of unset fields and should no longer raise validation errors when returning lists or dictionaries of response models.
