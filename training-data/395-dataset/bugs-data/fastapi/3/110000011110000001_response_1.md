The error message indicates that there are missing fields in the response, which leads to a validation error. This is likely caused by the `serialize_response` function not handling the response data correctly.

After analyzing the provided function, it seems that the main issue is with how the function is checking for the presence of the `field` argument. It is used to perform some validation and transformation on the `response_content`. However, in the current implementation, the function does not handle the case where `field` is `None`, which leads to the validation errors in the tests.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where `field` is `None`. Instead of trying to validate and transform the `response_content` when `field` is `None`, the function should directly return the `response_content`.

Here's the corrected `serialize_response` function:

```python
async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
            else:
                response_content = response_content.dict(
                    skip_defaults=exclude_unset
                )  
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        # When field is None, just return the original response_content
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the case where `field` is `None` and return the `response_content` without trying to perform unnecessary validation and transformation.

This should resolve the validation errors encountered in the tests.
