The error "pydantic.error_wrappers.ValidationError: X validation errors for Item" occurs in the `serialize_response` function. This error is triggered when required fields are missing from the response_content while trying to serialize the response.

After analyzing the code, the potential error location is identified as the logic responsible for validating and serializing the response content based on the provided field.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling required fields properly when trying to validate and serialize the response content.

To fix the bug, the `serialize_response` function needs to properly handle the validation and serialization of the response content. This involves ensuring that required fields are present in the response content before attempting to validate and serialize it.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
            else:
                response_content = response_content.dict(
                    skip_defaults=exclude_unset
                )  # pragma: nocover
        
        # Validate the response content
        validation_ctx = {"loc": ("response",)}
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = await run_validation(field, response_content, validation_ctx)
        else:
            value, errors_ = run_validation(field, response_content, validation_ctx)
        
        # Check for validation errors
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        
        # Serialize the validated value
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

In the corrected code:
- The validation of the response content is handled using the `run_validation` function.
- Validation errors are appropriately collected and raised as a `ValidationError` if present.
- The serialized value is returned based on the validated content.

This correction ensures that required fields are properly validated and serialized in the response content, addressing the validation errors encountered in the test cases.
