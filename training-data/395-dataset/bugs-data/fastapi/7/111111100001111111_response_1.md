The issue seems to be with the `exc.errors()` method, which is expected to return a list of errors, but instead returns a method object. This leads to an internal server error (500) instead of a proper validation error (422) with an explanation of what was invalid.

To fix this issue, the `exc.errors()` method should be replaced with just `exc.errors` to access the list of errors directly. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, 
        content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

With this change, the function should now properly return a 422 response along with an explanation of what is invalid about the payload.
