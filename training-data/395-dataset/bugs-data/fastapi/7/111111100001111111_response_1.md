The issue is with the `exc.errors()` call in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function. The `exc.errors` is already a list, so we need to remove the `()` in the `exc.errors()` call.

The reason for the bug is that the `exc.errors` is being treated as a method and called as `exc.errors()`, which is incorrect. It should be accessed directly as a property of `exc`.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `()` from `exc.errors()`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

# corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

With this correction, the `exc.errors` will be accessed directly without being called as a method, and the bug should be fixed.
