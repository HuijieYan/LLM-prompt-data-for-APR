## Bug Explanation
The issue with the buggy function is that it's trying to call the `errors()` method on the `exc` object, which is not the correct way to access the validation errors. The `errors` attribute of the `RequestValidationError` object should be accessed directly instead of trying to call it as a method.

## Correction Plan
1. Access the `errors` attribute directly from the `exc` object instead of trying to call it as a method.

## Corrected code
```python
from fastapi import Request, JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
