The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of validation errors for constrained decimals, leading to a 500 internal server error instead of the expected 422 validation error response.

The bug is occurring in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, where the `exc.errors()` method is being called to retrieve the validation errors. The `exc.errors` is actually a bound method, but it should be treated as a property or attribute to access the validation errors.

To fix the bug, the `exc.errors()` method should be replaced with `exc.errors` to correctly access the validation errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

By making this change, the function will correctly access the validation errors and return a 422 response code along with an explanation of what is invalid about the number, as expected.
