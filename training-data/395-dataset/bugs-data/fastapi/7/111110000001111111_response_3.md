The bug in the provided function is that the exc.errors is being called as a method when it should be accessed as an attribute.

The reason behind this bug is that exc is an instance of RequestValidationError, and errors is an attribute of RequestValidationError, not a method. Therefore, it should be accessed directly as exc.errors, rather than calling it as a method.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the parentheses from exc.errors, so that it is accessed as an attribute rather than being called as a method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
