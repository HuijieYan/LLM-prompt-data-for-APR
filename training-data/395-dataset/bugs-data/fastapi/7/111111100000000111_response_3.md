The issue seems to be related to the handling of RequestValidationError in the request_validation_exception_handler function. The function is currently returning a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error when an invalid condecimal is sent to the FastAPI service.

The potential error location is in the return statement of the request_validation_exception_handler function, specifically in the content parameter of the JSONResponse. Instead of exc.errors(), it should be exc.errors() dict, as RequestValidationError contains a dict of errors.

The bug occurred because the content parameter of the JSONResponse was not being set correctly to the errors dictionary from the RequestValidationError.

To fix the bug, we need to access the errors dictionary from the RequestValidationError and return it as the content of the JSONResponse.

Here's the corrected code for the request_validation_exception_handler function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

# corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

With this correction, the request_validation_exception_handler function should now correctly return a 422 validation error along with an explanation of what is invalid about the number, as expected.
