The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `exc.errors()` as this is not the correct way to access the validation errors in FastAPI.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `exc.errors()` does not exist as a method or property in the RequestValidationError object. This results in an internal server error (status code 500) being returned instead of the expected 422 validation error with an explanation of what is invalid.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to access the validation errors using `exc.errors()` and return a JSONResponse with a status code of 422 along with the validation errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content=jsonable_encoder({"detail": exc.errors()})
    )
```
