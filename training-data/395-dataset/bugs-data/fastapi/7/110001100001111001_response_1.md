Potential error location: The error is occurring in the line `{"detail": exc.errors()}` where `exc.errors` is being treated as a method and is being called with `()`, but it is actually an attribute that contains the validation errors.

Reasons behind the bug:
- The variable `exc.errors` is being incorrectly treated as a method and being called with `()`.
- It should be treated as an attribute that contains the validation errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Access the `errors` attribute directly without calling it as a method.

Corrected code:
```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
