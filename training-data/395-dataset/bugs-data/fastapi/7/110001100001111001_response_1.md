The potential error in the provided function is that `exc.errors` is being called as a method, but it should be accessed as a property instead. 

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `exc.errors` property is being treated as a method, which is resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, simply remove the parentheses after `exc.errors` to access it as a property instead of calling it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
