The error occurs because the function request_validation_exception_handler is attempting to return the content from exc.errors() without considering the data type or serialization of the returned value. The error message indicates that the exc.errors() is returning a Decimal object which is not JSON serializable, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the content returned by exc.errors() is properly serialized to JSON before returning it in the JSONResponse.

```python
from starlette.responses import Response
from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException
from starlette.types import ASGIApp, Message, Receive, Scope, Send
from fastapi.requests import Request
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError


async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> Response:
    content = {"detail": exc.errors()}
    return JSONResponse(status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content=content)
```

The above code fixes the bug by properly constructing the content to be returned. The exc.errors() is included as part of the content dictionary, which will be properly serialized to JSON by the JSONResponse class before being returned.
