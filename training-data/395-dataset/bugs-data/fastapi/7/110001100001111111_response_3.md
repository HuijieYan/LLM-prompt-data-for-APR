The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the `RequestValidationError` in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function. The function is returning a JSONResponse with the result of calling `exc.errors()` which is a method, and not the actual errors themselves.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `exc.errors()` method to get the actual errors and include that in the content of the JSONResponse.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError, RequestValidationError
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

With this corrected function, the `exc.errors()` method is properly called to retrieve and include the actual errors in the response, ensuring that the correct error response is returned when handling `RequestValidationError` in FastAPI.
