The bug in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function is that it is trying to return the result of calling `exc.errors()` which is not a valid operation. It seems that `exc.errors` returns a list of validation errors, and should be accessed directly without the parentheses.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to access `exc.errors` directly and return it as the content of the JSONResponse.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

# corrected function
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

With this correction, the function will return a 422 response along with an explanation of what is invalid about the payload, as expected. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
