Potential Error:
The function is trying to call `exc.errors()` as a method, but `errors` is likely an attribute of the `RequestValidationError` class, so it should be accessed as `exc.errors`.

Reason for the Bug:
The function is trying to call `exc.errors()` as if it were a method, but it is likely an attribute of the `RequestValidationError` class. 

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Access the `errors` attribute directly from the `RequestValidationError` object `exc`.

Corrected Code:
```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
