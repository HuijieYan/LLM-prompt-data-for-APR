Potential error location: 
The error in the code is that `exc.errors()` is being called as a method, but it should be accessed as a property. 

Reason behind the bug:
The RequestValidationError exception likely has an attribute or property called `errors`, rather than a method. Therefore, calling it as a method will result in an AttributeError.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to access the `errors` attribute of the `RequestValidationError` directly, rather than calling it as a method.

Corrected code:
```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
