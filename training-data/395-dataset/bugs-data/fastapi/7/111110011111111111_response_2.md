The bug in the provided code is related to the serialization of the `exc.errors` object. The error message mentions that the `Decimal` object within `exc.errors` is not JSON serializable, causing a `TypeError`. This is leading to a 500 internal server error instead of the expected 422 validation error.

To fix this bug, the `exc.errors` object needs to be properly serialized to be returned as JSON in the response. The `Decimal` object within `exc.errors` should be converted to a serializable data type, such as a string or float, before being included in the JSON response.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
# Fixed function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    errors = exc.errors()
    # Convert Decimal to float for serialization
    for error in errors:
        if 'limit_value' in error['ctx']:
            error['ctx']['limit_value'] = float(error['ctx']['limit_value'])
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": errors}
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `exc.errors` are retrieved and then looped over to check for the presence of `limit_value`, which is a `Decimal` object. If present, it is converted to a float using the `float()` function to ensure it can be properly serialized to JSON. The updated `errors` object is then included in the JSON response.

This fix should resolve the serialization issue and ensure that the response is correctly returned with a 422 status code along with an explanation of what is invalid about the input.
