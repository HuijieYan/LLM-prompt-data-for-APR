The error occurs because the `exc.errors` value of the `RequestValidationError` is a method, which is not JSON serializable. The `RequestValidationError` itself should be returned as the content of the JSONResponse.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_validation_exception_handler` function to extract the error details from `exc` and return them in the JSONResponse.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_detail = exc.errors()
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_detail}
    )
```

With this correction, the `exc.errors()` method is called and its result is assigned to `error_detail`, which is then returned in the JSONResponse content, allowing for proper serialization.
