The error is occurring in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, which is designed to handle `RequestValidationError` exceptions and return a JSON response with a 422 status code and an explanation of what is invalid.

The reason for the bug is that the `exc.errors()` method is being called without parentheses, which means it is being treated as an attribute rather than a method. This results in a TypeError when the function is called.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `exc.errors()` method with parentheses to properly execute it and retrieve the error details.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the `RequestValidationError` and return a JSON response with a 422 status code and an explanation of what is invalid.
