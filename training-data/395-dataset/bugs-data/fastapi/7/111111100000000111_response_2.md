The bug is occurring in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function in the file `exception_handlers.py`. The function is supposed to handle validation errors and return a 422 status code along with an explanation of what is invalid, but it is currently returning a 500 status code for invalid condecimal inputs.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not correctly handling the RequestValidationError from the pydantic library. The `exc.errors()` call is likely causing the TypeError and resulting in a 500 status code.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the RequestValidationError correctly and return a 422 status code along with an explanation of what is invalid in the request.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

from fastapi import Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```
