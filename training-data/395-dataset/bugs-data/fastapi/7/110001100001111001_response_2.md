Potential Error Location: The error occurs on the line where exc.errors() is called to retrieve the errors from the RequestValidationError object.

Reason for Bug: The error occurs because exc.errors is being treated as a method and called with parentheses, but it is actually a method. This results in a TypeError.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: Instead of calling exc.errors(), we can directly use exc.errors to access the errors attribute of the RequestValidationError object.

Corrected Code:
```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
