The potential error in the provided function lies in the line `content={"detail": exc.errors()}`. The error is occurring because `exc.errors` is a method, but it is being called as a function with `exc.errors()`. 

The approach for fixing the bug is to remove the parentheses from `exc.errors` to access the method without calling it as a function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
