The issue is related to the incorrect handling of a RequestValidationError in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function in the provided FastAPI code. The bug causes the function to return a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `exc.errors()` as the content for the JSONResponse. The `exc.errors` attribute already contains the error details, and it should be accessed directly rather than calling it as a method.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is attempting to call `exc.errors()` as a method, which is incorrect. Instead, `exc.errors` should be accessed directly to retrieve the error details.

To fix the bug, the `request_validation_exception_handler` function should be modified to access `exc.errors` directly and use it as the content for the JSONResponse.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

With this correction, the function will return a 422 validation error along with an explanation of what was invalid about the request.
