The bug seems to be related to how FastAPI handles validation errors for Constrained Decimals (condecimal) and is causing the server to return a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

The problematic function "request_validation_exception_handler" is taking a Request and a RequestValidationError as input and returning a JSONResponse with the status code and content. The issue seems to be with the way the content is being constructed using "exc.errors()".

It looks like the method exc.errors is being called as a function and should be accessed directly as an attribute instead. Additionally, the error messages in the content are not being constructed correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function as follows:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_messages = []
    for error in exc.errors():
        error_messages.append({"loc": list(error.get("loc", [])), "msg": error.get("msg"), "type": error.get("type")})
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_messages}
    )
```

In this updated code, we are iterating over each error in exc.errors and constructing a list of error messages with the required fields. Then, we are returning a JSONResponse with the status code 422 and the error messages in the content.

This should fix the issue with the incorrect error response and provide the expected behavior of returning a 422 response along with an explanation of what is invalid about the number.
