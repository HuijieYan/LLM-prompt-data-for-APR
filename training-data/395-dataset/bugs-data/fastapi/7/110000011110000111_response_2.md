The error message indicates that the problematic function is `request_validation_exception_handler` in `fastapi/exception_handlers.py`, specifically in the `JSONResponse` call. The error is caused by attempting to serialize a Decimal object, which is not JSON serializable.

The bug is occurring because the `exc.errors()` method is likely returning a Decimal object, which is causing the JSON serialization error. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the content being passed to the `JSONResponse` is JSON serializable.

One approach to fix this bug is to convert the Decimal object to a JSON serializable format before passing it to the `JSONResponse`. We can do this by converting the Decimal object to a string using the `str()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_details = {
        "detail": str(exc.errors())
    }
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content=error_details
    )
```

With this corrected code, we convert the `exc.errors()` to a string using `str()` before passing it to the `JSONResponse`. This ensures that the content is JSON serializable and should resolve the bug.
