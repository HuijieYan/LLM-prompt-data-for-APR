The potential error in the code is with the usage of `exc.errors()` as a method call. However, based on the variable runtime value and type, it is evident that `exc.errors` is a method, and not a property, so it should not be called with `()`. 

The bug occurred because the function is attempting to call a method as if it were a property, which leads to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `exc.errors()` call should be replaced with `exc.errors` to access the method without attempting to call it.

```python
# Corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
