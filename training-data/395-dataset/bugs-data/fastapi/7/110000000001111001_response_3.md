The issue in the provided function is that `exc.errors` is being called as a method instead of being accessed as an attribute. This is indicated by the type of `exc.errors` being `method` instead of the expected error dictionary.

To fix this issue, the `exc.errors` should be accessed directly as an attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
