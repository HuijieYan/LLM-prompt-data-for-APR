The bug in the provided function `request_validation_exception_handler` is that exc.errors is being called as a method instead of being treated as a property.

The reason for the bug is that `exc.errors` is being called as a method which is incorrect. It should be accessed as a property instead.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated as follows:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

By accessing `exc.errors` as a property without calling it as a method, the bug should be fixed. This change will ensure that the error details are correctly included in the response, as expected.
