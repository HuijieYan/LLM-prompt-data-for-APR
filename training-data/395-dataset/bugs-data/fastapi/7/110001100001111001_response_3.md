The issue with the provided function is that `exc.errors` is being treated as a method and not as a data attribute. The correct way to access the `errors` attribute is by calling it as `exc.errors()` in the `content` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

By making this change, the `exc.errors()` method will be correctly called, providing the expected response with the validation error details.

Please ensure to import the required modules and classes from the `fastapi` library in the corrected function.
