The bug in the provided code is that `exc.errors` is being treated as a method and called as a function in the `JSONResponse` content. However, the `exc.errors` is actually a method and should be called as `exc.errors()` to retrieve the value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

In the corrected code, `exc.errors()` is called as a method to retrieve the value, and it is used correctly in the `JSONResponse` content.
