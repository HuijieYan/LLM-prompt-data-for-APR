The bug in the provided function is that `exc.errors` is being treated as a method instead of as an attribute. This is because `exc.errors` is being accessed as a method, but it is actually an attribute containing the error details.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the parentheses after `exc.errors` and treat it as an attribute to access the error details.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors},
    )
```

The parentheses after `exc.errors` have been removed, and now `exc.errors` is being accessed as an attribute to get the error details.
