The error occurs because the "exc.errors()" function inside the request_validation_exception_handler function is returning a Decimal type object, which is not JSON serializable. This is causing the TypeError when trying to convert the Decimal object to JSON. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the content returned by the function is JSON serializable. This can be achieved by converting the Decimal object to a float or int before returning it as part of the JSON response.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_detail = exc.errors()
    
    # Convert Decimal objects to float or int
    def decimal_default(obj):
        if isinstance(obj, Decimal):
            return float(obj) if obj % 1 > 0 else int(obj)
        raise TypeError

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, 
        content={"detail": error_detail},
        default=decimal_default  # Set the default function for JSON serialization
    )
```

By adding a custom default function to the JSONResponse, we can ensure that Decimal objects are properly converted to float or int before trying to serialize them. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring previously.
