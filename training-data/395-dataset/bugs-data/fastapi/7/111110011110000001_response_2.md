The error message from the test function indicates that the response obtained from the `client.post` call is not serializable to JSON due to an object of type Decimal. This suggests that the issue lies in the response construction within the `request_validation_exception_handler` function.

The problematic line is most likely:
```
content={"detail": exc.errors()}
```

It seems that `exc.errors()` returns an object of type Decimal, which is not JSON serializable, causing the TypeError.

To fix this issue, the Decimal object returned by `exc.errors()` needs to be converted to a JSON serializable format. One possible approach could be to convert the Decimal object to a string before returning it as part of the JSON response.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": str(exc.errors())}
    )
```
