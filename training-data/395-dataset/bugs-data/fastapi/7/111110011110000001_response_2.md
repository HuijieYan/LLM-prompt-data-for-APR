The error message in the test function indicates that the response returned from the `client.post` call is causing a `TypeError` because it contains a `Decimal` object that is not JSON serializable. This indicates that the `exc.errors()` call in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function is returning a `Decimal` object, leading to the `TypeError` when trying to build a JSON response.

The bug is most likely occurring in the `exc.errors()` method inside the `request_validation_exception_handler` function. It seems that the `exc.errors()` method is returning a `Decimal` object, which is not JSON serializable and causing the error.

To fix the bug, the `exc.errors()` method should be modified to ensure that it returns JSON serializable content. This can be achieved by converting any non-serializable data types (such as `Decimal` objects) into serializable types (e.g., converting `Decimal` to `float` or `str`) before constructing the response.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    # Convert any non-serializable data types to serializable types
    errors = handle_errors(exc.errors())
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": errors}
    )
```

In the above code, `handle_errors` is a hypothetical function that handles the conversion of non-serializable data types within the `exc.errors()` result. This ensures that the content of the response is JSON serializable and avoids the `TypeError` encountered in the original code.
