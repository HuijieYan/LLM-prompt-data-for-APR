The potential error in the provided function is in the line where the exc.errors() method is being called. The error message is attempting to call the errors method as a function when it is actually a method of the RequestValidationError class.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that exc.errors is being called as a method, leading to the error message `<bound method ValidationError.errors of ...>`

To fix the bug, we need to call exc.errors as a method, and then return the content of the errors.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

# this is the corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

In the corrected code, we import the ValidationError class from pydantic and use it as the type for the exc parameter. This allows us to call the errors method directly on the exc object.
