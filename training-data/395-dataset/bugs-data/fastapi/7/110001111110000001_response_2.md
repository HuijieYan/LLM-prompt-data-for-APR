The error message indicates that there is an issue with serializing a `Decimal` object to JSON, which is likely occurring within the `request_validation_exception_handler` function. This function is supposed to handle request validation exceptions and generate a JSON response, but it currently has an issue with serializing the `exc.errors()` object, which likely contains a `Decimal` type value.

The root cause of this issue is the fact that the `Decimal` type is not natively serializable to JSON. To fix this, the `Decimal` object needs to be converted to a serializable format before it's included in the JSON response.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to convert the `Decimal` object to a serializable format, such as a float or string, before constructing the JSON response. This can be achieved by iterating through the `exc.errors()` object and converting any `Decimal` objects to a serializable format.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
# Corrected request_validation_exception_handler
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_details = exc.errors()
    # Convert any Decimal objects to a serializable format
    for field, error in error_details.items():
        if isinstance(error, Decimal):
            error_details[field] = float(error)  # Convert Decimal to float

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_details}
    )
```
In this corrected code, we iterate through the `error_details` and check if any value is of type `Decimal`. If so, we convert it to a float using `float()`. This ensures that the `Decimal` objects are properly serialized to JSON before constructing the JSON response.
