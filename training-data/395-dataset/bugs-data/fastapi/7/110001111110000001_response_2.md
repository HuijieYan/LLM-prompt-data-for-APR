The test case is sending a JSON payload with an age value of -1.0, which is likely causing the issue. The error message indicates that the Decimal type is not JSON serializable.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line:
```python
content={"detail": exc.errors()}
```
The exc.errors() method is likely returning a Decimal object, which is not JSON serializable.

The bug is occurring because the Decimal type, likely coming from the age value of -1.0 in the JSON payload, is not automatically serialized to a JSON-compatible format.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to handle the serialization of Decimal objects explicitly in the exception handler. This can be done by converting the Decimal object to a built-in Python type (e.g., float or int) before constructing the JSON response.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    def error_handler(o):
        if isinstance(o, Decimal):
            return float(o)  # Convert Decimal to float
        raise TypeError(f'Object of type {o.__class__.__name__} is not JSON serializable')

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}, default=json_enc_handler
    )
```
