1. The test case sends a POST request with a JSON payload containing an age value of -1.0. This is likely to trigger a RequestValidationError because the age is negative.

2. The potential error location is within the `request_validation_exception_handler` function where `exc.errors()` is used. 

3. The error occurs because the `exc.errors()` method returns a Decimal object, which is not JSON serializable.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to convert the Decimal object to a serializable format, such as converting it to a string.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from decimal import Decimal

# Import relevant libraries

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    content = {"detail": str(exc.errors())}
    return JSONResponse(status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content=content)
```
