The error message indicates that the object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable. This error occurs because the content passed to the JSONResponse contains a Decimal object, which the JSON serializer does not know how to handle.

To fix the bug, we need to serialize the Decimal object in a way that is JSON serializable. This can be done by converting the Decimal object to a native Python type before passing it to the JSONResponse.

```python
# Corrected function
from decimal import Decimal
async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    error_details = exc.errors()
    
    # Convert Decimal objects to float for JSON serialization
    for field, value in error_details.items():
        if isinstance(value, Decimal):
            error_details[field] = float(value)
    
    return JSONResponse(status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_details})
```

In the corrected code, we iterate through the error details and convert any Decimal objects to float before passing the content to the JSONResponse. This ensures that the content is JSON serializable and prevents the TypeError from occurring.
