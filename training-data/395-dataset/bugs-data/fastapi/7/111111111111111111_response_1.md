The error message indicates that the issue is related to the serialization of a Decimal object, causing a TypeError because JSON serialization does not support Decimal objects directly.

The bug likely occurs at the line where the content is being created for the JSONResponse. The error info, which includes a Decimal object, is not being serialized properly.

To resolve this issue, the Decimal object needs to be converted to a JSON serializable form before being included in the response content.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_details = []
    for error in exc.errors():
        error_detail = {'loc': error.get('loc'), 'msg': error.get('msg'), 'type': error.get('type')}
        error_ctx = error.get('ctx')
        if error_ctx and 'limit_value' in error_ctx:
            error_detail['ctx'] = {'limit_value': str(error_ctx['limit_value'])}
        error_details.append(error_detail)
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_details}
    )
```

In the corrected code, the Decimal object is converted to a JSON serializable string before being included in the response content. Additionally, the error details are extracted from the ValidationError object and formatted properly to be included in the content of the JSONResponse.
