The error occurs because the 'exc.errors' attribute contains a method as its value, which is not JSON serializable. This is indicated by the error message that states "Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable".

To fix this issue, we need to call the 'exc.errors' method to obtain the actual validation errors in a JSON serializable format.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi import RequestValidationError
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse

# this is the corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    errors = exc.errors()
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": errors}
    )
```

In this corrected code, we call the `exc.errors()` method to obtain the validation errors and then return them in a JSON serializable format. This should resolve the TypeError issue identified in the error message.
