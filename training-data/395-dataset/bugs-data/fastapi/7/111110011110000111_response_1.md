The error message indicates that the issue is with serializing the Decimal type, causing a TypeError. This is likely due to the Decimal type not being JSON serializable.

To fix the issue, we need to convert the Decimal type to a JSON serializable type before returning the JSONResponse.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    # Convert Decimal to float for JSON serialization
    def convert_to_serializable(obj):
        if isinstance(obj, Decimal):
            return float(obj)
        raise TypeError(f'Object of type {obj.__class__.__name__} is not JSON serializable')

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY,
        content={"detail": exc.errors()},
        default=convert_to_serializable
    )
```

In this corrected code, we have added a function called `convert_to_serializable` that checks if the object is a Decimal and converts it to a float. This function is then passed to the `JSONResponse` as the `default` argument, which will be used to serialize the response content.

This fix ensures that Decimals are properly converted to a JSON serializable type, preventing the TypeError and returning the expected 422 response with an explanation of what is invalid.
