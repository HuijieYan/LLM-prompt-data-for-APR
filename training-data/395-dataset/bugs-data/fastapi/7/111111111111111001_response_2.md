The provided error message indicates that the issue is related to serializing a `Decimal` object, which is not JSON serializable. The problematic function is `request_validation_exception_handler` and the potential error location is within the following line:

```python
content={"detail": exc.errors()}
```

The function is trying to return `exc.errors()` as part of the response, and `exc.errors()` appears to be a method based on the input parameter values and types mentioned in the buggy case. This is where the problem arises, because the method itself is not something that can be directly serialized to JSON.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to extract the necessary information from the `exc.errors` method and then structure it as a JSON-serializable object before including it in the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    # Extracting the necessary information and structuring it as a JSON-serializable object
    error_details = [{"loc": error["loc"], "msg": error["msg"]} for error in exc.errors()]
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_details}
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `error_details` list is created by extracting the "loc" and "msg" fields from each error in `exc.errors()`. This list is then included in the response content, providing a JSON-serializable representation of the validation errors.
