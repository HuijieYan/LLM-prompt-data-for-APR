The error message indicates that the object type `Decimal` is not JSON serializable, and this is likely occurring in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function. The `request_validation_exception_handler` function is trying to return a JSONResponse with content that might contain a Decimal type, which is not serializable as per the error message.

The potential error location is likely in the `exc.errors()` method call within the function, which might be returning a Decimal type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the Decimal type is not natively serializable to JSON. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the content being returned as part of the JSONResponse is JSON serializable.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to convert the Decimal type to a serializable data type, such as converting it to a float or string before including it as part of the JSONResponse content.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
        request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    # Convert any Decimal type to float before including it in the JSONResponse content
    def convert_to_json_serializable(obj):
        if isinstance(obj, Decimal):
            return float(obj)
        return obj

    content = {"detail": exc.errors()}
    content = json.dumps(content, default=convert_to_json_serializable)

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content=content
    )
```

In the corrected code, we define a nested function `convert_to_json_serializable` that checks if the object is a Decimal type. If it is, it converts it to a float. Then, we use `json.dumps` with a `default` parameter to convert the content to JSON, ensuring that any Decimal types are converted to float before serialization.
