Potential error location: The error message indicates that a Decimal object is not being serialized to JSON properly, which is likely occurring within the `exc.errors()` method in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The Decimal object returned by `exc.errors()` is not being properly serialized to JSON, resulting in a TypeError when trying to create the response.

Approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Decimal object returned by `exc.errors()` is properly serialized to JSON. This can be achieved by converting the Decimal object to a serializable format, such as a string, before including it in the response content.

Corrected code:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_detail = {}
    for error in exc.errors():
        detail = str(exc.errors()[error])
        if isinstance(exc.errors()[error], Decimal):
            detail = str(float(exc.errors()[error]))
        error_detail[str(error)] = detail
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_detail}
    )
```

In the corrected code:
1. We iterate through each error returned by `exc.errors()` and convert any Decimal objects to strings using `str(float(exc.errors()[error]))` to ensure they are serialized properly to JSON.
2. The error details are stored in a dictionary and used as the content of the JSONResponse.

This should ensure that the Decimal objects are properly serialized to JSON and the bug of returning a 500 error instead of a 422 with an explanation of what was invalid is fixed.
