Potential error location: 
The error seems to be occurring in the "exc.errors()" part of the code. 

Reason for the bug: 
The "errors()" method is likely not a valid method or attribute of the RequestValidationError class, which is causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the documentation or source code for the RequestValidationError class to see if there is a different method or attribute to access the error details.
2. If no alternative method or attribute is available, consider handling the error details in a different way, such as accessing them directly from the exception object.

Corrected code:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY


async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    detail = exc.errors()
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": detail}
    )
```
