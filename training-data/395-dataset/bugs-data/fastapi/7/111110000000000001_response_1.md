Potential error location:
The potential error in the buggy function is with the exc.errors() call. It seems like exc.errors is being treated as a method, but it should be accessed as a property or attribute.

Reason for the bug:
The code is trying to call exc.errors as a method, but it is likely a property or attribute. This is causing a TypeError.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the method call to access exc.errors as a property or attribute instead of a method.
2. Check the documentation or source code for the RequestValidationError class to understand how to access the errors.

Corrected code:
```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
