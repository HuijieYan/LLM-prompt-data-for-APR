The error message indicates that the issue occurs when trying to serialize a Decimal object, which is not JSON serializable, causing a TypeError to be raised. This likely occurs in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, specifically in the content returned by the `JSONResponse` where exc.errors() contains a Decimal object.

To fix this bug, the Decimal object needs to be converted to a JSON serializable type before it is included in the response content.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, status
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
import json

async def custom_json_response(status_code: int, content: dict):
    return JSONResponse(status_code=status_code, content=content)

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    errors = exc.errors()
    # Convert Decimal objects to string for JSON serialization
    content = {"detail": json.loads(errors.json())}
    return await custom_json_response(
        status_code=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content=content
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- We use the `json.loads` method to convert the JSON string representation of the error to a Python dict, including converting Decimal objects to strings.
- Created a separate async function called `custom_json_response` to handle JSON responses in case additional functionality is needed in the future.

This should address the bug and ensure that Decimal objects are properly serialized for the JSON response.
