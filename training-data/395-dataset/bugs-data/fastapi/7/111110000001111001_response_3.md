Problem:
The buggy function is trying to access the 'errors' attribute of the exception 'RequestValidationError' using the `exc.errors()` syntax, which is incorrect.

Reason for the bug:
The `exc.errors` is not a method, it's an attribute that holds the list of errors associated with the exception.

Approach to fix the bug:
We need to access the 'errors' attribute directly without using the `()` syntax, and construct the JSON response with the error details.

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
