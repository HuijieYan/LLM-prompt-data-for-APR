Potential error location: the 'exc.errors()' method is being called without parentheses as 'exc.errors' which suggests that it is trying to access the 'errors' attribute as a method, but the 'errors' attribute itself is not a method and should be accessed as a property. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy code is trying to access the 'errors' attribute of the 'exc' object as a method by using parentheses, which is incorrect syntax. It should be accessed as a property directly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Change 'exc.errors()' to 'exc.errors' in the return statement of the function to access the 'errors' attribute as a property.

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
