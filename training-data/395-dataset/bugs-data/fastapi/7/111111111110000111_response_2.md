The error occurs when trying to return a response with an invalid object type (Decimal) that is not JSON serializable. This issue is likely occurring because the exc.errors() method is returning a Decimal object, which cannot be directly serialized to JSON.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function `request_validation_exception_handler` to ensure that the Decimal object is converted to a JSON serializable format before being returned as part of the response.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.requests import Request
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_messages = exc.errors()
    serializable_errors = {}
    for field, error in error_messages:
        try:
            serializable_errors[field].append(error)
        except KeyError:
            serializable_errors[field] = [error]
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": serializable_errors}
    )
```

This corrected code correctly handles the validation errors returned by the `exc.errors()` method. It creates a dictionary to store the JSON serializable error messages, using the field names as keys and the error messages as values. Then it returns a JSON response with the appropriate HTTP status code (422) and the list of validation errors in a JSON format. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function returns a 422 response code with an explanation of what was invalid as expected.
