The issue seems to be related to the handling of invalid condecimal values, which should result in a 422 response with an explanation of what was invalid, but instead, it causes a 500 internal server error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the content parameter of the JSONResponse, where it is attempting to call exc.errors() which is likely causing the internal server error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the exc.errors() method is likely not the correct way to retrieve the validation errors from the RequestValidationError.

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to access the validation errors using exc.errors() and then construct a response with a 422 status code and the validation errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

In the corrected code, I imported the necessary modules and corrected the function signature and body to handle the RequestValidationError by returning a 422 response with the validation errors extracted from exc.errors(). This should resolve the issue and provide the expected behavior of returning a 422 response along with an explanation of what is invalid about the number.
