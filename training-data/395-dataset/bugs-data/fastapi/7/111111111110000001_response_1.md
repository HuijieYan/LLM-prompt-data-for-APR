The error message indicates that the Decimal type being returned is not JSON serializable, which is likely causing the bug in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function.

The reason behind this bug is that the `exc.errors()` method is likely returning error messages that include a Decimal type, which is not directly serializable to JSON.

To fix this bug, one approach would be to convert the Decimal type to a serializable type before creating the JSON response. This can be done by converting the Decimal type to a float or string.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_detail = exc.errors()
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY,
        content={"detail": error_detail},
    )
```
