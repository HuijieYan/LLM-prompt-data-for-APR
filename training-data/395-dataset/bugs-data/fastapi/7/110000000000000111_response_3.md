Potential error location: 
The error seems to be in the `exc.errors()` part, which is likely not the correct way to retrieve error details from the RequestValidationError object.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `exc.errors()` call is likely not a valid way to retrieve error details from the RequestValidationError object. This is causing the function to return a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `exc.errors()` method correctly to retrieve error details from the RequestValidationError object.

Corrected code:
```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```
This corrected code uses the proper method to retrieve error details from the `RequestValidationError` object and returns a 422 validation error along with an explanation of what was invalid.
