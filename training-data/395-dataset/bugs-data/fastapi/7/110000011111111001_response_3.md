The error message indicates that there is an issue with serializing the 'Decimal' object, which is likely related to the exc.errors() method in the original buggy function.

The exc.errors() method returns a list of errors as a method object, which cannot be serialized to JSON. This is the reason behind the bug.

To fix this bug, you can modify the buggy function to extract the error details from the method object and return a JSON-serializable format. Specifically, you can return a list of dictionaries representing the errors, making sure to convert any non-JSON serializable objects (such as 'Decimal') to their string representations.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    errors = []
    for error in exc.errors():
        error_detail = {
            "loc": error["loc"],
            "msg": error["msg"],
            "type": error["type"],
            "ctx": {key: str(value) if isinstance(value, Decimal) else value for key, value in error["ctx"].items()}
        }
        errors.append(error_detail)
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": errors}
    )
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the errors returned by exc.errors() and create a list of dictionaries representing each error. We also ensure that any non-JSON serializable objects (e.g., Decimal) are converted to their string representations using str().
