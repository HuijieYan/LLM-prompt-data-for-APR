The bug seems to be occurring in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, which is meant to handle RequestValidationErrors by returning a 422 status code along with an explanation of what is invalid. However, the bug causes a 500 internal server error to be returned when an invalid condecimal is sent to a FastAPI service.

The reason behind this bug is likely that the `exc.errors()` method is being called incorrectly, resulting in the unexpected behavior. The `exc.errors` attribute appears to be a method, but it is being called as if it were a property. This is leading to the incorrect response being sent back to the client.

To fix the bug, the `exc.errors()` call should be replaced with `exc.errors` to correctly access the errors attribute of the RequestValidationError. Additionally, the content of the response should be updated to include an explanation of the validation error.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import RequestValidationError

# Corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_messages = []
    for error in exc.errors():
        error_messages.append({
            "loc": error.get("loc"),
            "msg": error.get("msg"),
            "type": error.get("type"),
            "ctx": error.get("ctx")
        })
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": "Validation error", "errors": error_messages}
    )
```

This corrected function now properly accesses the `exc.errors` attribute to retrieve the validation errors and constructs a JSON response with a 422 status code and an explanation of the validation error.
