The issue seems to be related to the response status code not being correctly set when an invalid condecimal is sent to a FastAPI service. This results in a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

It appears that the issue lies in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, specifically in how the `exc.errors` are being handled. The `exc.errors` returns a method object, but it should be returning the actual error content.

To fix this issue, the `exc.errors` method should be called to retrieve the error content, which should then be passed to the JSONResponse, along with the HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY status code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

With this correction, the `exc.errors()` method is now properly called to retrieve the error content, and a 422 status code is set in the JSONResponse. This should address the issue of returning a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.
