The issue with the provided function is that it's trying to call `exc.errors()` as a method, but `exc.errors` is not a method, it's an attribute.

As a result, when the function tries to access `exc.errors()` as a method, it throws an AttributeError.

To fix this, we need to access `exc.errors` directly without the parentheses.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
