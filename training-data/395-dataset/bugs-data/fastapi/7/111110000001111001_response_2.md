The bug in the provided function is that `exc.errors` is being called as a method instead of being used as an attribute. This is causing the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to access `exc.errors` as an attribute to get the error details.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
