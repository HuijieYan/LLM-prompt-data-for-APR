The error occurs because the `exc.errors` is a method and the TypeError is raised because the Decimal type within `exc.errors` is not JSON serializable. 

To fix this bug, we need to call the `exc.errors` method and handle the response appropriately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

In this corrected function, the `ValidationError` is imported from `pydantic` and used as the type for the `exc` parameter. The `exc.errors()` method is called and used as the content for the JSONResponse.

This change will handle the ValidationError appropriately and return a 422 response with an explanation of what is invalid about the input.
