The error occurs in the line `content={"detail": exc.errors()}` where the `exc.errors` method is being called incorrectly.

The bug occurs because the `exc.errors` should be accessed as a property, not called as a method. This is causing the TypeError when trying to serialize the response to JSON.

To fix this bug, the `exc.errors` method should be changed to `exc.errors` to access it as a property.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

# corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
