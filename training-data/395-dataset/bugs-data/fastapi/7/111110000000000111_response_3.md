Potential error location:
The status_code in the JSONResponse is set to HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, which should return a 422 error, but the content only includes a generic "detail" field without providing specific information about the validation error.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the "exc.errors()" method does not provide the specific details of the validation error.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the "exc.errors()" method properly to retrieve the specific validation errors.
2. Include the specific validation errors in the content of the JSONResponse to provide a more detailed explanation of the validation error.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```
