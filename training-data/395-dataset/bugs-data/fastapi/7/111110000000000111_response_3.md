Potential error location within the function:
The issue seems to be with the `exc.errors()` method. It looks like `exc` is an instance of `RequestValidationError` and `errors` is likely a property or method of `RequestValidationError` class. However, it seems that `errors` is being treated as a method and called with parentheses, which is incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `exc.errors()` method call is likely causing the bug as it is being used incorrectly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the documentation or source code of the `RequestValidationError` class to understand how to access validation error information.
2. Possibly use `exc.errors` instead of `exc.errors()` if `errors` is a property of `RequestValidationError` class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
