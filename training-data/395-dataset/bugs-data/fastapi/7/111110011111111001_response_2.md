The error message provided shows that the issue is related to the serialization of a Decimal object, which is not JSON serializable.

Upon reviewing the provided function, it seems that the main issue lies in the line:
```python
content={"detail": exc.errors()}
```
The `exc.errors` seems to be a method rather than an attribute, and the result of calling this method might not be serializable.

The potential reason behind the bug is the incorrect usage of `exc.errors()` as a method call, which might be generating a non-serializable result.

To fix this bug, the function should access the `errors` attribute directly instead of calling it as a method. Additionally, the error message they are trying to include might also need to be altered to ensure proper JSON serialization.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=422, content={"detail": exc.errors},
    )
```
In this corrected code, `exc.errors` is accessed directly without the method call, and the status code is also directly provided as `422` instead of referencing `HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY`.
