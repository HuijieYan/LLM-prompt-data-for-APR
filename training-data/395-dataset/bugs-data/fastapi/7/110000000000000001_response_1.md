Potential error location: In the line "content={"detail": exc.errors()}"


Reason for the bug: The "exc.errors()" is not a method, so it will cause a TypeError.


Approach for fixing the bug: Replace "exc.errors()" with "exc.errors". "errors" should be accessed as an attribute of the exception object "exc" instead of being called as a method.


Corrected code:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
