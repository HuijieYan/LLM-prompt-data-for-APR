The error in the provided function is that `exc.errors()` is being treated as a method call, but it is actually a property or attribute of the `exc` object. 

To fix this, we need to remove the parentheses after `exc.errors` to access the property instead of trying to call it as a method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
