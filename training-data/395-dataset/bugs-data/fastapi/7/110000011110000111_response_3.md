The test case provided is trying to send a POST request to a FastAPI server with a JSON payload containing an invalid age value (-1.0), expecting a 422 status code in response. However, it is encountering a TypeError due to the invalid handling of the decimal constraint.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that tries to serialize the exception's errors using JSON response. The issue occurs because the Decimal value encountered is not being properly handled during serialization.

The bug occurs because the Decimal value is not being handled properly during serialization, causing a TypeError and resulting in a 500 server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what is invalid.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the Decimal value properly during serialization to ensure that it is JSON serializable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse


async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    error_details = []
    for error in exc.errors():
        error_details.append({"loc": error["loc"], "msg": error["msg"], "type": error["type"]})
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY,
        content={"detail": error_details}
    )
```

With this correction, the problematic function now properly handles the serialization of exception's errors and returns a 422 status code with an explanation of what is invalid in the response.
