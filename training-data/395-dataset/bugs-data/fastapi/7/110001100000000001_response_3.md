Potential error location: The issue might be with the `exc.errors()` as it is being called as a method, but it should be accessed as a property or attribute.

Reason behind the bug: The `exc.errors()` is being called as a method, but it should be accessed as a property or attribute of the `RequestValidationError`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Access the `exc.errors` property directly instead of calling it as a method.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

# corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
