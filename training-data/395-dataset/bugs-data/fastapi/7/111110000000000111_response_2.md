The bug is occurring in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, where it is returning a status code of 422, but the content is missing an explanation of what was invalid.

The reason for the bug is that the `exc.errors()` method is being called without parenthesis to invoke it as a function, causing the TypeError. Additionally, the explanation of what was invalid is not being included in the response content.

To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `exc.errors` method and include the explanation in the response content.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_messages = exc.errors()
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": "Validation error", "errors": error_messages}
    )
```
