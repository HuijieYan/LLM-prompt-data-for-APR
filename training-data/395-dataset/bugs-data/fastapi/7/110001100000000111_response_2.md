The potential error in the code is with the `exc.errors()` call. The `RequestValidationError` object does not have a method called `errors()`. Instead, we should use `exc.errors()` to access the validation errors.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the incorrect method is being called on the `RequestValidationError` object, leading to an internal server error (status code 500) instead of the expected validation error (status code 422).

To fix this bug, we need to update the `request_validation_exception_handler` function to correctly access the validation errors from the `RequestValidationError` object and return a `422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY` status code along with an explanation of what was invalid.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.requests import Request

async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY,
        content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```
