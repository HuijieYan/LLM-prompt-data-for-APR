The bug in the given function is that it is trying to call the "errors" method on the "exc" object, which is not the correct way to access the errors in the RequestValidationError.

The reason for the bug is that the function is treating "exc.errors" as a method, but it is actually a property or attribute of the RequestValidationError object. 

To fix this bug, we need to access the "errors" attribute directly from the "exc" object without calling it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

In the corrected code, we are accessing the "errors" attribute directly from the "exc" object without calling it as a method. This will fix the bug and ensure that the correct error details are returned in the JSON response.
