The issue with the provided function is that it is trying to access the errors attribute of the exc object as a method, which is causing the error. The exc object is of type RequestValidationError and does not have an errors() method.

To fix this issue, we need to access the errors attribute directly without trying to call it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

By directly accessing the errors attribute of the exc object without trying to call it as a method, we resolve the issue and return the errors as expected.
