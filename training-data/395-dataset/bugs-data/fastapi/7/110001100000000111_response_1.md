The issue seems to be related to the handling of invalid constrained decimals in the FastAPI service. When an invalid condecimal is sent, the service returns a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what is invalid.

Upon analyzing the code, the potential error location within the problematic function is the content parameter of the JSONResponse, specifically the exc.errors() method call.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the exc.errors() method is being called without considering the structure of the RequestValidationError's errors. This leads to an unexpected server error response instead of a proper 422 validation error response.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the RequestValidationError and construct an appropriate response with a 422 status code and an explanation of the validation error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

In the corrected code, we directly use the exc.errors attribute to extract the validation errors and include them in the JSON response content with a 422 status code. This should fix the bug and ensure that proper validation error responses are returned for invalid constrained decimals.
