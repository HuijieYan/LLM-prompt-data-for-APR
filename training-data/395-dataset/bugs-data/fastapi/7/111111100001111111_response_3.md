The bug seems to be occurring in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, which is meant to handle RequestValidationError by returning a JSONResponse with a status code of 422 and a content detailing the validation errors.

Based on the input and expected variable values/types, it seems that the bug is in the way the `exc.errors()` method is being called to retrieve the validation errors. The method is being incorrectly called with parentheses, while it should be accessed as a property.

This bug is causing the function to return a 500 internal server error instead of the expected 422 validation error, as reported in the GitHub issue. The TypeError mentioned in the issue is likely due to the incorrect method call.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the parentheses when accessing the `errors` method of the `exc` object. This should provide the correct validation errors to be included in the response content.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected 422 response along with an explanation of what is invalid about the number in case of validation errors.
