The issue seems to be related to the handling of validation errors for decimal constraints in the FastAPI service. The problem occurs when an invalid constrained decimal is sent to the service, causing it to return a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

The buggy function `request_validation_exception_handler` is responsible for handling the validation errors, specifically the `RequestValidationError` type. The bug likely occurs when this function is called with an `exc` object of type `RequestValidationError` and the `exc.errors()` method is called to fetch the validation errors.

The bug occurs because `exc.errors()` is called as a method, but it should be accessed as a property or attribute to get the validation errors. This results in the incorrect handling of the validation errors and the erroneous 500 internal server error response.

To fix the bug, the `exc.errors()` method should be replaced with `exc.errors` to correctly access the validation errors property.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
