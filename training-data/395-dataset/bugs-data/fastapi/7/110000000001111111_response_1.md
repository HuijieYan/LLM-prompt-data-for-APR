The bug is occurring because the `exc.errors` is being called as a method when it should be accessed as a property to retrieve the error messages. The `exc.errors` property is expected to return a list of errors, but currently, it is being called as a method which causes the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `exc.errors` to `exc.errors` to correctly access the error messages.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

With this fix, the `exc.errors` property will be correctly accessed to retrieve the error messages, and the function should work as expected, returning a 422 status code along with an explanation of what is invalid about the request.
