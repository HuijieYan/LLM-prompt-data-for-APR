The issue in the provided function is that 'exc.errors()' is being called as a method, but it should actually be accessed as a property. This is evident from the input parameter runtime value and type where exc.errors is shown as a method.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to access 'exc.errors' as a property rather than a method.

```python
# Corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
