It seems the issue with the `include_router` method is that it is calling a method `add_api_route` with more parameters than it takes. The `add_api_route` method only takes `path` and `endpoint` as parameters, but the `include_router` method is passing additional parameters to it.

To fix this issue, the `include_router` method needs to be modified to only pass the required parameters to the `add_api_route` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(prefix + route.path, route.endpoint)
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(prefix + route.path, route.endpoint)
```
