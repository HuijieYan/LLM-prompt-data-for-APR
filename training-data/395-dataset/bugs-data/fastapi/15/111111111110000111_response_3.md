The bug is related to how websocket routes are being handled when used with an APIRouter. The issue is occurring because the `include_router` method is not correctly handling adding websocket routes from the included router. The `include_router` method is responsible for adding routes from the included router to the main router.

The problem is occurring in the `include_router` method where it is trying to add websocket routes from the included router to the main router. The `add_api_route` method within the `include_router` method is not designed to handle websocket routes, which results in the 403 forbidden error.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_route` method should be modified to handle websocket routes properly. We can create a new method `add_websocket_route` and call it in the `include_router` method for websocket routes, while calling the existing `add_api_route` method for regular API routes.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebsocketRoute):  # handle websocket routes
            self.add_websocket_route(  # call new method to handle websocket routes
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

By adding a new condition to handle websocket routes and calling a dedicated method to handle them, the bug should be fixed and websocket routes from included routers should work correctly.
