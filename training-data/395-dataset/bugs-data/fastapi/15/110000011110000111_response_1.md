The provided code is a FastAPI route that uses a WebSocket with a test function. The error message indicates that there may be an issue with the WebSocket connection when using the `websocket_connect` method from the TestClient class.

The potential error location within the `include_router` method could be related to the WebSocket functionality or how the WebSocket route is being included in the APIRouter.

The bug occurs because the WebSocket route is not properly defined within the APIRouter, causing the WebSocket connections to fail when trying to connect to the route.

To fix this bug, you should ensure that WebSocket routes are properly handled when included in an APIRouter. This may involve modifying the way WebSocket routes are defined within the APIRouter and ensuring that the WebSocket connections are properly established.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, WebSocket

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint
            )
```

By using the `add_api_websocket_route` and `add_websocket_route` methods from FastAPI, the WebSocket routes will be properly included in the APIRouter and can be accessed without any issues.
