The potential error in the `include_router` function is that it is trying to call `self.add_api_route` with more parameters than it is defined to accept. The `add_api_route` method only accepts `path` and `endpoint` as parameters, but the `include_router` function is trying to pass additional parameters such as `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, etc.

The bug occurred because the `include_router` function is trying to add additional route configurations to the `APIRouter` by iterating through the routes of the `router` parameter and assigning the prefixed route configurations to the `APIRouter`. However, in the process, it's trying to pass more parameters than the `add_api_route` function accepts.

To fix the bug, we need to either modify the `add_api_route` function to accept these additional parameters or remove the unnecessary parameters being passed in the `include_router` function. 

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                # Assuming add_api_route now accepts the additional parameters
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
              # Add handling for routing.Route
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

In this corrected code, I've assumed that the `add_api_route` function now accepts the additional parameters being passed from the `include_router` function. If not, you'll need to update the `add_api_route` function to accept these parameters.
