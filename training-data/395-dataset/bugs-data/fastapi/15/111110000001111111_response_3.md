The issue seems to be with the `include_router` function, specifically with the handling of `WebSocketRoute` objects. It seems that when the `hello` function is defined in the main FastAPI app, it works fine. But when it is moved to `APIRouter`, it fails to work properly.

The issue occurs because the `add_api_route` method does not support `WebSocketRoute` objects. It currently only supports `APIRoute` and `routing.Route` objects.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `add_api_route` method to support `WebSocketRoute` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function in the `APIRouter` class:

```python
from starlette.routing import Route
from starlette.endpoints import WebSocketRoute

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, **kwargs) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...

    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name
                )
```

In the corrected code, we have added a new method called `add_websocket_route`, which will handle the `WebSocketRoute` objects. Additionally, in the `include_router` method, we have added an `elif` block to check for `WebSocketRoute` objects and call the `add_websocket_route` method accordingly.
