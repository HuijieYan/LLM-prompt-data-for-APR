The bug is occurring in the `include_router` function. It is failing to properly handle websocket routes when included in an APIRouter object.

The reason behind the bug is that the `include_router` function is not correctly adding the websocket routes to the main FastAPI object. When the `add_api_route` function is called inside the `include_router` function, it is not handling the websocket routes correctly.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` function needs to check for websocket routes and handle them properly when including the router in the main FastAPI app.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, **kwargs) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                if isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                    self.websocket_route(
                        prefix + route.path,
                        route.endpoint,
                        name=route.name,
                    )
                else:
                    self.add_api_route(
                        prefix + route.path,
                        route.endpoint,
                        response_model=route.response_model,
                        status_code=route.status_code,
                        tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                        summary=route.summary,
                        description=route.description,
                        response_description=route.response_description,
                        deprecated=route.deprecated,
                        methods=route.methods,
                        operation_id=route.operation_id,
                        include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                        content_type=route.content_type,
                        name=route.name,
                    )
```

In this corrected code, the `include_router` function now checks for websocket routes and handles them using the `websocket_route` method, and for other routes, it uses the `add_api_route` method. This way, both websocket and non-websocket routes will work correctly when included in the main FastAPI object.
