The bug seems to be in the `include_router` method of the class. When the `prefix` is not empty, the function is adding the `prefix` to the `route.path` which is not the expected behavior. It should only add the `prefix` to the `route.path` if the route is of type `APIRoute`.

The bug is causing the websocket connections to fail in the test functions because the path is not correctly constructed.

To fix the bug, the function should only add the `prefix` to the `route.path` if the route is of type `APIRoute`, otherwise, it should use the original `route.path`.

Below is the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
from typing import List
from fastapi import APIRouter, Request
from starlette.websockets import WebSocket
from starlette.routing import Route as RoutingRoute
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute

class ModifiedAPIRouter(APIRouter):
    def include_router(self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, RoutingRoute):
                self.add_route(
                    route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

With this corrected code, the `prefix` will only be added to the `route.path` if the route is of type `APIRoute`, and it will use the original `route.path` if the route is of type `RoutingRoute`. This should fix the bug and allow the websocket connections to work as expected in the test functions.
