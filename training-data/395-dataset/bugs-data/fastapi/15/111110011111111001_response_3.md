The function `include_router` has a bug. It calls `self.add_api_route` with more arguments than the function signature specifies. This should result in a `TypeError` when the function is called. The bug is likely causing the `WebSocketDisconnect` error in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the extra arguments passed to `self.add_api_route` need to be removed. The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
