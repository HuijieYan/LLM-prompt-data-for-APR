This bug occurs because the add_api_route function is being called with more parameters than it expects. The include_router function is trying to add API routes by calling the add_api_route function with incorrect parameters.

To fix this bug, the include_router function should be updated to only pass the required parameters to the add_api_route function. The unnecessary parameters should be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the include_router function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In this corrected code, the unnecessary parameters such as response_model, status_code, tags, summary, description, response_description, deprecated, methods, operation_id, include_in_schema, and content_type have been removed from the call to add_api_route. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works as intended.
