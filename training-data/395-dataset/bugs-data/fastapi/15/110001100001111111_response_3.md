The issue seems to be with the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class where the WebSocket routes are not properly added when using the `include_router` method to include the routes from the `APIRouter` instance into the main `FastAPI` app.

The bug occurs because the `include_router` method is not correctly handling WebSocket routes. At the moment, it only adds HTTP routes when including a router.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `include_router` method to also handle WebSocket routes. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
                # Add additional parameter for WebSocket routes
                is_websocket=route.is_websocket
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected code, a new parameter `is_websocket` is added to the `add_api_route` method, which specifies whether the route is a WebSocket route or not. This will allow the WebSocket routes to be correctly added when including a router using the `include_router` method.

This change will ensure that the WebSocket routes are properly added when including a router into the main `FastAPI` app, and the issue with WebSocket routes not working on the included router should be resolved.
