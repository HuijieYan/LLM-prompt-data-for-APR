The error message indicates that the websocket routes are not working properly when used on an APIRouter object, leading to a WebSocketDisconnect error.

The issue seems to be related to the way websocket routes are handled in the APIRouter object. It appears that the APIRouter is not handling the websocket routes correctly, resulting in the WebSocketDisconnect error.

To fix the bug, the handling of websocket routes within the APIRouter needs to be corrected. This might involve updating the include_router function to ensure that websocket routes are properly added to the APIRouter and that they function as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the include_router function:

```python
from typing import List
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi import APIRouter

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if route.websocket:
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        else:
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected function, we've included a check for websocket routes using the `route.websocket` attribute. We then use `add_websocket_route` to handle websocket routes specifically, and continue to use `add_api_route` for regular routes.

This should resolve the issue with websocket routes not working properly when used within an APIRouter object.
