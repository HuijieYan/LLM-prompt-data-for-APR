The error is occurring in the `client.websocket_connect` call in the test functions. This suggests that the bug is likely in the implementation of the `include_router` method, which is used to add routes to a router with a specified prefix in FastAPI.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect implementation of the `include_router` method, particularly in the `for` loop where routes from the `router` object are being added to the current router using the `add_api_route` method. The error message also suggests that there might be an issue related to connection closing in WebSocket connections.

To fix this bug, the `include_router` method should be modified to properly handle the addition of routes from the `router` object to the current router, taking into account the prefix that needs to be added to the paths of the routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

By making the `tags` argument optional and updating its type hint to `Optional[List[str]]`, and providing the corrected implementation, the `include_router` method should now be able to correctly add routes from the `router` object to the current router with the specified prefix. This should resolve the issues encountered in the test functions.
