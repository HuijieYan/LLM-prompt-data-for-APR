Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the conditional statements where the routes are being checked for their type.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling different types of routes, such as `APIRoute` and `routing.Route`. The conditions and attributes for each type of route need to be handled differently.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 

1. Handle each type of route separately by using `if-else` statements to differentiate between `APIRoute` and `routing.Route`.
2. For `APIRoute`, use the `add_api_route` method with the appropriate attributes, and for `routing.Route`, use the `add_route` method with the corresponding attributes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from typing import List
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute, Route

# corrected function
def include_router(
    self, router: APIRouter, *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
