The bug is occurring in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. When trying to include a WebSocketRoute from another APIRouter, it is causing a 403 error.

The reason for this bug is that the `add_api_route` method is not designed to handle WebSocketRoutes, which is why it is throwing a 403 error.

To fix this bug, we need to create a new method specifically for adding WebSocketRoutes to the APIRouter. This method will handle WebSocketRoutes differently from regular APIRoutes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected code, we added a new `add_websocket_route` method to handle WebSocketRoutes separately. We also modified the `include_router` method to check for the type of route being added and then call the appropriate method to handle it. This should resolve the issue of WebSocketRoutes not working properly in the APIRouter.
