Describe the bug
Websocket routes appear to only work on the main FastAPI object, not on APIRouter objects. When the same function is copied from a FastAPI object to an APIRouter object instead of working properly it just throws a 403.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

The following works as expected:
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.websocket_route("/hello")
async def hello(websocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    await websocket.send_text("Hello!")
    response = await websocket.receive_text()
    print(response)
    await websocket.close()
    print("Closed")
Moving hello to an APIRouter fails:
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import other
app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(other.router)
# other.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter()

@router.websocket_route("/routerhello")
async def hello(websocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    await websocket.send_text("Router Hello!")
    response = await websocket.receive_text()
    print(response)
    await websocket.close()
    print("Router Closed")
Expected behavior
I expect a websocket route to work on both a FastAPI and APIRouter object.
