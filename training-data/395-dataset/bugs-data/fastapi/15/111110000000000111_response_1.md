Potential error location: The `include_router` function is not correctly handling websocket routes when included from a FastAPI app into an APIRouter object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `include_router` function is not correctly handling the websocket routes from the other APIRouter object. It is not correctly transferring the websocket routes to the main FastAPI app.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `include_router` function needs to correctly handle websocket routes when included from an APIRouter object into the main FastAPI app.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if route.websocket:
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
