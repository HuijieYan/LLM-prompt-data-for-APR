The error occurs in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The method iterates through each route in the `router` passed as a parameter and tries to call the `add_api_route` method for each route. However, the `add_api_route` method is not designed to accept all the parameters passed in the `include_router` method.

To fix this bug, you need to update the `include_router` method to remove the additional parameters being passed to the `add_api_route` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
This corrected code removes the additional parameters being passed to the `add_api_route` method, aligning it with the method's signature.
