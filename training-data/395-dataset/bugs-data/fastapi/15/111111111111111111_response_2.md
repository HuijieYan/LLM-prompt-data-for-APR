The problem seems to be in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. When trying to handle websocket connections using the `include_router` method, it raises a 403 error, which indicates a permissions issue.

The websocket endpoint is defined inside `APIRouter` and needs to be properly routed by the `include_router` method to avoid the 403 error.

To fix this bug, you need to modify the `include_router` method to properly handle websocket routes when including routers in FastAPI. Ensure that the websocket routes are properly linked and registered with the main FastAPI app.

Here's the corrected `include_router` method for the `APIRouter` class in FastAPI:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.routes.append(route)
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.routes.append(route)
```

This corrected code ensures that the routes from the included router are properly added to the main router, allowing websocket connections to be properly routed and handled. After applying this fix, the `include_router` method should work as expected, and the websocket routes should function properly when included in APIRouter objects in FastAPI.
