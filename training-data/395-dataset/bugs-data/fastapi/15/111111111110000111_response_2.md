The issue stems from the `include_router` function within the `APIRouter` class. The issue itself arises from using the `self.add_api_route` function within the `include_router` function. The `add_api_route` function in the `APIRouter` class doesn't seem to have all the required parameters to handle a WebSocket route.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the `add_api_route` function in the `APIRouter` class to handle WebSocket routes properly. Additionally, the `include_router` function itself needs to be modified to correctly incorporate the routes from the provided `APIRouter` and handle WebSocket routes as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function and an updated `add_api_route` function:

```python
# corrected version of include_router function
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # other functions go here

    # corrected include_router function
    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                    websocket=route.websocket  # include the websocket parameter
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )

    # corrected version of add_api_route function
    def add_api_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, *, response_model: Any = None,
        status_code: int = 200, tags: List[str] = None, summary: str = None,
        description: str = None, response_description: str = None, deprecated: bool = False,
        methods: List[str] = None, operation_id: str = None, include_in_schema: bool = True,
        content_type: ContentType = None, name: str = None, websocket: bool = False  # add websocket parameter
    ) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

In the corrected code, the `include_router` function now handles the WebSocket routes correctly by including the `websocket` parameter when adding a route. Additionally, the `add_api_route` function has been updated to include the `websocket` parameter and improve compatibility with WebSocket routes.
