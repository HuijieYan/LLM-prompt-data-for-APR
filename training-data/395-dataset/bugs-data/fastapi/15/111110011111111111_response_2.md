Based on the provided information and the error messages from the test functions, it seems that the issue lies with the `include_router` method in the `APIRouter` class. The function `include_router` is supposed to iterate through the routes of the given `router` and add them to the current `APIRouter` instance.

The error messages indicate that the WebSocket routes are not working as expected when being included via the `include_router` method. This means that there is an issue with how the WebSocket routes are being added to the `APIRouter`.

The problem with the code seems to be that the `include_router` method is attempting to add WebSocket routes using the `add_api_route` method, which is designed for standard HTTP routes, leading to a 403 error.

To fix this issue, a new method specifically for WebSocket routes should be added to the `APIRouter` class. This method should be responsible for adding WebSocket routes to the router. Let's call this method `add_websocket_route`. It would be implemented similarly to `add_api_route`, but designed to handle WebSocket routes specifically.

Below is the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name
            )
        elif isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        else:
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In this corrected code, `add_websocket_route` is a hypothetical new method that should be added to the `APIRouter` class. This method should handle adding WebSocket routes specifically, compared to the existing `add_api_route` method used for HTTP routes.
