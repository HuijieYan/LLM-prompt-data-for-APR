The error message indicates that the WebSocket connection is being closed immediately after being established, which is likely due to an issue with the `include_router` method in the `APIRouter` class.

The issue seems to be related to the `prefix` argument handling. The route `path` should be prefixed with the provided `prefix`, but it seems that the prefix is not being properly added to the path of the route when using the `websocket_connect` method.

To address this issue, the `prefix` should be properly handled when adding routes from the included router, and it should be integrated into the `path` of the route.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method in the `APIRouter` class:

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute

class APIRouter:
    # ... other methods ...

    def add_api_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, **kwargs
    ) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'

        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                route_path = router.prefix + route.path if prefix else route.path
                self.add_api_route(
                    route_path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                route_path = router.prefix + route.path if prefix else route.path
                self.add_route(
                    route_path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

In the corrected code, the `prefix` is integrated into the `path` of each route, ensuring that the routes from the included router are properly prefixed with the provided `prefix`. This should resolve the issue with the WebSocket connection.

After implementing this correction, the two test functions should execute without errors and establish the WebSocket connections as expected.
