The error message indicates that there is an issue with creating a WebSocket connection in the test function. This suggests that the problem is with the `include_router` method in the source code provided.

Upon analyzing the `include_router` method, the issue seems to be with the call to `self.add_api_route` and `self.add_route`. The `add_api_route` method should be used, but it's missing the required parameters for the function.

The reason behind the bug is that `self.add_api_route` function is missing the required parameters, leading to a failure when creating a WebSocket connection.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` method should pass only the necessary parameters to `self.add_api_route`.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
```
