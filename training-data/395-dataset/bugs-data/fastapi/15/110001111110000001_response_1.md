The error occurs when the `client.websocket_connect` method is called in the test function with the specified URL. This method tries to establish a websocket connection with the specified URL and raises an error when the connection is closed with the code 1000.

The bug in the code is within the `include_router` method, specifically in the line where it iterates over the routes of the router and calls `self.add_api_route` and `self.add_route`. The issue seems to be that `self.add_api_route` does not accept the parameters being passed to it, as there are a lot of additional parameters that are not defined for this method.

To fix this bug, the `include_router` method should be modified to use the correct parameters when calling the `add_api_route` or `add_route` methods.

        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, methods = None, include_in_schema = None, 
        name = None

    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:

        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
