The potential error in the `include_router` function is that when calling `self.add_api_route`, it's passing more arguments than the function signature allows. This is causing the function call to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra arguments passed to `self.add_api_route` and ensure that the function call matches the function signature.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```
