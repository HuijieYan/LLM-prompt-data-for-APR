The bug is likely in the `include_router` function of the `APIRouter` class. This function attempts to add routes from the `router` parameter to itself, using the `add_api_route` method. However, there seems to be a mismatch between the number of arguments being passed to `add_api_route` and the number of parameters it expects. This is likely causing the bug.

The reason for the bug is that the `include_router` function is not using the correct arguments when calling `add_api_route`. The `add_api_route` method is being called with the incorrect parameters, including `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, `description`, `response_description`, `deprecated`, `methods`, `operation_id`, `include_in_schema`, `content_type`, and `name`. The function signatures for `add_api_route` should be modified to accept these parameters.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_route` method needs to be updated to accept these additional parameters. The method signature should be modified to include all these parameters. Additionally, the `include_router` function should be updated to call `add_api_route` with the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_route` and `include_router` functions:

```python
def add_api_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, **kwargs
) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                **{
                    "response_model": route.response_model,
                    "status_code": route.status_code,
                    "tags": (route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    "summary": route.summary,
                    "description": route.description,
                    "response_description": route.response_description,
                    "deprecated": route.deprecated,
                    "methods": route.methods,
                    "operation_id": route.operation_id,
                    "include_in_schema": route.include_in_schema,
                    "content_type": route.content_type,
                    "name": route.name,
                }
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

With the updated `add_api_route` method and the `include_router` function, the bug should be fixed, and the WebSocket routes should work on both FastAPI and APIRouter objects.
