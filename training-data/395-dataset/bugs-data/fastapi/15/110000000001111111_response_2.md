The issue appears to be related to the use of the `websocket_route` function inside the `include_router` method of the APIRouter class. The APIRouter class is a sub-class of APIRoute, and it may not inherit all the properties and methods of the main FastAPI class that includes websocket support. This could be the reason why the websocket routes only work on the main FastAPI object and not on APIRouter objects.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to ensure that the APIRouter class effectively supports the websocket routes. This might involve modifying the underlying implementation of the APIRouter class to include support for the websocket routes. Another approach could be to handle websocket routes differently when used within the APIRouter, for example by using a different method to define and handle websocket routes within the APIRouter.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):  # Change to WebSocketRoute
            self.router.websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name,
            )
        else:
            self.add_route(  # Handle other routes like HTTP routes
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In this corrected code, the WebSocketRoute class from the routing module is properly handled when iterating through the routes of the router. It uses the `websocket_route` method on the APIRouter to properly handle the websocket routes within the APIRouter.
