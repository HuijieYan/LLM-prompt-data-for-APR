Potential error location: The `add_api_route` method is called with incorrect parameters, as it is missing the required parameter `response_model`.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `add_api_route` method is being called with missing parameters, specifically `response_model`, which is required based on the function signature.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add the missing `response_model` parameter to the `add_api_route` method call.
2. Ensure that all the required parameters are provided when calling the `add_api_route` method.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_15/fastapi/routing.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, response_model: Any, status_code: int, tags: List[str], summary: str, description: str, response_description: str, deprecated: bool, methods: List[str], operation_id: str, include_in_schema: bool, content_type: Any, name: str) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                route.response_model,
                route.status_code,
                (route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                route.summary,
                route.description,
                route.response_description,

                route.methods,
                route.operation_id,
                route.include_in_schema,
                route.content_type,
                route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
