The issue seems to be related to the use of websocket routes on the APIRouter object, as they are not working as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `include_router` method, specifically in the part where it is trying to add websocket routes from the `router` parameter to the current router.

The bug is occurring because the `include_router` method is trying to directly call the `add_api_route` method to add the websocket routes, which is not correct. The `add_api_route` method is intended for adding HTTP routes, not websocket routes.

To fix the bug, a new method `add_websocket_route` should be added to the `APIRouter` class to handle the addition of websocket routes. This method needs to be implemented to correctly handle websocket routes and call the appropriate FastAPI methods to add them to the router.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def add_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, route: types.Callable, *, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        """
        Adds a websocket route to the APIRouter.
        :param path: The path of the websocket route.
        :param route: The function to be called for the route.
        :param name: The name of the route.
        """
        if not path.startswith("/"):
            raise ValueError("A path for a websocket route must start with '/'")
        if not callable(route):
            raise ValueError("The route must be a callable function")
        route_name = name or route.__name__
        self.routes.append(
            routing.WebsocketRoute(route=route, path=path, name=route_name)
        )

    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
