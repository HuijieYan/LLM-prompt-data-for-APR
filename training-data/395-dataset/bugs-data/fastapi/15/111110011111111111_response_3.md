The bug is likely in the `include_router` function, specifically in the loop where it iterates over `router.routes`. This is evidenced by the discrepancy between the runtime value and the expected value for the `route.path` and `route.name` variables.

The bug occurred because the `include_router` function doesn't correctly set up the WebSocket routes for the included router. There seems to be a discrepancy between the WebSocket routes created on the `APIRouter` and the routes created on the main `FastAPI` object.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that WebSocket routes from the included router are properly added to the main `APIRouter`. This can be achieved by looping through the router's routes and checking for WebSocket routes. If a WebSocket route is found, it should be added using the `add_websocket_route` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name
            )
```

This updated code includes a check for WebSocket routes and handles them appropriately using the `add_websocket_route` method. This should fix the bug and allow WebSocket routes to work properly on both `FastAPI` and `APIRouter` objects.
