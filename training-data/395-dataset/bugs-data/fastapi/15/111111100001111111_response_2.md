The bug in the `include_router` function is that it is trying to call the `add_api_route` method with parameters that it does not accept. The `add_api_route` method only accepts two parameters, `path` and `endpoint`, but `include_router` is trying to pass additional parameters that are not accepted, such as `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, etc.

The reason this bug occurs is that the `include_router` function is trying to add routes from one router to another, but it is not correctly handling WebSocket routes. The `add_api_route` method is only designed to handle standard HTTP routes, not WebSocket routes.

To fix this bug, the `include_router` function needs to be updated to correctly handle WebSocket routes by adding them to the APIRouter in a different way than standard HTTP routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if route.websocket:
                self.routes.append(
                    WebSocketRoute(
                        path=prefix + route.path,
                        endpoint=route.endpoint,
                        receive=route.receive,
                        send=route.send,
                        name=route.name
                    )
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

This corrected code checks if a route in the `router` is a WebSocketRoute, and if so, it adds it to the `APIRouter` using the `WebSocketRoute` class. For standard HTTP routes, it still calls the `add_api_route` or `add_route` method as before.
