The potential error in the code lies in the `include_router` function, particularly in the `if isinstance(route, APIRoute)` block. This is where the routes from the provided `APIRouter` are being added to the main `FastAPI` application.

The bug occurs because the `include_router` function does not handle websocket routes properly when they are included from an `APIRouter`. This causes the websocket routes to only work on the main `FastAPI` object, not on the `APIRouter` objects.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` function should be modified to properly handle websocket routes when they are included from an `APIRouter`.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected function, we added a condition to check if the route is a websocket route using `isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute)`. If it is, we use `self.websocket_route` to add the route to the application. Otherwise, we use `self.add_api_route` to add the regular API route. This modification allows the `include_router` function to handle websocket routes properly when included from an `APIRouter`.
