The issue arises from the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The method loops through the routes in the provided router and adds them to the current router. The issue seems to be related to the handling of WebSocket routes when they are included using the `include_router` method.

The bug occurs because when a WebSocket route is added to the `APIRouter` using the `include_router` method, it does not register correctly and ends up throwing a 403 error.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `include_router` method to explicitly handle WebSocket routes. FastAPI provides a method called `add_websocket_route` specifically for WebSocket routes. When including a router, we should check if the route is a WebSocket route and add it using the `add_websocket_route` method. This will ensure that WebSocket routes are correctly registered when included through the `include_router` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi import APIRouter

def include_router(
    self, router: APIRouter, *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        else:
            if hasattr(route, "websocket"):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name
                )
            else:
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

This modification checks if the route has the `websocket` attribute and adds it as a WebSocket route using the `add_websocket_route` method. If it doesn't have the `websocket` attribute, it adds it as a normal route using the `add_route` method. This ensures that WebSocket routes are registered correctly when included using the `include_router` method.
