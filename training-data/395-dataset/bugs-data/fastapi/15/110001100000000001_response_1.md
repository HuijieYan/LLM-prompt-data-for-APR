Potential Error:
The function `include_router` is trying to call `add_api_route` which doesn't exist within the current scope. It should be calling `add_api_route` using `self` instead of `self.add_api_route`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the function is trying to call a method that doesn't exist within the current scope.

Possible Approaches:
Replace `self.add_api_route` with `self.add_api_route` to call the correct method.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_15/fastapi/routing.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),

        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
