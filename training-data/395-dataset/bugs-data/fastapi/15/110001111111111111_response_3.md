The error is occurring in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class.
The issue is happening because the `include_router` method is trying to add routes from the provided router to itself using the `add_api_route` method, which doesn't exist. Instead, it should be using the `add_websocket_route` method for WebSocket routes.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` method should be updated to iterate through the routes of the provided router and add WebSocket routes using the `add_websocket_route` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith("/"), (
            "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        )
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

This updated code ensures that WebSocket routes from the provided router are added to the current router using the `add_websocket_route` method, resolving the issue with WebSocket routes not working on APIRouter objects.
