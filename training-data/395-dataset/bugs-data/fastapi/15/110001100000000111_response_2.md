Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the `include_router` method in the `routing.py` file.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `include_router` method does not properly handle websocket routes when the route is added to the APIRouter object. The `include_router` method is not correctly calling the `add_api_route` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `add_api_route` method needs to be updated to handle websocket routes appropriately when added to the APIRouter object. The `include_router` method should be modified to correctly call the `add_api_route` method and handle websocket routes.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_15/fastapi/routing.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, **kwargs) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

    # this is the corrected function

        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
