The potential error in the given code is that the `add_api_route` method is being called with more arguments than it accepts. The `include_router` method is trying to pass additional arguments such as `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, `description`, etc. to `add_api_route`, which does not support these arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `include_router` method to only pass the arguments that the `add_api_route` method supports.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute, Route

class YourClassNameHere:
    def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def include_router(
            self, router: APIRouter, *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint
                )
            elif isinstance(route, Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

In the corrected code, the `include_router` method now only passes the `path` and `endpoint` arguments to the `add_api_route` method, as it accepts. The additional arguments such as `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, `description` etc. have been removed.
