The error messages indicate that there is an issue with the WebSocket connections in the test functions. This suggests that the `include_router` function is not correctly adding the routes to the APIRouter.

Upon review, it seems that the bug is caused by the incomplete implementation of the `include_router` function, which is missing the necessary logic to process the WebSocket routes and add them to the APIRouter.

To fix this issue, the `include_router` function needs to be updated to properly handle WebSocket routes. Additionally, the function should consider the prefix when adding routes.

Here's the corrected `include_router` function:

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from starlette.routing import WebSocketRoute
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter


def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        else:
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In this corrected code:
- The `WebSocketRoute` objects are handled separately using the `add_websocket_route` method.
- The `APIRoute` objects are handled with the existing `add_api_route` logic.
- Other route types are handled with a generic `add_route` method.

By making these changes, the `include_router` function should now correctly add the WebSocket and other routes to the APIRouter. This should resolve the issues encountered in the test functions.
