The bug is located in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The method is supposed to add routes from another router to the current router, but it does not handle WebSocket routes properly.

The reason behind the bug is that the `include_router` method does not handle WebSocket routes from the included router correctly. When a WebSocket route is included, it should call the `add_websocket_route` method instead of the `add_api_route` method, as WebSocket routes have different handling requirements.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `include_router` method to differentiate between regular HTTP routes and WebSocket routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
# Corrected include_router method
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In this corrected code, when the `include_router` method encounters a WebSocketRoute, it calls the `add_websocket_route` method instead of the `add_api_route` method. This ensures that WebSocket routes are properly added to the router.
