The error is occurring in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The issue is that the `add_api_route` method is being called with more arguments than it expects, which is causing the 403 error.

To fix this issue, the corrected code for the `include_router` method is as follows:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
```

By removing the additional arguments in the `add_api_route` and `add_route` methods, this should fix the bug and allow the websocket route to work on both a FastAPI and APIRouter object.
