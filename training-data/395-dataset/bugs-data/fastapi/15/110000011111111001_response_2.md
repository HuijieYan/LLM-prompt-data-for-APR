# The potential error location within the problematic function is the `include_router` method.

# Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of the prefix parameter in the `include_router` method. The code appends the route's path to the prefix without considering the trailing slash. This may result in incorrect URL formation, causing the tests to fail.
- Additionally, the prefix handling might not be consistent with leading and trailing slashes, leading to incorrect route formation.

# Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Ensure that the prefix handling is consistent, taking into account leading and trailing slashes appropriately.
- Verify the correct formation of the URL by the addition of the route's path to the prefix.

# Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
