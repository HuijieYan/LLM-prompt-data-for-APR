Potential Error Location:
The error may be occurring in the line `self.add_api_route` where the `prefix` variable is being concatenated with `route.path`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation does not properly handle the case when `prefix` is an empty string. When `prefix` is empty, the concatenation of `prefix + route.path` does not add a leading slash to the route path, leading to incorrect routes.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `prefix` is empty, we do not add an extra slash, but when `prefix` is not empty, we add a trailing slash. Additionally, we can add a check to ensure all routes start with a leading slash.

Corrected Code:
```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_path = route.path
            if not prefix and not route_path.startswith("/"):
                route_path = "/" + route_path
            elif prefix and not route_path.startswith("/"):
                route_path = prefix + "/" + route_path
            elif prefix and route_path.startswith("/"):
