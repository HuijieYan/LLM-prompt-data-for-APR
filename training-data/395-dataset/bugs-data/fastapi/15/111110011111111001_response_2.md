The buggy function `include_router` from class `APIRouter` is supposed to iterate over the routes of the provided `router` instance and modify their paths by prefixing them with the provided `prefix`. The function then adds these modified routes to the instance of `APIRouter` that called `include_router`.

Looking at the error messages from the test functions, it seems that when the routes from the provided `router` are being added to the calling `APIRouter` instance, the websocket connections are being closed with a 1000 status code, which means the closures are intentional.

Upon further investigation, it seems that the bug is due to the incomplete implementation of the `include_router` method. The method only handles instances of `APIRoute` and `routing.Route`, but does not handle instances of `WebSocketRoute`, resulting in the unexpected closure of websocket connections.

To fix this, the `include_router` method should also handle instances of `WebSocketRoute` and process them accordingly for websocket connections.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):  # Handle WebSocketRoutes
            self.add_websocket_route(  # Add a method to handle WebSocketRoutes
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
