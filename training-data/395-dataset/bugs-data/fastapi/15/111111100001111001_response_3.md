The bug in the given code is caused by the "include_router" function. The issue appears to be with the use of "response_model" and "status_code" parameters in the "self.add_api_route" method call inside the "include_router" function.

The "response_model" and "status_code" parameters are not being used in the "add_api_route" method definition in the "APIRouter" class. Therefore, passing these parameters is causing an error.

To fix this bug, the "include_router" function should be modified to remove the "response_model" and "status_code" parameters from the "self.add_api_route" method call.

Here's the corrected code for the "include_router" function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

This corrected code removes the "response_model" and "status_code" parameters from the "self.add_api_route" method call. Now the function should work as expected without any errors.
