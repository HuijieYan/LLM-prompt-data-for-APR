The error seems to be related to the websocket routes not working properly when defined within an `APIRouter` object. 

Looking at the code, it seems that the issue lies within the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The method is attempting to add websocket routes, but it does not support websocket routes. This is causing the websocket connections to fail when using the `APIRouter` object.

To fix this issue, the `include_router` method should be updated to only handle HTTP routes. Websocket routes should be defined directly in the main FastAPI application, not within an `APIRouter` object.

Here's the corrected `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

By removing the attempt to add websocket routes within the `include_router` method, the issue will be resolved. Websocket routes should be defined directly within the main FastAPI application instead.

The bug is fixed by removing the attempt to handle websocket routes in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. Websocket routes should be defined directly within the main FastAPI application, and not within an `APIRouter` object.
