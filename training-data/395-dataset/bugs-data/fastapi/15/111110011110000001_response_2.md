The error seems to be occurring in the WebSocket connection in the test functions. However, the issue is likely related to the `include_router` method in the `APIRouter` class, especially in handling the `prefix` parameter.

The bug in the `include_router` method is that it is trying to add a WebSocket route using the `add_api_route` method, which is designed for HTTP routes, not WebSocket routes. This is likely causing the WebSocket connection issues in the test functions.

To fix this bug, a new method for adding WebSocket routes should be implemented, which can then be called within the `include_router` method when it encounters WebSocket routes.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, WebSocketRoute
from typing import Callable

class APIRouter(APIRouter):
    def add_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = WebSocketRoute(path, endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)

    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):  # Adding the condition to handle WebSocket routes
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

The `add_websocket_route` method is added to the `APIRouter` class to specifically handle WebSocket routes. This method is then called within the `include_router` method to correctly add WebSocket routes to the router.
