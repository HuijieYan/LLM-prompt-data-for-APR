The error message in both test functions is related to the WebSocket connection not working properly due to the incorrect routing configuration. 

The potential error in the problematic function is the `include_router` method. It seems that the `prefix` parameter is not being handled correctly in all cases, which is causing issues when connecting to the WebSocket.

The bug occurs because the `prefix` parameter is not being properly formatted when creating the API routes for the WebSocket connections. As a result, the WebSocket connections are failing due to incorrect routing.

To fix this bug, the `prefix` parameter should be properly handled for all routes, ensuring that it is formatted correctly before being added to the path.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from typing import List

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "/", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix != "/":
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
          self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

By setting a default value of "/" for the `prefix` parameter and handling it properly for all routes, the bug should be fixed and the WebSocket connections should work as expected.
