The error occurs when trying to create a WebSocket connection using the client. The issue seems to be with how the WebSocket routes are being handled when copied from a FastAPI object to an APIRouter object.

The problematic function is `include_router` in the `fastapi.routing` module. The bug seems to be related to how WebSocket routes are being handled in the `include_router` function. The `include_router` function is trying to add a WebSocket route to the APIRouter, but it is not handling it properly, resulting in a 403 error when trying to create a WebSocket connection.

To fix this issue, the `include_router` function should be modified to properly handle WebSocket routes when added to the APIRouter.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute
from typing import List, Callable

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        else:
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=None,
                status_code=200,
                tags=tags,
            )
```

This corrected code modifies the `include_router` function to handle WebSocket routes properly when added to the APIRouter, ensuring that WebSocket routes work on both the main FastAPI object and APIRouter objects.
