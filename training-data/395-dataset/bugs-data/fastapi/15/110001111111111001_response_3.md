The error occurs at the line `prepend="/"` inside the `client.websocket_connect` call. This suggests that the `prefix` is not properly set when calling the `include_router` function.

The bug in the `include_router` function is likely caused by the addition of the `prefix` to the `WebSocketRoute` objects' `path` attribute. The bug is that the prefix is added to the route path without considering if the prefix already contains a trailing slash.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to check if the `prefix` ends with a slash, and adapt the route paths accordingly.

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_path = prefix + route.path
            # Check if prefix ends with '/'
            if prefix.endswith("/"):
                # If prefix ends with a slash and route path starts with a slash, we remove the duplicate slash
                if route_path.startswith("/"):
                    route_path = prefix[:-1] + route.path
            else:
                # If prefix does not end with a slash and the route path does not start with a slash, we add a slash between them
                if not route_path.startswith("/"):
                    route_path = prefix + "/" + route.path
            self.add_api_route(
                route_path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            # Handle non-APIRoute case similarly
            # ...
```

In the corrected code, the `route_path` is generated by concatenating the `prefix` and the `route.path`. Then, based on whether the `prefix` ends with a slash and whether the `route.path` starts with a slash, the correct path is formed. If the `prefix` ends with a slash and the `route.path` starts with a slash, we remove the duplicate slash. If the `prefix` does not end with a slash and the `route.path` does not start with a slash, we add a slash between them.
