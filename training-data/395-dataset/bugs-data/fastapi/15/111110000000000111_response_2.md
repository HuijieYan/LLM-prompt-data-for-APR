The error is likely occurring in the `add_api_route` method inside the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The `add_api_route` method is trying to add a websocket route to the router, but it is not correctly handling websocket routes, which is causing the 403 error.

The bug occurs because the `add_api_route` method does not handle websocket routes properly. Websocket routes require special handling and cannot be handled in the same way as regular HTTP routes.

To fix the bug, you need to create a new method `add_websocket_route` in the `APIRouter` class specifically for adding websocket routes. This method should handle websocket routes differently from regular HTTP routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `APIRouter` class:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of the corrected function
    def add_websocket_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable) -> None:
        # add websocket route logic here
        pass

    # corrected include_router function
    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                if route.websocket:
                    self.add_websocket_route(
                        prefix + route.path, route.endpoint
                    )
                else:
                    self.add_route(
                        prefix + route.path,
                        route.endpoint,
                        methods=route.methods,
                        include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                        name=route.name,
                    )
```

In the corrected code, a new method `add_websocket_route` has been added to handle websocket routes separately from regular HTTP routes. This method should contain the logic to correctly handle websocket routes. Additionally, in the `include_router` method, we now check if the route is a websocket route and call the `add_websocket_route` method accordingly.
