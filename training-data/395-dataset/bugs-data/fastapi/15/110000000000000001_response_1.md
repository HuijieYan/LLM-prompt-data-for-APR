The potential error in this function is that the condition `if isinstance(route, APIRoute):` is used without importing the `APIRoute` class or defining it within the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `APIRoute` class is not being recognized due to missing import or definition.

To fix this bug, the `APIRoute` class must be imported or defined within the function. Assuming that `APIRoute` is a class from the `fastapi` package, it should be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code with the necessary import added:

```python
from fastapi import APIRoute  # assuming APIRoute is from the fastapi package

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):  # Assuming routing is already imported
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
