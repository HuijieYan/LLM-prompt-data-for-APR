The error is occurring in the 'WebSocketDisconnect' message, which indicates that there is an issue with the WebSocket connection. The 'client.websocket_connect' method is being called with a path parameter, and the error occurs at this point. The issue is likely related to the 'include_router' function not correctly handling the 'path' parameter when setting up the 'APIRoute'.

The potential error location within the 'include_router' function is the usage of 'self.add_api_route' when iterating over the routes of the router.

The bug is occurring because the 'include_router' function is not correctly handling the 'prefix' parameter. This causes the WebSocket client to be unable to connect to the specified path due to the incorrect routing setup.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the 'prefix' parameter is properly utilized when adding routes from the 'router' to the current 'APIRouter'. This requires concatenating the 'prefix' to the route path when setting up the routes.

Here is the corrected code for the 'include_router' function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

This corrected code now concatenates the 'prefix' to the route paths, ensuring that the WebSocket connection will have the correct path for connecting to the router.
