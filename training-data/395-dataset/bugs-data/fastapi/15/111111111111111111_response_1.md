The error occurs when trying to make a WebSocket connection to a route defined within the APIRouter. This error is because the APIRouter's `include_router` method does not properly handle WebSocket routes, resulting in a 403 Forbidden error.

To fix this issue, the APIRouter's `include_router` method needs to properly handle WebSocket routes by adding them to the router's routes.

One approach to fix the bug is to modify the `include_router` method to check for WebSocket routes and properly add them to the router's routes using the `add_api_route` method.

Additionally, the use of the `add_api_route` method within the `include_router` method might need to be revised to align with the correct method signature and parameters.

The corrected function for the `include_router` method is as follows:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

By updating the `include_router` method to properly handle WebSocket routes and adding them to the router's routes, this should address the 403 Forbidden error when trying to make WebSocket connections to routes within the APIRouter.
