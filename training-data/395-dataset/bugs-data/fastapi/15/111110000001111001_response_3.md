The error in the given function occurs because the `add_api_route` method is being called with more arguments than it is defined to accept. The `add_api_route` method is defined to accept only two arguments: `path` and `endpoint`, but in the `include_router` method, it is being called with additional arguments such as `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, etc.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `include_router` method to correctly handle the arguments and call the `add_api_route` method accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

This code removes the additional arguments from the `add_api_route` method and ensures that it only receives `path` and `endpoint` which are defined in its signature.
