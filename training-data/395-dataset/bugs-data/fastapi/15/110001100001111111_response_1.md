The bug occurs in the `include_router` method. The issue is being caused because the `include_router` method is trying to call `add_api_route` but is providing arguments that `add_api_route` does not accept. This is because `add_api_route` only accepts `path` and `endpoint` as arguments, but `include_router` is providing additional arguments such as `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, and others.

To fix this bug, a new method needs to be created, for example, `add_websocket_route`, specifically for handling websocket routes in the `APIRouter` class. This new method should accept the additional arguments that are being provided in the `include_router` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable) -> None:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def add_websocket_route(
    self,
    path: str,
    endpoint: Callable,
    response_model: Any,
    status_code: int,
    tags: List[str],
    summary: str,
    description: str,
    response_description: str,
    deprecated: bool,
    methods: List[str],
    operation_id: str,
    include_in_schema: bool,
    content_type: Any,
    name: str,
) -> None:
    # ... implementation of websocket route ...
    pass

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
With this correction, the `include_router` method will now correctly handle websocket routes using the `add_websocket_route` method, and the bug should be fixed.
