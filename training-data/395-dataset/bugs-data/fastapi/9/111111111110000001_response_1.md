1. The test case is checking the OpenAPI schema for the "/products" and "/shops" endpoints to see if the request bodies are as expected. The error message indicates that the content type for the request body is different from what is expected for the "/products" endpoint.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to how the request body schema is being constructed, especially in the context of different content types.

3. The bug seems to be caused by a mismatch in the content type of the request body schema. The error message indicates that the content type "application/json" is expected, but the actual content type is "application/vnd.api+json" for the request body.

4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to ensure that the correct content type is used for the request body schema. Additionally, the function should be enhanced to handle different content types appropriately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi.params import Body, Form, File

def get_body_field(*, dependant: Dependant, name: str) -> Optional[Field]:
    flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(dependant)
    if not flat_dependant.body_params:
        return None
    model_name = "Body_" + name
    BodyModel = create_model(model_name)
    for f in flat_dependant.body_params:
        field_content = get_schema_compatible_field(f)
        BodyModel.__annotations__[f.name] = field_content
    required = any(True for f in flat_dependant.body_params if f.required)
    content_type = determine_content_type(flat_dependant.body_params)
    field = Body(..., model=BodyModel, media_type=content_type)
    return field

def determine_content_type(body_params: List[Parameter]):
    if any(isinstance(f.schema, File) for f in body_params):
        return "multipart/form-data"
    elif any(isinstance(f.schema, Form) for f in body_params):
        return "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    else:
        return "application/json"
```

In the corrected code:
- The function `get_schema_compatible_field` is extracted outside and used to get the field's content.
- A new function `determine_content_type` is added to determine the content type based on the body parameters.
- The `Body` function is used to create the request body field, with the appropriate content type and model.
