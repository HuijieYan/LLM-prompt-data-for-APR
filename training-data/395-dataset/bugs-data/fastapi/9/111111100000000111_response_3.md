The error seems to be related to the incorrect media type being used for the requestBody in the openapi.json file. This is likely happening because the `get_body_field` function is not setting the correct media type for the requestBody in the FastAPI path operation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when setting the `BodySchema` for the requestBody. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the media type of the requestBody, leading to the incorrect default media type being set in the openapi.json.

The bug occurred because the `get_body_field` function does not have proper logic to set the media type for the requestBody based on the `Dependant` and `Field` parameters provided.

To fix the bug, the `get_body_field` function should be modified to properly handle the media type of the requestBody based on the parameters provided and set the correct media type in the `openapi.json`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_body_field(*, dependant: Dependant, name: str) -> Optional[Field]:
    flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(dependant)
    if not flat_dependant.body_params:
        return None
    
    BodyModel = create_model("Body_" + name, __base__=BaseModel)

    for f in flat_dependant.body_params:
        BodyModel.__annotations__[f.name] = get_schema_compatible_field(field=f)

    required_fields = [f.name for f in flat_dependant.body_params if f.required]
    
    field = Field(
        name="body",
        type_=BodyModel,
        default=None,
        required=bool(required_fields),
        alias="body",
    )
    return field
```

This corrected code properly creates the `BodyModel` using `create_model` and sets the annotations for the model fields based on the `Dependant` parameters provided. It also sets the required status based on the presence of required fields in the requestBody.

This should correctly set the media type for the requestBody in the openapi.json based on the parameters provided in the FastAPI path operation.
