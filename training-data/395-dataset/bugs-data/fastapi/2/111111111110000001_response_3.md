Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the test case where the websocket is expected to receive "Override" but instead receives "Socket Dependency".

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to the fact that the websocket receive_text() method is not receiving the expected dependency override value of "Override". This indicates that the websocket endpoint is not properly accessing the overridden dependency.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the overridden dependency is properly defined and accessible to the websocket endpoint.
2. Check if the endpoint function is properly configured to use the overridden dependency.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_2/fastapi/routing.py

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=[Depends(ws_dependency)])
        self.routes.append(route)
```
