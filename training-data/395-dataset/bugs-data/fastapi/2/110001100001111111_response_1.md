The issue is related to the `add_api_websocket_route` function not properly adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute`. This causes the overrides to not be taken into account when using websockets.

The potential error location is in the `add_api_websocket_route` function where the `dependency_overrides_provider` is not being passed to `APIWebSocketRoute`.

The reason for the bug is that the `add_api_websocket_route` function does not include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating the `APIWebSocketRoute`. This results in the overrides not being applied to the websockets.

To fix this bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to be modified to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating the `APIWebSocketRoute`.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider=None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In this corrected code:
- The `dependency_overrides_provider` parameter is added to the function signature with a default value of `None`.
- When creating the `APIWebSocketRoute`, the `dependency_overrides_provider` parameter is included in the constructor.

This change ensures that the `dependency_overrides_provider` is properly passed to the `APIWebSocketRoute` and the overrides are applied to the websockets as expected.
