The error message in the test function indicates that the websocket is receiving "Socket Dependency" instead of "Override". This suggests that the dependency_override is not being applied correctly in the websocket connection.

The issue is likely with the `add_api_websocket_route` method, specifically with the `name` parameter not being utilized to handle dependency overrides.

Upon method analysis, it appears that there isn't a check to apply dependency overrides when adding websocket routes. This could potentially cause the websocket to use the default dependency instead of the overridden one, leading to the error observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, a check should be added to apply dependency overrides if they are provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` method:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    if name in self.dependency_overrides_provider:
        endpoint = self.dependency_overrides_provider[name](endpoint)
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding a check for `name` in `self.dependency_overrides_provider`, we can apply the dependency overrides if they are provided. This should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
