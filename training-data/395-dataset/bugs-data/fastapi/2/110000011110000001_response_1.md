The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with the `websocket.receive_text()` method, where it is expecting "Override" but receiving "Socket Dependency" instead.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the `add_api_websocket_route` is not properly creating the route for the WebSocket connection, resulting in the incorrect behavior when the test case is executed.

The bug occurs because the `add_api_websocket_route` function is not creating the WebSocket route correctly, which leads to erroneous behavior when the test case is executed.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `add_api_websocket_route` function creates the WebSocket route properly by providing the correct path, endpoint, and name if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from fastapi.websockets import WebSocket

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIRouter()
    route.add_websocket_route(path, endpoint, name=name)
    self.include_router(route)
```

This corrected function now properly creates a WebSocket route using `APIRouter` and the `add_websocket_route` method. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
