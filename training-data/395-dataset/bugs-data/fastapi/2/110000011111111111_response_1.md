The error occurs because the APIWebSocketRoute class does not have support for dependency overrides.

To fix this bug, you need to modify the APIWebSocketRoute class to support dependency overrides. This can be achieved by passing the dependency overrides to the APIWebSocketRoute when instantiating it inside the add_api_websocket_route function.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute
from typing import Callable

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By passing the dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute class when instantiating it, the dependency overrides will be taken into account for websockets, and the test case should work as expected.
