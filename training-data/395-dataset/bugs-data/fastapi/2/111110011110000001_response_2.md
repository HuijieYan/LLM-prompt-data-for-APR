The error occurs in the `test_router_ws_depends_with_override` test function. The test is trying to override a dependency called `ws_dependency` with a lambda function that returns the string "Override". Then, it attempts to establish a websocket connection and expects to receive the text "Override". However, the received text is "Socket Dependency", which indicates that the dependency override did not work as expected.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies in the `add_api_websocket_route` function in the `APIRouter` class. The function is intended to add a websocket route to the router, but it is not handling dependencies properly, which leads to the incorrect behavior in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to be modified to handle dependency overrides. One possible approach is to use the `dependencies` parameter in the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor to specify the dependency to be used for the websocket route. This will allow the route to properly utilize the overridden dependency.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies: List[Depends] = []
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=dependencies)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding the `dependencies` parameter to the `add_api_websocket_route` function and passing it to the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor, the function now properly handles dependencies, allowing for correct dependency overrides as demonstrated in the test case.
