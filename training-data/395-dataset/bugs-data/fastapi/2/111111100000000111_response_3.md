Potential error location: The issue lies in the add_api_websocket_route function where the dependency_overrides_provider is not being added to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the add_api_websocket_route function does not handle the dependency overrides for websockets, leading to the original dependencies being used instead of the overridden ones.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The fix involves modifying the add_api_websocket_route function to include the dependency overrides for the APIWebSocketRoute.

Corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides: Dict[Type[Any], Any] = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides=dependency_overrides)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
