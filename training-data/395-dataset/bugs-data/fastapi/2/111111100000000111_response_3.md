Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the function add_api_websocket_route as it doesn't handle dependency overrides for websockets, causing the original dependencies to be used instead of the overridden ones.

Explanation:
The add_api_websocket_route function is responsible for adding a new APIWebSocketRoute to the routes list, but it doesn't handle dependency overrides which are necessary for websockets. This results in the original dependencies being used instead of the overridden ones, leading to the bug.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the add_api_websocket_route function to handle dependency overrides for websockets.
2. Ensure that the APIWebSocketRoute takes dependency overrides into account when creating a new route.

Corrected Function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_2/fastapi/routing.py

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
