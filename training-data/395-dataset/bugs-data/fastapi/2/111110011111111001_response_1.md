The error message suggests that the `websocket.receive_text()` method is returning the text "Socket Dependency" instead of "Override", which is the expected value.

The issue might be with the dependency overrides not being applied correctly in the `add_api_websocket_route` function. It seems that the `dependency_overrides` are not being passed to the routes created within the function.

The `add_api_websocket_route` function should be updated to pass along the `dependency_overrides` to the routes it creates.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(
            path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider
        )
        self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, an instance of `APIWebSocketRoute` is created with an additional parameter `dependency_overrides_provider`, which is set to `self.dependency_overrides_provider` passed from the parent router. This ensures that the dependency overrides are also applied to the websocket routes added via the `add_api_websocket_route` function.
