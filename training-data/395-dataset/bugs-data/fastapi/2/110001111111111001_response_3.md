The provided buggy function is `add_api_websocket_route` which is a method of a class. The function appends a new `APIWebSocketRoute` to the `routes` attribute of the class. There are multiple issues identified in the provided function and its associated runtime values, types and expected values.

1. In the provided test case, an assertion error occurs while trying to compare the string received from the websocket with the expected value. The expected value is "Override", but the received value is "Socket Dependency". This indicates that the websocket message is not being overridden with the expected value.

2. The function `add_api_websocket_route` does not include any logical functionality to interact with dependencies, which could be the cause of the issue.

3. Upon analyzing the code and its runtime values, it seems like the `dependency_overrides` are not being applied when creating the websocket routes.

To fix the function, we need to ensure that the dependencies are properly overridden when creating the websocket routes. Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_2/fastapi/routing.py

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides: Dict = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides=dependency_overrides)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In this corrected function, an additional parameter `dependency_overrides` of type `Dict` is added. This parameter allows the caller to provide dependency overrides when creating the websocket routes. By passing the `dependency_overrides` to the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor, the dependencies can be properly overridden for the websocket routes.

With this correction, the test case `test_router_ws_depends_with_override` should no longer encounter the assertion error, and the websocket message should be properly overridden with the expected value.
