The function needs to be corrected by importing the `APIWebSocketRoute` class and `Callable` type. The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
