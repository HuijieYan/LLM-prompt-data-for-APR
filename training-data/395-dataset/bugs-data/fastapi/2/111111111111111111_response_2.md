The issue seems to be related to the `add_api_websocket_route` function not properly considering the dependency overrides when adding a new WebSocket route.

Given the error message from the test function, it is clear that the dependency override for the WebSocket route is not being applied correctly. The expected behavior is that the override should replace the original dependency, but the test is using the original dependency instead.

The potential error location within the `add_api_websocket_route` function is the way it handles the dependency overrides when adding a new WebSocket route.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to be modified to incorporate the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating a new WebSocket route. This ensures that any dependency overrides are considered and applied correctly when adding the route.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function for add_api_websocket_route
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By including the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating a new `APIWebSocketRoute` in the `add_api_websocket_route` function, any dependency overrides will be properly applied to the WebSocket route.

With this fix, the dependency override for the WebSocket route should work as expected, and the test case should pass without the assertion error.
