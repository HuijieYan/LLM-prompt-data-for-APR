Potential error location: 

The potential error is with the `self.routes.append(route)` line, as it may not be initializing the `routes` list properly before attempting to append to it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The `routes` list may not be defined or initialized within the `APIRouter` class, causing an AttributeError when trying to append to it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

Initialize the `routes` list within the `APIRouter` class before attempting to append to it.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.routes = []

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
