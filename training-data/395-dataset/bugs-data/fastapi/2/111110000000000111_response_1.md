Potential error:
The bug is occurring in the add_api_websocket_route function, where it is not adding the dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Reasons behind the bug:
The add_api_websocket_route function is missing the logic to add the dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute, causing the overrides to not be taken into account when testing with websockets.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to include the logic for adding the dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function to add api websocket route with dependency overrides
    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider=None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
