The buggy function `add_api_websocket_route` is intended to add an `APIWebSocketRoute` to the `routes` list of the `APIRouter` object. The function seems to be working as expected, but the wrong type of object `APIWebSocketRoute` is being appended to the `routes` list.

The issue lies in the instantiation of the `APIWebSocketRoute` object. It seems that the class `APIWebSocketRoute` is not being properly imported or defined, resulting in the wrong type of object being created. 

To fix this issue, make sure that the `APIWebSocketRoute` class is properly imported or defined with the correct attributes and methods. Additionally, ensure that the correct type of object is being created and appended to the `routes` list. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
