Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)` where `APIWebSocketRoute` is not defined. 

Reasons behind the bug: The code is trying to create an instance of `APIWebSocketRoute` but the class or function is not defined or imported in the given source code.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: You need to define or import the `APIWebSocketRoute` class in order to use it in the `add_api_websocket_route` function.

```python
# Corrected function
from route_module import APIWebSocketRoute  # import APIWebSocketRoute from the appropriate module

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
