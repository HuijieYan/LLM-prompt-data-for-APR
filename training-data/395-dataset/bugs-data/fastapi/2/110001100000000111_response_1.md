The issue seems to be related to dependency overrides not working for websockets in FastAPI. The add_api_websocket_route function does not add dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute, which causes the overrides to not be taken into account.

The potential error location within the function is in the line where the APIWebSocketRoute is created and added to the routes list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to add the dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider: Any = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, we added the `dependency_overrides_provider` parameter to the function signature and passed it to the APIWebSocketRoute constructor when creating the route. This change will ensure that the dependency overrides are taken into account for websockets when using FastAPI.
