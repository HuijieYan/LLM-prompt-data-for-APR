The bug in the provided function is that it appends the new route to the `self.routes` list without checking the route type. This results in `APIWebSocketRoute` being appended to `self.routes` which already contains `WebSocketRoute` objects. This issue arises because the function does not differentiate between different types of routes.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check the type of route being added and then append it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        if isinstance(route, APIWebSocketRoute):
            self.routes.append(route)
        else:
            # Handle the case when the route is not an APIWebSocketRoute
            pass
```

In this corrected code, we added a check using `isinstance` to verify if the route is an instance of `APIWebSocketRoute`. If it is, then we append it to `self.routes`. Otherwise, we can add an else block to handle other types of routes as per the requirement.
