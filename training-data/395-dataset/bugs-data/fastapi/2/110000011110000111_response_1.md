Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the dependency override not being taken into account when using websockets in the test case.

Reasons for Bug:
The add_api_websocket_route function does not handle dependency overrides properly when creating APIWebSocketRoute instances, leading to the original dependency being used instead of the overridden one.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the add_api_websocket_route function to handle dependency overrides for APIWebSocketRoute instances.
2. Ensure that the dependency_overrides_provider is properly utilized in the creation of APIWebSocketRoute.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import Callable, Optional
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute, APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider: Optional[Callable] = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, the add_api_websocket_route function now includes an optional parameter dependency_overrides_provider, which allows for the specified dependency overrides to be used when creating APIWebSocketRoute instances. This modification ensures that dependency overrides are properly handled when working with websockets.
