1. The test case is attempting to override a dependency for a WebSocket connection and then assert that the overridden value is received. However, the assertion fails because the function `add_api_websocket_route` is not properly handling dependency overrides for WebSocket routes.

2. The potential error location is the `add_api_websocket_route` function, specifically in the construction of the `APIWebSocketRoute` object.

3. The bug occurs because the `add_api_websocket_route` function is not considering dependency overrides when creating the `APIWebSocketRoute` object. As a result, the test case is unable to properly override the WebSocket dependency.

4. To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to take into account dependency overrides when creating the `APIWebSocketRoute` object. This can be achieved by modifying the function to retrieve the dependency from the `app` and pass it to the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor, allowing dependency overrides to be applied.

5. Corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    dependency = self.app.get_dependency(ws_dependency)  # Retrieve dependency from app
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency=dependency)  # Pass dependency to APIWebSocketRoute constructor
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In this corrected code, we retrieve the dependency using `self.app.get_dependency` and then pass it as an argument to the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor. This modification ensures that dependency overrides will be properly handled when creating WebSocket routes.
