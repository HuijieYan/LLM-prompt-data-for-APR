The error in the provided function `add_api_websocket_route` is that it appends the `APIWebSocketRoute` object to the `self.routes` list without considering the name parameter. This means that the name is not being assigned to the `APIWebSocketRoute` object, which causes the wrong value to be received in the test.

The bug occurs because the `name` parameter is not being used within the function. The provided test case expects the name parameter to be set, but the function does not set it.

To fix this bug, the `name` parameter should be used to initialize the `APIWebSocketRoute` object. The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

With this fix, the `name` parameter will be used to initialize the `APIWebSocketRoute` object, and the correct value will be received in the test.
