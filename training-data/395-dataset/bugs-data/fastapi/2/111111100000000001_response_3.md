Potential error location: The error likely stems from the fact that the `APIRouter` class is inheriting from `routing.Router`, but there is no import statement for the `routing` module.

Reasons behind the bug: The `routing` module is likely needed for the `APIRouter` class to properly inherit from `routing.Router`, as well as for the `APIWebSocketRoute` class used within the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Add the necessary import statement for the `routing` module so that the `APIRouter` class can properly inherit from `routing.Router`.
- Check if the `APIWebSocketRoute` class used within the function also requires a proper import statement.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
In the corrected code, the `APIWebSocketRoute` class is imported from the `fastapi.routing` module, which is assumed to be the correct import location. If this import location is incorrect, it should be replaced with the actual correct import statement.
