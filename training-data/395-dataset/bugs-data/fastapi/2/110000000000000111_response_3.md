Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the add_api_websocket_route function, where a new APIWebSocketRoute is being created without taking into account the dependency_overrides_provider.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The add_api_websocket_route function does not include the dependency_overrides_provider when creating a new APIWebSocketRoute. As a result, the overrides are not being taken into account when testing websockets.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the add_api_websocket_route function to include the dependency_overrides_provider when creating a new APIWebSocketRoute.
2. Ensure that the dependency_overrides_provider is correctly passed to the APIWebSocketRoute when adding a new route.

Corrected Code:
```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider: Any = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
In the corrected code, the add_api_websocket_route function now includes the dependency_overrides_provider parameter and passes it to the APIWebSocketRoute when creating a new route. This ensures that the overrides are taken into account when testing websockets.
