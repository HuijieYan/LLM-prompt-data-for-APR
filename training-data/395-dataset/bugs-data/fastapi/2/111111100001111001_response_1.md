The buggy function `add_api_websocket_route` is adding an `APIWebSocketRoute` to the `routes` list, but the issue is that the type of `self.routes` is not always consistent. In some cases, it's a list of `Route` objects, while in other cases, it's a list of `WebSocketRoute` and `APIWebSocketRoute` objects.

To fix this issue, we can ensure that the `routes` list only contains objects of type `Route`, `WebSocketRoute`, and `APIWebSocketRoute` by checking the type of the object being added to the list. We can also create a new list if needed and replace the existing `routes` list with the new one.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        
        new_routes = []
        for r in self.routes:
            if isinstance(r, (routing.WebSocketRoute, routing.APIWebSocketRoute, routing.Route)):
                new_routes.append(r)
        
        new_routes.append(route)
        self.routes = new_routes
```
