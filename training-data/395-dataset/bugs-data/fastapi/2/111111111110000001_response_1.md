The error message seems to indicate that the "websocket.receive_text()" is returning "Socket Dependency" instead of the expected "Override". This suggests that the dependency override is not being applied correctly, which might be related to the problematic function "add_api_websocket_route".

The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the websocket endpoint dependency is being handled or overridden.

The bug is likely occurring because the "add_api_websocket_route" function is not properly associating the websocket endpoint with the overridden dependency.

To fix the bug, the "add_api_websocket_route" function should be updated to handle the dependency overrides properly.

Here's the corrected code for the "add_api_websocket_route" function:

```python
# Corrected function
    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies: list = None
    ) -> None:
        dependencies = dependencies or []
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=dependencies)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, the "add_api_websocket_route" function now accepts an additional parameter "dependencies" which allows the function to handle dependency overrides properly. This change ensures that the WebSocket endpoint is associated with the overridden dependency.
