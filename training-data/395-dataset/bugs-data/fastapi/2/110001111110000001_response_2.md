The error message in the test function indicates that the websocket receive_text() method is not returning "Override" as expected, but instead "Socket Dependency". This suggests that there is a problem with the websocket connection or the dependency being used.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the implementation of the websocket route. It's likely that the route is not properly handling the dependency overrides.

The bug occurs because the websocket route is not properly utilizing the dependency overrides that are being set in the test function. This causes the websocket connection to not use the overridden dependency, resulting in the assert statement failing.

To fix the bug, the add_api_websocket_route() function needs to be updated to properly handle dependency overrides. This may involve modifying how dependencies are passed to the websocket route or ensuring that the route is aware of any overridden dependencies.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route() function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies: list = []
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=dependencies)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding a "dependencies" parameter to the function and passing it to the APIWebSocketRoute constructor, the function now allows for dependencies to be provided and used by the websocket route. This will ensure that any overridden dependencies are properly utilized, fixing the bug.
