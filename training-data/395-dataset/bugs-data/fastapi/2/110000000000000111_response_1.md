The potential error in the provided function is that it is not applying the dependency overrides to the APIWebSocketRoute when adding a new route.

The bug occurs because the function add_api_websocket_route is not incorporating the dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute, resulting in the original dependency being used instead of the overridden one.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to ensure that the dependency overrides are correctly applied to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider: Callable = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding the parameter dependency_overrides_provider to the add_api_websocket_route function and passing it to the APIWebSocketRoute when creating a new route, we ensure that the dependency overrides are correctly applied to the websockets.
