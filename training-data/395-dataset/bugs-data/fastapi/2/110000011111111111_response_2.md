The error occurs because the original dependency is being used instead of the overridden dependency when testing the websocket connection. This is due to the original dependency not being properly passed to the APIWebSocketRoute.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to ensure that the dependency_overrides_provider is properly passed to the APIWebSocketRoute.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By including the `dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider` parameter in the APIWebSocketRoute creation, we ensure that the overridden dependencies are properly used within the websocket route.

With this correction, the test case `test_router_ws_depends_with_override` should now be able to use the overridden dependency and pass successfully.
