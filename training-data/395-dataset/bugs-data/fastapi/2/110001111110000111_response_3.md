1. The test case is testing the functionality of overriding dependencies for websockets in a FastAPI application. It seems that the dependency override is not being applied as expected, resulting in an assertion error.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `add_api_websocket_route` function, where the route is being added but the dependency overrides are not being considered.

3. The bug occurs because the `add_api_websocket_route` function does not take into account the dependency overrides when creating an instance of `APIWebSocketRoute`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add_api_websocket_route` function to consider dependency overrides when creating the `APIWebSocketRoute` instance. This can be achieved by retrieving the dependency overrides and passing them to the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor.

5. Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Callable, Optional, Dict
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides: Optional[Dict] = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides=dependency_overrides)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In this corrected function, we have added an additional parameter `dependency_overrides` and passed it to the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor. This allows the function to consider dependency overrides when creating the route.
