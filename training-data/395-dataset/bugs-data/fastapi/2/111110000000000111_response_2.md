The bug is related to the function add_api_websocket_route not adding dependency_override_provider to APIWebSocketRoute. This means that when using dependency overrides, the overrides are not taken into account when using websockets.

The potential error lies in the add_api_websocket_route function as it does not include the dependency_override_provider to APIWebSocketRoute.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to ensure that it also adds the dependency_override_provider to APIWebSocketRoute, so that dependency overrides are taken into account when using websockets.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None,
    dependency_overrides_provider: Callable = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
``` 

By adding the dependency_overrides_provider parameter to the add_api_websocket_route function and passing it to APIWebSocketRoute, this should fix the bug and ensure that dependency overrides are taken into account when using websockets.
