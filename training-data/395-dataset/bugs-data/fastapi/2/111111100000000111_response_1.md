Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the add_api_websocket_route function within the APIRouter class. It seems that the function is not properly adding the dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the add_api_websocket_route function is not including the dependency_overrides_provider when creating a new APIWebSocketRoute. This results in the overrides not being taken into account when using websockets.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the add_api_websocket_route function should be modified to include the dependency_overrides_provider when creating a new APIWebSocketRoute. This will ensure that the overrides are properly taken into account when using websockets.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(
            path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider
        )
        self.routes.append(route)
```
