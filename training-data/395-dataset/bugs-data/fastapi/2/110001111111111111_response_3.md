The error occurs because the add_api_websocket_route function does not take into account the dependency overrides when creating the APIWebSocketRoute. This results in the test using the original dependency instead of the overridden one.

To fix the bug, the add_api_websocket_route function needs to be updated to consider the dependency overrides when creating the APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, we include the dependency_overrides parameter when creating the APIWebSocketRoute, so that it takes into account any dependency overrides provided by the FastAPI application.
