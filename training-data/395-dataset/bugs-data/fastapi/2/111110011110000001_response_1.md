Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the WebSocket connection receiving the wrong text. This is likely related to the incorrect implementation of the `add_api_websocket_route` function in the `APIRouter` class.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the WebSocket route in the `add_api_websocket_route` function. This results in the WebSocket connection receiving the wrong text.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to ensure that the `add_api_websocket_route` function properly adds the WebSocket route to the `APIRouter` class and correctly handles the WebSocket connections.

```python
# Corrected function for the APIRouter class
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
        # Assuming there is a WebSocket route handler function, we need to register it properly
        self.websocket_route_handlers[path] = endpoint  # Add WebSocket route handler

# Test function remains the same
def test_router_ws_depends_with_override():
    client = TestClient(app)
    app.dependency_overrides[ws_dependency] = lambda: "Override"
    with client.websocket_connect("/router-ws-depends/") as websocket:
        assert websocket.receive_text() == "Override"
```

In the corrected code, we have added the `self.websocket_route_handlers[path] = endpoint` line to properly register the WebSocket route handler. This should ensure that the WebSocket connection receives the correct text.
