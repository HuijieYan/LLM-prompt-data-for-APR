The error message from the test function indicates that the websocket receive_text() method is returning 'Socket Dependency' instead of 'Override', which is expected. This suggests that the dependency override is not working as intended for websockets.

The potential error in the provided code is within the add_api_websocket_route method, where the dependency overrides are not being properly added to the APIWebSocketRoute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the add_api_websocket_route method does not incorporate the dependency override functionality, which causes the websocket connection to use the original dependency instead of the overridden one.

To fix the bug, the add_api_websocket_route method should be modified to properly include the dependency overrides for the APIWebSocketRoute creation.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route method:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):

    # ... (other code) ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides.get)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, the dependency_overrides_provider parameter is added to the APIWebSocketRoute creation, allowing the dependency overrides to be properly passed down to the websocket route.

This modification should address the bug related to the websocket dependency override not working as expected.
