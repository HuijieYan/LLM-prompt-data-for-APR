The issue with the `add_api_websocket_route` function seems to be that it is appending the new `APIWebSocketRoute` to the `self.routes` list, but it is not updating the `self.routes` attribute with the new list. 

The potential error location is the line:
```python
self.routes.append(route)
```

The bug occurs because the function appends the new route to the list but does not update the `self.routes` attribute with the new list containing the added route.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `self.routes` attribute with the new list containing the added route.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes = self.routes + [route]  # Update self.routes with the new list containing the added route
```

This change ensures that the `self.routes` attribute is updated with the new list containing the added route.
