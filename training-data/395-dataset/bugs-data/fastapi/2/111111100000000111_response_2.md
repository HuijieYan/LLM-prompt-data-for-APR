Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring within the add_api_websocket_route function, specifically in how it handles dependency overrides for websockets.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The add_api_websocket_route function is not adding dependency_overrides_provider to APIWebSocketRoute, which causes the dependency overrides not to be taken into account when using websockets.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The add_api_websocket_route function should be updated to ensure that it adds dependency_overrides_provider to APIWebSocketRoute, allowing the overrides to be considered when using websockets.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(
            path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider
        )
        self.routes.append(route)
```
