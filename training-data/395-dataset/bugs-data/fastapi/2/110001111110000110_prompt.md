# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Dependency override websocket broken
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Describe the bug
Dependency override does not work for websockets.

The function add_api_websocket_route does not add dependency_overrides_provider to APIWebSocketRoute.

To Reproduce
Create a simple app with websockets and test it with override.

Expected behavior
The overrides should be taken into account, but the test uses the original dependency.

Environment
OS: Windows
FastAPI version: 0.49.0
Python version: 3.6.8
```
