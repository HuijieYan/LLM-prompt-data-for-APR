The potential error in the provided function is that it does not take into account the dependency overrides when adding a route for websockets. This means that when a dependency override is specified, it is not being applied to the websocket routes.

To fix this bug, the add_api_websocket_route function needs to be updated to include the dependency overrides when adding a new APIWebSocketRoute. This can be achieved by passing the dependency overrides to the APIWebSocketRoute constructor.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import get_dependant

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider=None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

With this correction, the dependency_overrides_provider is now being explicitly passed when creating a new APIWebSocketRoute, ensuring that the dependency overrides are taken into account for websocket routes.
