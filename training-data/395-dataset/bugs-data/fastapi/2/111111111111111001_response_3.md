The provided error message indicates that the websocket is receiving the wrong text. This suggests that the websocket routing is not working correctly.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it appears that the `APIRouter` class has a method called `add_api_websocket_route` which is responsible for adding websocket routes to the router. The bug seems to be related to this method not correctly adding the websocket routes to the router.

The reason for the bug could be related to the implementation of the `add_api_websocket_route` method. It might not be appending the `route` correctly to `self.routes`.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `route` object is added correctly to the `self.routes` list within the `add_api_websocket_route` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` method:

```python
from typing import Callable
# ...

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... (other methods)

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

Ensure that this corrected code is used to replace the existing `add_api_websocket_route` method within the `APIRouter` class. After making this change, re-run the test and verify that the websocket routing is functioning correctly.
