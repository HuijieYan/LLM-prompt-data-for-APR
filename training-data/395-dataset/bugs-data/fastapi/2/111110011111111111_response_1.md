The error occurs because the `add_api_websocket_route` function does not properly add the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute`. This causes the dependency overrides not to work for websockets, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to be modified to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating an `APIWebSocketRoute`.

Here's the corrected function code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # the fixed function
    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

With this fix, the `dependency_overrides_provider` will be passed to the `APIWebSocketRoute`, and the dependency overrides should work as expected for websockets.
