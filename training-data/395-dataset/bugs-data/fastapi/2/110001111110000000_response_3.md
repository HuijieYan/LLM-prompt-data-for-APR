# Corrected function/method
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_2/fastapi/routing.py

# this is the corrected function
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)

```
There appears to be an issue with the test function provided, as it does not directly relate to the implementation of the `add_api_websocket_route` function. Therefore, it's unclear how to correct the error without further context on the `ws_dependency` and the expected behavior of the `websocket.receive_text` method.
