Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the websocket connection, specifically when trying to assert that the received text is "Override".

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug may be occurring because the websocket route is not correctly set up to handle the override dependency for the websocket connection.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the websocket route is properly configured to handle dependency overrides.
2. Ensure that the APIRouter class has a method to correctly handle websocket routes, including the ability to override dependencies.
3. Verify that the websocket connection test is correctly setting up and using the dependency override.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
from fastapi import WebSocket

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides: dict = {}
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides=dependency_overrides)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
