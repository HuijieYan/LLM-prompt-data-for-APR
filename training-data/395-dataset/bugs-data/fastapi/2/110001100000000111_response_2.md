Potential error location:
The bug is likely occurring within the add_api_websocket_route function, specifically in the line where the route is created. It seems like the dependency_overrides_provider is not being added to the APIWebSocketRoute, which is causing the dependency override not to work for websockets.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The APIWebSocketRoute is missing the addition of dependency overrides, which means that when the route is created, it doesn't take into account any dependency overrides set for the endpoint.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the add_api_websocket_route function needs to be modified to ensure that the dependency overrides are added to the APIWebSocketRoute when creating the route. This will allow the dependency overrides to be taken into account when using websockets.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_2/fastapi/routing.py

# corrected add_api_websocket_route function
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider: Callable = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
