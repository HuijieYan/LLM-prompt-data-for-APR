The issue is related to the `add_api_websocket_route` function not adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` to `APIWebSocketRoute`. This results in the override not being taken into account when the WebSocket connection is made.

The potential error location is within the `add_api_websocket_route` function, where it should also handle the `dependency_overrides_provider` for the `APIWebSocketRoute`.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function should be modified to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(
            path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=app.dependency_overrides
        )
        self.routes.append(route)
```

By including the `dependency_overrides_provider=app.dependency_overrides` parameter in the `APIWebSocketRoute` instantiation, the override will be taken into account when the WebSocket connection is made.
