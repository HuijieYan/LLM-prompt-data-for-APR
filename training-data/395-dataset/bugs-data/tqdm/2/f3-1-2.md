The issue description is:

```text
I'm using set_description() with a filename, so I can easily show which file is currently being processed.

If a long filename comes along, I think it's becoming multiline, and then when the next file (that isn't long) comes up, it leaves a ghost trail on the screen, very similar to when you use print() instead of tqdm.write().

I have simply truncated my filenames to a fixed size, but in an ideal world it would be nice to have the option of truncating this automatically as you will know exactly how many characters there are left available on screen once everything else is rendered. I'm simply guessing.

Or, is this a rendering issue that can be fixed and leave the multiline implementation as is?
