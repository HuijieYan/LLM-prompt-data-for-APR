The error occurs when trying to convert a tqdm object to a boolean if it was created with `disable=True`. This raises an AttributeError due to the missing `total` attribute in the `tqdm` object. The `total` attribute is used to determine the length of the iterable, but it's not present when `disable=True`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the scenario where the `disable` parameter is set to `True`. In this case, we should create the `tqdm` object without assigning the `total` attribute, as it's not needed when the progress bar is disabled.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):

    if file is None:
        file = sys.stderr

    if disable:
        self.disable = True
        self.iterable = iterable
        return

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we simply set `self.disable = True` and `self.iterable = iterable` when `disable=True`, and skip initializing the `total` attribute.

This fix ensures that when the `disable` parameter is set to `True`, the `tqdm` object is initialized correctly without requiring the `total` attribute, and therefore does not raise an AttributeError when evaluating as a boolean.

This will address the issue with evaluating `tqdm` as a boolean when `disable` is set to `True`, and the test case should now pass without errors.
