The bug occurs when trying to evaluate a `tqdm` object as a boolean when the `disable` parameter is set to `True`. The error message indicates that the `tqdm` object does not have an attribute 'total', which is likely the cause of the issue.

The `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class does not correctly handle the case when `disable` is set to `True`. This results in missing attribute assignments and leads to the AttributeError when evaluating the object as a boolean.

To fix the bug, the initialization method needs to properly handle the case when `disable` is set to `True`. It should ensure that all necessary attributes are properly assigned regardless of the `disable` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True, file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0, miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3, bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    # Handle case when disable is True
    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        return

    # Rest of the initialization logic for other cases
    # ...
```

By adding a specific handling for the `disable` parameter, the `__init__` method ensures that the object's attributes are properly set, preventing the AttributeError when evaluating the object as a boolean.

With this correction, the bug should be fixed, and evaluating `tqdm` as a boolean should work as expected regardless of the `disable` parameter.
