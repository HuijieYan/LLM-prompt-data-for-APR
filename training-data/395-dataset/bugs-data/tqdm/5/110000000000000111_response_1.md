The issue seems to occur when the `disable` parameter is set to `True` and the `bool()` function is used to check for the existence of the `tqdm` object. This is because the `tqdm` object does not have the attribute `total` when `disable` is set to `True` and the `bool()` function is called.

The potential error location is the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class, specifically the line `return self.total if self.iterable is None else ...`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `disable` is set to `True`, the `total` attribute is not set, which causes the `AttributeError` when accessing `self.total`.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `__len__` method to handle the case when `disable` is `True`. If `disable` is `True`, then return `0`, indicating that the length of the iterable is unknown.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
                 file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
                 miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
                 unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
                 bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
                 unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as original documentation, but corrected code below
    """

    # ... (existing code)

    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.n = initial
        self.total = None  # Set total to None when disable is True
        return

    # ... (existing code)

    # Store the arguments
    self.iterable = iterable
    self.desc = desc or ''
    self.total = total
    if disable:  # Set total to None when disable is True
        self.total = None
    self.leave = leave
    self.fp = file
    self.ncols = ncols
    # ... (remaining code)
```

The change made in the corrected code is to set `self.total` to `None` when `disable` is `True`, indicating that the length of the iterable is unknown. This should fix the issue when using the `bool()` function with a `tqdm` object created with `disable=True`.
