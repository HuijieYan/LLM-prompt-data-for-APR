The error message indicates that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total', which is a common attribute for a progress bar. This error is likely occurring due to the way the 'total' attribute is being initialized in the '__init__' method of the 'tqdm' class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the 'if total is None and iterable is not None' part of the '__init__' method where the 'total' attribute is being set based on the length of the 'iterable'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'total' attribute is not being properly assigned based on the length of the 'iterable'.

To fix the bug, the 'total' attribute should be initialized properly based on the length of the 'iterable' and also handle cases where 'total' is not specified.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
import time

class Tqdm:
    def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
                 file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
                 miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
                 unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
                 bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
                 unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
        """
        (Unchanged parameter explanations...)

        Parameters
        ----------
        (Unchanged parameter explanations...)

        Raises
        ------
        (Unchanged).

        Returns
        -------
        (Unchanged).

        """

        if file is None:
            file = sys.stderr

        # Handle cases where 'total' is not specified
        if total is None and iterable is not None:
            try:
                total = len(iterable)
            except (TypeError, AttributeError):
                total = None

        # Rest of the __init__ method remains the same...

        self.iterable = iterable
        self.desc = desc or ''
        self.total = total
        # (Other attributes follow...)

# The rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the issue in the 'total' attribute initialization has been resolved by ensuring that it is properly assigned based on the length of the 'iterable'. This should fix the AttributeError indicating that the 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'.
