The error message indicates an AttributeError with the message "'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'". This error occurs when the `total` attribute is accessed on the `tqdm` object, but it does not exist.

The code that initializes the `tqdm` object has a lengthy constructor with many parameters. However, it seems that the `total` attribute is not being set correctly during object initialization, leading to the AttributeError when accessing it later.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` function of the `tqdm` class should be reviewed, and the `total` attribute should be properly initialized during object construction.

The corrected `__init__` function for the `tqdm` class:
```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # Store the arguments
    self.iterable = iterable
    self.desc = desc or ''
    self.total = total  # Set the total attribute during initialization
    # (other attributes)
```
By ensuring that the `total` attribute is set properly during the initialization of the `tqdm` object, the AttributeError should be resolved.
