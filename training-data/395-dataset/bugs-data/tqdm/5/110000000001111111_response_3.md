The issue lies in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object when `disable` is set to `True`. This causes the AttributeError when trying to convert the `tqdm` object to a boolean.

The reason behind the bug is that when `disable` is set to `True`, it bypasses the progress bar and does not initialize the attributes required by methods that depend on it.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `__len__` method to handle the case when `disable` is `True` and return a default value in that case.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    # ... (same as before)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : decorated iterator.
    """
    if file is None:
        file = sys.stderr

    if disable is None and hasattr(file, "isatty") and not file.isatty():
        disable = True

    # ... (same as before)

    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        self.total = total  # Add total attribute
        return

    # ... (same as before)

    # NB: Avoid race conditions by setting start_t at the very end of init
    self.start_t = self.last_print_t
```

This modification involves adding the `self.total = total` line within the `if disable` block in the `__init__` method. By doing this, we make sure that the `total` attribute is initialized even when `disable` is set to `True`, as some methods may depend on it.
