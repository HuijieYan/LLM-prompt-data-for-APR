The error message "AttributeError: 'tqdm' object has no attribute 'total'" occurred at line 1568 in the internal function during the test_bool function. This error indicates that the 'tqdm' object being used does not have the attribute 'total'. This is likely causing the issue in the test function where the 'total' attribute is expected to be accessed.

Upon analyzing the function __init__ of the tqdm class, it seems that the assignment of the 'total' attribute is conditional and depends on the 'iterable' input. If 'iterable' is None, then the 'total' attribute should be used. However, in the error message, it appears that the 'total' attribute is not being set correctly when 'iterable' is None.

To address this issue, the 'total' attribute should be directly assigned from the input argument 'total' within the __init__ method. This will ensure that the 'total' attribute is always set, irrespective of the value of 'iterable'.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Set the total attribute directly from the input argument 'total'
    self.total = total

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

With this correction, the 'total' attribute will be initialized properly, and it should resolve the AttributeError when accessing the 'total' attribute.
