The error occurs when trying to convert a tqdm object to a boolean if it was created with `disable=True`. The error is raised because the `__len__` method is trying to access the `total` attribute, which doesn't exist when `disable=True`.

The bug is located in the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class. When `disable` is set to `True`, the method sets the `total` and other attributes, but it does not create the `total` attribute. Consequently, when trying to convert the tqdm object to a boolean, the `__len__` method tries to access the non-existing `total` attribute, causing an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should create the `total` attribute even when `disable=True`. This will ensure that when converting the tqdm object to a boolean, the `total` attribute is present.

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters (unchanged)
    ...
    """

    # Shorten the __init__ method by removing the check for disabled and setting total
    self.iterable = iterable
    self.desc = desc or ''
    self.total = total  # Always set the total attribute
    self.leave = leave
    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By setting the `total` attribute in the `__init__` method regardless of the value of `disable`, we ensure that the tqdm object can be correctly evaluated as a boolean.
