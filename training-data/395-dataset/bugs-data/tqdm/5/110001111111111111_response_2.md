The error message indicates that when `tqdm` object is created with disable=True and then evaluated as a boolean, it raises an AttributeError. This suggests that the problem lies within the initialization of the `tqdm` object when `disable` is set to True.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `disable` is set to True, the `tqdm` object is not properly initialized, causing the AttributeError to be raised when it is evaluated as a boolean.

To fix the bug, the initialization of the `tqdm` object needs to be adjusted to properly handle the case when `disable` is set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable  : iterable, optional
        ... (rest of the parameters unchanged)
    """
    # Check if disable is True, if so, handle it differently
    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        return

    # Rest of the initialization code remains the same
```

The fix involves adding a conditional check at the beginning of the `__init__` method to handle the case when `disable` is set to True. If `disable` is True, the function returns early, bypassing the rest of the initialization logic.
