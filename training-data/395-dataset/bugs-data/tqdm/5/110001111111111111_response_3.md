The test case 'test_bool' is trying to create tqdm objects with different parameters and then evaluate them as booleans. The error message indicates that when the tqdm object is created with disable=True, attempting to evaluate it as a boolean causes an AttributeError because the 'total' attribute is missing.

The potential error location within the problematic function is around the 'disable' condition in the '__init__' method where some attributes might not be set when the 'disable' condition is true.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the 'disable' condition is true, some attributes are not set, leading to missing attribute errors when the object is evaluated as a boolean.

To fix the bug, the 'disable' condition needs to be handled in a way that ensures all necessary attributes are still initialized even when 'disable' is true.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    
    if file is None:
        file = sys.stderr
    
    if disable is None and hasattr(file, "isatty") and not file.isatty():
        disable = True
    
    if kwargs:
        disable = True
        raise TqdmKeyError("Unknown argument(s): " + str(kwargs))
    
    # Preprocess the arguments
    if total is None and iterable is not None:
        try:
            total = len(iterable)
        except (TypeError, AttributeError):
            total = None
    
    # Initialize other attributes even when disable is true
    self.iterable = iterable
    self.desc = desc or ''
    self.total = total
    self.leave = leave
    self.fp = file
    self.ncols = ncols
    self.mininterval = mininterval
    self.maxinterval = maxinterval
    self.miniters = miniters if miniters is not None else 0
    self.dynamic_miniters = miniters is None
    # ... other attributes ...

    # Initialize other counters and attributes
    if disable:
        self.n = initial
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
    else:
        self.n = self.last_print_n = initial
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self.last_print_t = self._time()
        self.start_t = self.last_print_t
```

In the corrected code, we initialize all necessary attributes and counters even when the 'disable' condition is true. This ensures that the 'tqdm' object can be evaluated as a boolean without causing any missing attribute errors.
