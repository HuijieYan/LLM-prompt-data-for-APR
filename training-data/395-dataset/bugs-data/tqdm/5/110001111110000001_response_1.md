The error is occurring in the `test_bool` function in the file `tests_tqdm.py`. The error message indicates that the `tqdm` object has no attribute `total`, which suggests that there is an issue with the `tqdm` class where the `total` attribute is not being set or accessed correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method, which is responsible for initializing the `tqdm` object with various parameters including `total`.

The bug is occurring because the `total` attribute is not being correctly handled when initializing the `tqdm` object. This leads to the `total` attribute not being set, causing the AttributeError when the `__len__` method is called.

To fix the bug, the `total` parameter needs to be correctly handled and assigned when initializing the `tqdm` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True, file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
                 miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it', unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
                 bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None, unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (other parameters)
    total  : int, optional
        The number of expected iterations. If unspecified,
        len(iterable) is used if possible.
    ... (other parameters)
    """
    # ... (other code)

    # Assign the total parameter to the instance's total attribute
    self.total = total

    # ... (other code)
```

In the corrected code, the `total` parameter is correctly assigned to the instance's `total` attribute, ensuring that the `tqdm` object has the necessary attribute when it is used in the test functions.
