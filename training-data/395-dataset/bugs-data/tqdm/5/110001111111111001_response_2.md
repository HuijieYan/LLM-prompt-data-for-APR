The error occurs when the `tqdm` object is being used as a context manager with the `with` statement. The test case checks whether the `tqdm` object evaluates to `True` or `False` based on its `total` attribute.

The potential error location in the provided `__init__` method is the initialization of the `total` attribute. It seems that the `total` attribute might not have been correctly initialized, leading to the AttributeError during the test.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `total` attribute is not correctly set when initializing the `tqdm` object. It might not have been correctly assigned the value provided in the `total` parameter.

To fix the bug, the `total` attribute should be appropriately initialized to the provided value in the `__init__` method of the `tqdm` class.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method for the `tqdm` class:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
             file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
             miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
             unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
             bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
             unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Store the arguments
    self.iterable = iterable
    self.desc = desc or ''
    self.total = total  # Initialize total attribute correctly
    self.leave = leave
    self.fp = file
    self.ncols = ncols
    # ... (other attribute initializations) ...
```

In this corrected method, the `self.total` attribute has been correctly initialized to the provided `total` parameter.

After making this correction, the `tqdm` object should correctly evaluate to `True` or `False` based on its `total` attribute, resolving the AttributeError issue observed in the test.
