The error message indicates that the bug occurs when a tqdm object is created with `disable=True` and then evaluated as a boolean. This leads to an AttributeError because the `__len__` method of the tqdm class tries to access the `total` attribute of the object, which is not available when `disable=True`.

The issue occurs because when `disable=True`, the `__init__` method of the tqdm class does not set the `total` attribute in the `self` object. This causes the AttributeError when trying to access `total` in the `__len__` method.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method needs to be modified to handle the case where `disable=True` and set the necessary attributes appropriately.

Here is the corrected `__init__` method for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, iterable=None, desc=None, total=None, leave=True,
                 file=None, ncols=None, mininterval=0.1, maxinterval=10.0,
                 miniters=None, ascii=None, disable=False, unit='it',
                 unit_scale=False, dynamic_ncols=False, smoothing=0.3,
                 bar_format=None, initial=0, position=None, postfix=None,
                 unit_divisor=1000, gui=False, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (other parameters)

    Returns
    -------
    out  : decorated iterator.
    """

    if file is None:
        file = sys.stderr

    self.disable = disable  # Set disable attribute

    if disable:
        self.iterable = iterable
        self.disable = disable
        self.pos = self._get_free_pos(self)
        self._instances.remove(self)
        self.n = initial
        return

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

The `__init__` method now sets the `disable` attribute, and handles the case where `disable=True`, thereby preventing the AttributeError when evaluating a tqdm object as a boolean.

This fix will resolve the bug and allow tqdm objects created with `disable=True` to be evaluated as booleans without causing an AttributeError.
