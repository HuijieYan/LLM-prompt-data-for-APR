The error occurs when the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function tries to create a new `tqdm` object with the `tqdm(*args, **kwargs)` call. This leads to a TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.

The potential error location is within the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function where `tqdm(*args, **kwargs)` is called. This means that the `tqdm` object is not being created properly and it's returning `None` instead of the expected object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `tqdm` class's `__len__` function is not implemented correctly. It fails to return a proper length when the iterable is missing and returns None instead of 0.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` function needs to be updated to correctly return 0 when the iterable is missing. This can be done using a conditional statement to check for the existence of the iterable and return 0 if it is missing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __len__(self):
    return self.total if self.iterable is None else (
        getattr(self.iterable, "shape", None)[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
        else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
        else getattr(self, "total", None))
```
