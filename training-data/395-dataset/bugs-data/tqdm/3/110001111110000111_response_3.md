The error occurs when the `tqdm` object is being treated as a boolean to determine if there is something passed or not. The issue is related to the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class.

The potential error location is the `__len__` method within the `tqdm` class. The method checks if an iterable has a `shape` attribute, if it supports `__len__`, and if not, it returns the `self.total` attribute if it exists.

The error occurs because the `__len__` method tries to get the length of `self.iterable` without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`. This leads to a `TypeError` when Python tries to treat the `tqdm` object as a boolean.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if the iterable supports `__len__` before trying to get its length.
2. Implement a separate `__bool__` method in the `tqdm` class that returns `True` if `__len__` returns `None`, or just returns `True` always.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

Additionally, adding a separate `__bool__` method to the `tqdm` class would be helpful:

```python
def __bool__(self):
    return True
```

These changes should address the issue and allow the `tqdm` object to be treated as a boolean without encountering a `TypeError`.
