Potential error location: The problematic part of the function is the return statement within the __len__ method.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be caused by the conditional statements within the return statement, which are possibly not handling all possible cases correctly or efficiently.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the iterable is None first, and if it is, return the total attribute.
- If the iterable has a "shape" attribute (e.g., for NumPy arrays), return the length of the first dimension.
- If the iterable has a __len__ method, return its length.
- If none of the above conditions are met, return None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
