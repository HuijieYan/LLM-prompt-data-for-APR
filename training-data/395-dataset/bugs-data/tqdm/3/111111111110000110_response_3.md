# Corrected function/method

```python

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # This is the corrected function
    def __len__(self):
        if self.total is not None:
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is not None:
            if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
                return len(self.iterable)
            elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape") and hasattr(self.iterable, "shape[0]"):
                return self.iterable.shape[0]
            else:
                return 0
        else:
            return 0
```
The corrected function first checks if `total` is not None, and if so, it returns the total. If `total` is None, it then checks if the `iterable` is not None and if it has a `__len__` attribute, and returns the length of the iterable. If these conditions are not met, it returns 0.

This should address the issue described in the error message and the associated detailed issue description.
