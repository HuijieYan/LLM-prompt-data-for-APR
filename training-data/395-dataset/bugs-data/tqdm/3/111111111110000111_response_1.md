The error is occurring in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function within the `test_bool` test case. The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer" is raised when trying to treat `tqdm` as a boolean, due to the buggy implementation of the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class.

The bug is caused by the implementation of the `__len__` method. It tries to get the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`, leading to the error when the iterable is a file type like `_io.BufferedReader`.

To fix this bug, the `__len__` method should be corrected to first check if the iterable supports `__len__` before trying to retrieve the length. If the iterable does not support `__len__`, the method should return the total value if it was explicitly provided for non-measurable iterables. Additionally, a separate `__bool__` method can be implemented to return `True` when `__len__` returns `None`.

Here's the corrected `__len__` and `__bool__` methods for the `tqdm` class:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected methods
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __len__ method
    def __len__(self):
        if self.iterable is None:
            return self.total
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, '__len__'):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return getattr(self, 'total', None)

    # corrected __bool__ method
    def __bool__(self):
        return True  # Always return True to treat tqdm as a boolean
```

By implementing these fixes, the `__len__` method now correctly checks if the iterable supports `__len__` and falls back to `self.total` if it doesn't. Additionally, the `__bool__` method always returns `True` to treat `tqdm` as a boolean.
