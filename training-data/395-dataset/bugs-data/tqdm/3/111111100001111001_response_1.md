Potential error location: The issue might be with the way the function is attempting to calculate the length of the iterable object.

Reason for the bug: The current implementation is not handling different types of iterable objects (e.g., range, list, generator) correctly, leading to incorrect length calculation.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can use a try-except block and handle different types of iterable objects separately to calculate the length accurately.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
