Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the part of the function where it attempts to determine the length of the iterable.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is incorrectly using the conditional operator (ternary operator) to determine the length of the iterable. This leads to ambiguity and incorrect handling of different cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use if-else statements instead of the conditional operator for better readability and handling of different cases.
2. Check for the type of the iterable to determine its length (e.g., using isinstance() for lists, ranges, generators, etc.).

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
