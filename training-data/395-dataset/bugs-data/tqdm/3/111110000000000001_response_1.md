Potential error location: The potential error in the code is in the if-else condition used to determine the length of the iterable object.

Reasons behind the bug: The code is using a complicated if-else condition to determine the length of the iterable object. This makes the code difficult to read and maintain.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Simplify the if-else condition and use a more straightforward approach to determine the length of the iterable object.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the fixed function
    def __len__(self):
        if self.iterable is None:
            return self.total
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
