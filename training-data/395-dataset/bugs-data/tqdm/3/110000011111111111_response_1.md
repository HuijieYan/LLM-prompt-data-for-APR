The bug in the provided code is likely due to a discrepancy between the behavior of the tqdm object and how it is being treated as a boolean in the test cases. The error message indicates that the `__len__` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which cannot be interpreted as an integer. This suggests that the `__len__` method is not returning the expected length of the iterable.

Upon analyzing the code, it can be identified that the `__len__` method is intended to return the length of the iterable when it's present. However, it's not checking if the iterable supports the `__len__` method before calling it.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` method needs to be modified to check if the iterable supports the `__len__` method before calling it. Additionally, it should return the length of the iterable if it's present and return the total if it's been explicitly provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

This updated method first checks if the iterable is `None` and returns the total if it is. If the iterable is not `None`, it checks if it supports the `__len__` method using `hasattr`. If it does, it returns the length of the iterable using `len(self.iterable)`. If the iterable does not support `__len__`, it again returns the total. This approach should address the issues identified in the provided test cases and resolve the bug.
