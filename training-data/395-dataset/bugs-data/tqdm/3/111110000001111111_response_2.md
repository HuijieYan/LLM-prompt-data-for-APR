The error occurs when the `tqdm` object is used with an opened file and the `__len__` method is called to determine the length of the iterable. This causes an error because the opened file doesn't have a length property.

The bug is in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The method is attempting to get the length of the iterable without first checking if the iterable supports the `__len__` method.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to first check if the iterable supports the `__len__` method, and then return the appropriate length based on the type of the iterable.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        else:
            return 0  # Return 0 when length cannot be determined
    else:
        return 0  # Return 0 when iterable is None
```

With this modification, the `__len__` method first checks if `self.total` is not None and returns it if it's set. Then it checks if the iterable supports the `__len__` method and returns the length if it does. If the iterable doesn't support `__len__`, it checks if it has a "shape" attribute and returns its length. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 0 as the length.

This should fix the bug and allow the `tqdm` object to work correctly, especially when used with opened files.
