The buggy function is the __len__ method within the tqdm class. 

The problem with the current implementation is that the conditions in the return statement are not handling the cases properly, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect values being returned.

The conditions are not correctly handling all possible cases for the iterable object, leading to incorrect length calculations.

To fix the bug, we can modify the return statement to properly handle the cases when the iterable is None, when the iterable has a "shape" attribute, when the iterable has a "__len__" attribute, and when the "total" attribute is present.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

By using this updated code, we can properly handle all cases for the iterable object and return the correct length in each scenario.
