Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the else condition of the ternary operator, where it attempts to retrieve the length of the iterable.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the iterable has no defined length or shape attribute. This causes the function to return a None if the iterable does not have either attribute.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by explicitly checking for the existence of the shape attribute and the __len__ method. If they do not exist, we can simply return the length of the iterable using the len() function. Additionally, we can handle the case where the iterable is None and return 0, as an empty iterable has a length of 0.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return 0
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
