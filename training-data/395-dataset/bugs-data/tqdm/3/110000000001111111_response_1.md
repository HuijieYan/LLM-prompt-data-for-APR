The error message "TypeError: object of type '_io.BufferedReader' has no len()" suggests that the issue is with trying to get the length of an iterable that does not support the len() function, specifically when using tqdm with an opened file.

The problematic code is the __len__ method within the function. The issue arises from trying to get the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports the len() function.

The bug occurs because the __len__ method does not handle cases where the iterable does not support the len() function, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the __len__ method to handle cases where the iterable does not support the len() function by checking if the iterable supports the len() function before trying to get the length.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```

This corrected code checks if the total length is provided and returns it if it is. If not, it checks if the iterable supports the len() function and returns its length. If the iterable does not support the len() function, it returns 0. This ensures that the code does not break when trying to get the length of an iterable that does not support the len() function.
