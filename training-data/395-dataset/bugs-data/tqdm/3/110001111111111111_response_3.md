The error occurs when the function `get_bool_for_tqdm` is passed a generator as the `iterable` parameter. The `__len__` function in the `tqdm` class tries to get the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`. This causes a `TypeError` when the generator is passed.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `__len__` function to properly handle cases where the iterable does not support `__len__`. Additionally, we should implement a separate `__bool__` function as suggested in the GitHub issue description.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` and `__bool__` functions:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tqdm_3/tqdm/_tqdm.py

def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0  # Default length if iterable does not support __len__

def __bool__(self):
    return True  # Always return True, as __bool__ behavior is not clearly defined for tqdm
```

With these changes, the `__len__` function will correctly handle cases where the iterable does not support `__len__`, and the implemented `__bool__` function will always return `True`, avoiding the error raised when a generator is passed.

These changes should fix the bug and make the `tqdm` object correctly handle iterable objects and boolean checks.
