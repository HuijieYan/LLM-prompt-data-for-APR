The error message indicates a TypeError in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function. The error occurs when the `tqdm` object `t` is being used with the `bool()` function.

The potential error lies in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The current implementation does not handle the case when `self.iterable` is `None`. This results in a `NoneType` object being returned, leading to the TypeError when used with `bool()`.

The bug occurs because the __len__ method does not properly handle the case when `self.iterable` is None. It should also check if the `total` attribute is present and return its value if it exists.

To fix this bug, the `__len__` method should be updated to handle the case when `self.iterable` is None and also to check for the presence of the `total` attribute.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
