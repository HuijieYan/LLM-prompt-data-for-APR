The potential error in the original code lies in the __len__ function. The current implementation is convoluted and attempts to return different values based on different conditions. This might lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect return values.

The potential bug in the original __len__ function is that it's trying to handle different cases in a single line, which can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior. It's better to handle each case separately and explicitly return the correct length based on the type of the iterable.

To fix the bug, we can modify the __len__ function to explicitly check for the type of the iterable and return its length accordingly. Here's the corrected code for the __len__ function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, '__len__'):
            return len(self.iterable)
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, 'shape'):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
    return getattr(self, 'total', 0)
```

With this corrected code, we explicitly check for the presence of __len__ attribute and 'shape' attribute in the iterable, and return the length accordingly. If neither is present, we return the value of 'self.total'. This approach should handle the different types of iterables correctly and provide the expected behavior for the tqdm class.
