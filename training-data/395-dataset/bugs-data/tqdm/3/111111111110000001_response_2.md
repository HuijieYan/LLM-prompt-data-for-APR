The error message indicates a TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function. This suggests that the `tqdm` object is not being properly initialized within the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function, resulting in a None object.

The potential error location is the initialization of the `tqdm` object within the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function.

The buggy function `__len__(self)` makes use of the `self.iterable` attribute to determine its length. However, it does not handle the case where `self.iterable` might be None, and that's what's causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `self.iterable` is None, and if it is, then return `self.total` if it is not None, and return 0 otherwise.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total if self.total is not None else 0
    else:
        return (self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape")
                else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__")
                else getattr(self, "total", None))
```
