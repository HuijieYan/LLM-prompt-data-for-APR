In the given code and error message, the issue seems to be with the `tqdm` class and the `__len__` method. The test function `test_bool` asserts that the output of `get_bool_for_tqdm((x for x in []))` should be `False`, but it raises a `TypeError`.

The reason behind this error is that the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class could be returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing the TypeError when the `bool` function is trying to interpret it as an integer.

To fix this issue, the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class should be modified to return the length of the iterable if it exists. If the iterable does not exist, it should return the value of the `total` attribute.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

By making these changes, the `__len__` method should now handle the cases properly and avoid returning a `NoneType` object.
