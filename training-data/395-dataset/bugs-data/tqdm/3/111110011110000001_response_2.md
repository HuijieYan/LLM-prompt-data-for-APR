The test_bool() function includes a call to the get_bool_for_tqdm() function, which uses the tqdm class. The error message indicates a TypeError caused by trying to interpret a NoneType object as an integer.

Upon inspection of the problematic function __len__(self), it is clear that the bug is occurring due to the value of self.iterable being None, and the subsequent code handling this case by returning an attribute of self as the total if it exists.

The bug occurs because the None object is not an iterable object and does not have a "shape" attribute, and thus the len(self.iterable) if statement is triggered, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can explicitly check if self.iterable is None and return the value of self.total if it exists. Otherwise, we can return 0.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __len__(self):
        return self.total if self.iterable is None else \
            len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__") else 0
```
