The error occurs in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The function returns the length of the iterable if it exists but does not handle the case where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method.

The bug occurs because the `__len__` method does not handle the case where `self.iterable` does not support the `__len__` method. The code should first check whether the iterable has the `__len__` attribute before trying to retrieve its length.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to first check if the iterable has a `__len__` attribute. If it does, then we can return the length of the iterable. Otherwise, we should return the `total` attribute if it exists, or the length of the iterable if it is not None.

Here's the corrected `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        elif self.total is not None:
            return self.total
        else:
            return 0
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", 0)
```

This corrected code first checks if `self.iterable` is not None. If it is not, it then checks if the iterable has the `__len__` attribute. If it does, it returns the length of the iterable. If not, it falls back to the `total` attribute and returns its value. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 0. If `self.iterable` is None, it returns the value of `self.total`, defaulting to 0 if `self.total` is not set.
