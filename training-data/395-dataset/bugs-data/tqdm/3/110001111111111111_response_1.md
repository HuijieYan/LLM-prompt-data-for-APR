The error occurs in the __len__ method of the buggy function. The buggy function is trying to return the length of the iterable, but it does so in a way that leads to a TypeError when the iterable is not of a specific type. 

The bug occurs because the code does not account for the case where the iterable does not support the __len__ method, resulting in a TypeError when trying to interpret a NoneType object as an integer.

To fix the bug, the __len__ method should be modified to handle cases where the iterable does not support the __len__ method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

In the corrected __len__ method, we added a check for whether the iterable supports the __len__ method. If it does, the length is returned using len(self.iterable). If it doesn't, the method returns the total attribute or None. This modification will handle cases where the iterable does not support the __len__ method, preventing the TypeError that was previously occurring.
