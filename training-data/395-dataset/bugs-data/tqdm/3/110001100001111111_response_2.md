Potential error location: The issue is likely with the logic within the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The method attempts to determine the length of the iterable, but it does not handle non-measurable iterables properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `__len__` method does not properly handle non-measurable iterables and does not have a separate `__bool__` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to handle non-measurable iterables and return the correct length if the total was passed for non-measurable iterable.
2. Implement a separate `__bool__` method that returns `True` if `__len__` returned `None`, indicating that the iterable is unmeasurable and no explicit total was provided.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)

def __bool__(self):
    return True  # Always return True for __bool__ method
```
