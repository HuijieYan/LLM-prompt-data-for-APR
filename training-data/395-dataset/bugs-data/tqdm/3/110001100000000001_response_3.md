Potential Error:
The potential error lies in the way the function tries to determine the length of the iterable. It first checks if the iterable has a "shape" attribute, and if not, it then checks if the iterable has a "__len__" attribute. If neither condition is met, it returns the "total" attribute of the object itself.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle all potential cases for determining the length of the iterable. It only accounts for cases where the iterable has a "shape" attribute or a "__len__" attribute, which may not cover all possible iterables.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should first check if the iterable is None, and if not, it should then check if the iterable has a "__len__" attribute. If not, it should then return the length of the iterable using the built-in len() function. This approach covers all potential cases for determining the length of the iterable.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        try:
            return len(self.iterable)
        except TypeError:
            return self.total
```
