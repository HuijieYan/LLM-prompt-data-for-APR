The error message indicates a TypeError in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function, specifically when it tries to return the boolean value of `t` which is a NoneType. This suggests that the issue lies within the function `get_bool_for_tqdm`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `bool(t)` call inside `get_bool_for_tqdm` function. The `bool()` function is being called on a variable `t` that is of NoneType, which is causing the TypeError.

The bug occurred because there is no proper length checking for the `iterable` if it is None. This causes it to return `None` instead of `0` as the length, leading to `NoneType` being passed to `bool()`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__len__` method of the class to properly handle the length calculation when `iterable` is None.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return getattr(self, "total", 0)
    else:
        return self.iterable.shape[0] if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape") \
            else len(self.iterable) if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__") \
            else getattr(self, "total", None)
```

In this corrected code, when `self.iterable is None`, it returns `self.total` if it exists, otherwise it returns 0 to indicate the length. This ensures that when `self.iterable` is None, the length is properly handled.
