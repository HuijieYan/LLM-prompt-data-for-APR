The error occurs at the line `return bool(t)` within the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function. This error arises because the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` object is not implemented properly.

The `__len__` method should return the length of the iterable if `total` was not provided, or `total` if it was provided. However, the current implementation of the `__len__` method checks if `self.iterable` has `shape` or `__len__`, but it does not handle the case where `total` was provided explicitly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__len__` method to handle the case when `total` is explicitly provided and return the length based on that.

Here's the corrected `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return 0
```

With this corrected implementation, the `__len__` method will properly handle the case when `total` is provided and return the length based on that.
