The error message indicates that the issue occurs when trying to treat the tqdm object as a boolean, resulting in a TypeError. The problem is specifically within the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class.

The bug occurs because the `__len__` method does not consider cases where the iterable does not support the `__len__` attribute. This results in a TypeError when the object of type `_io.BufferedReader` does not have a length.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` method needs to check if the iterable supports the `__len__` attribute before trying to retrieve its length. If it does not support `__len__`, it should use the value of `self.total` if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

By making these changes, the `__len__` method will now correctly handle cases where the iterable does not support the `__len__` attribute.
