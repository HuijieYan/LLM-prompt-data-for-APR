The error in the provided function is that it tries to return different values based on different conditions within a single return statement. This makes the code unclear and prone to bugs.

To fix this, we can use simple if-else conditions to check the different cases and return the appropriate value for each case.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

This corrected code uses if-else conditions to check the different cases and return the appropriate value for each case, making the function more readable and less prone to bugs.
