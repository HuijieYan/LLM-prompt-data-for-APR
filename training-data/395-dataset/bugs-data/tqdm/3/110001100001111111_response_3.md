Potential error location: The problematic section of the code is the return statement in the __len__ method of the tqdm class.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because in the return statement, it tries to get the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports __len__.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the iterable supports __len__ before getting the length of the iterable.
2. Implement a separate __bool__ method to return True if __len__ returned None, or simply return True always.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
In this corrected code, we have added the necessary checks to ensure that we get the length of the iterable only if it is supported. We have also retained the original functionality of returning self.total if the iterable is None.
