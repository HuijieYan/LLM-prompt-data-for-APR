The error message indicates a TypeError related to a return statement within the function `get_bool_for_tqdm`. This suggests that the `tqdm` object being returned is of type `None`, which cannot be interpreted as an integer.

The potential error location within the `__len__` function is the sequence of conditional statements that determine the length of `self.iterable`.

The bug occurs because the length of `self.iterable` is not being correctly determined in some cases, leading to the `tqdm` object being set to `None`, causing the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statements to accurately determine the length of `self.iterable` in all cases.

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
