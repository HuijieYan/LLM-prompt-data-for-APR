The error message provided in the GitHub issue indicates that the issue is related to the __len__ method of the tqdm object, and it cannot be treated as bool when used with an opened file.

The potential error location within the code is the __len__ method, where the length of the iterable is being incorrectly calculated.

The bug occurred because the __len__ method does not correctly handle cases where the iterable may not support the __len__ method. Additionally, the method does not check if the total was explicitly passed for a non-measurable iterable.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
- Check if the iterable supports the __len__ method before trying to get its length.
- Return the correct length if the total was passed for a non-measurable iterable.
- Implement a separate __bool__ method that returns True if __len__ returned None, indicating an unmeasurable iterable and no explicit total.

Here's the corrected code for the __len__ method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0  # or any default length if iterable length cannot be determined
```

By implementing the above changes, the __len__ method now correctly handles cases where the iterable may not support the __len__ method and returns the correct length if the total was passed for a non-measurable iterable.
