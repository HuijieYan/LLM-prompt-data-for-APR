Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the conditional statement of the function where it checks for the type of iterable and attempts to return the length accordingly.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is trying to return the length of the iterable based on different conditions, but the conditions are not properly checked. The return statement is also ambiguous, which may lead to incorrect results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of the iterable using `isinstance()` instead of `hasattr()` to ensure accurate type checking.
2. Use separate conditional statements to handle different cases more clearly.
3. Use a default `else` case for handling unexpected scenarios.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif isinstance(self.iterable, range):
        return len(self.iterable)
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
