The error message indicates that the issue is related to the `tqdm` object not being treated as a boolean when used with an opened file. The specific error is `TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `__len__` method, which is used to determine the length of the iterable and is called when the `tqdm` object is treated as a boolean.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__len__` method tries to get the length of `self.iterable` without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`. This leads to a `TypeError` when the `tqdm` object is treated as a boolean and the `__len__` method returns `None`.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` method should be modified to first check if the iterable supports `__len__` before attempting to get the length of `self.iterable`. Additionally, it would be beneficial to implement a separate `__bool__` method to return `True` if `__len__` returns `None`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
    return getattr(self, "total", None)

def __bool__(self):
    return True
```

In this corrected code, the `__len__` method first checks if the iterable supports `__len__` and returns the length accordingly. If neither of the conditions is met, it returns `self.total` or `None`. Additionally, the `__bool__` method is implemented to always return `True`.
