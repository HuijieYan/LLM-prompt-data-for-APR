The error occurs in the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The error message indicates that the `__len__` method is trying to get the length of `self.iterable` without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`. This causes an error when trying to treat tqdm as a boolean to determine if there is something passed or not.

The main issue is that the `__len__` method is not handling different iterable types correctly. It should first check if the iterable supports `__len__`, and if not, then check if the total was explicitly passed for non-measurable iterable.

To fix this issue, the `__len__` method should be updated to handle different iterable types correctly. It should first check if `self.iterable` supports `__len__` using the `hasattr` method, and if not, then check if the total was explicitly passed. If none of these conditions are met, it should return None.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    elif self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    else:
        return None
```

This updated method checks if the iterable supports `__len__` before trying to get its length, and if not, it checks if the total was explicitly passed. If neither condition is met, it returns None. This should resolve the issue and allow the `tqdm` object to be treated as a boolean when used with opened files.
