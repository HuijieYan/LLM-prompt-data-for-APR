The error message indicates that the issue occurs when trying to treat tqdm as a boolean. The TypeError 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer' suggests that the buggy function is returning None instead of a valid integer value in some cases.

The potential error location is within the __len__ method of the tqdm class. This method seems to be incorrectly handling cases where the iterable does not support the __len__ attribute.

The bug occurs because the __len__ method does not properly handle cases where the iterable does not support the __len__ attribute. Instead of gracefully handling this situation, it returns None, which leads to the TypeError when python tries to interpret None as an integer.

To fix the bug, the __len__ method should be modified to properly handle cases where the iterable does not support the __len__ attribute. It should return the length of the iterable if it has a valid length or return the total value if it was explicitly provided. If no total was provided and the iterable is not measurable, a default value of 1 can be returned.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.total is not None:
        return self.total
    elif self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            # Default length for non-measurable iterable
            return 1
    else:
        # Default length if both total and iterable are None
        return 1
```

This corrected __len__ method checks if the total is provided and returns it if available. If the iterable supports __len__, it returns the length of the iterable. In cases where the iterable is not measurable, it returns a default length of 1. This approach addresses the issues identified and should resolve the bug.
