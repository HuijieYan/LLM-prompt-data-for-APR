The error occurs in the __len__ method of the tqdm library. The function is trying to return the length of the iterable, but it incorrectly checks if the iterable has a "shape" attribute or a "__len__" method. The error message indicates that a TypeError occurs when trying to interpret a NoneType object as an integer.

The issue arises because the function doesn't properly handle cases where the iterable does not have a length attribute or method. As a result, it incorrectly returns None in some cases, leading to the TypeError when the length is interpreted as an integer.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the iterable has a "shape" attribute. If it does, it should return the length of the shape attribute. If not, it should check if the iterable has a "__len__" method, and if so, return the length using the __len__ method. If neither of these conditions is met, it should return self.total or 0 if total is not specified.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total if hasattr(self, "total") else 0
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return self.total if hasattr(self, "total") else 0
```
