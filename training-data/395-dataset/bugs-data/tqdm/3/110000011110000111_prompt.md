# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
tqdm object cannot be treated as bool when used with opened file
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
My use-case was to display upload progress when sending file with POST using requests library. I wrapped opened file with tqdm:

f = open(filename, 'rb')
t = tqdm(f)
requests.post(url, data=t)
And I got an error:

<...>
  File "/tmp/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/requests/sessions.py", line 467, in request
    data = data or {},
  File "/tmp/env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tqdm/_tqdm.py", line 753, in __len__
    else len(self.iterable)) if self.iterable is not None \
TypeError: object of type '_io.BufferedReader' has no len()
Turned out that _io.BufferedReader doesn't know file's length.
Okay, I passed file length to tqdm explicitly:
t = tqdm(f, total=os.path.getsize(filename))
Nothing changed.

Now, the problem happens when requests tries to treat tqdm as boolean to determine if there something passed or not. Tqdm has no __bool__, so Python falls back to __len__. And __len__ is buggy in that it tries to get len(self.iterable) without checking if the iterable supports __len__.

I think it would be good to:
(1) return correct length if total was passed for non-measurable iterable; and probably
(2) implement separate __bool__ which would return True if __len__ returned None - e.g. if tqdm was passed an unmeasurable iterable and no explicit total. Or just return True always.
```
