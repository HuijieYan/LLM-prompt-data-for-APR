The error occurs within the `__len__` method. This method is attempting to return the length of the iterable without properly checking if the iterable supports the `__len__` method.

The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when the `bool(t)` is called within the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function. This suggests that the `t` object is not properly implementing the `__bool__` or `__len__` method.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `__len__` method to properly handle cases where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method. Additionally, we should consider implementing a `__bool__` method for the `t` object to handle boolean casting.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", 0)
```

With this modification, the method properly checks if the iterable supports the `__len__` method. If not, it returns the `total` attribute or 0 if `total` is not available.

To handle the boolean casting, we can implement a `__bool__` method for the `t` object:

```python
def __bool__(self):
    return bool(len(self))
```

This will ensure that the `t` object can be treated as a boolean when necessary.

By making these adjustments, the issues with the `__len__` method and the boolean casting should be resolved.
