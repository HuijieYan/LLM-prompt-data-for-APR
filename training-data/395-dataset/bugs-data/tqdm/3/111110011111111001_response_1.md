The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer" occurs when the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function is called with a generator as an argument. This suggests that the `__len__` method within the `tqdm` class is returning a `NoneType` object when it should be returning an integer.

The potential error location is the `__len__` method within the `tqdm` class.

The bug is likely caused by the `__len__` method trying to return the `total` attribute as an integer without checking if it exists. Additionally, the condition for checking the existence of the `total` attribute might not be sufficient, resulting in a `NoneType` being returned instead of an integer.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly check for the existence of the `total` attribute and return 0 if it does not exist. This would prevent a `NoneType` from being returned.

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # the corrected function
    def __len__(self):
        if hasattr(self, "total"):
            return self.total
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        else:
            return 0
```

The corrected `__len__` method explicitly checks for the existence of the `total` attribute and returns it if it exists. If it does not exist, it checks for the existence of `__len__` and `shape` attributes of the `iterable` and returns their length or shape accordingly. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 0. This ensures that an integer value is always returned.
