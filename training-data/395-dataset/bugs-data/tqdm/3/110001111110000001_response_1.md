Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur in the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function, particularly when it is called with an empty iterable (i.e., `get_bool_for_tqdm((x for x in []))`).

Reasons behind the Bug:
The buggy `__len__` function does not handle the case where the iterable is empty properly, resulting in a `NoneType` object being returned, which causes the TypeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the iterable is empty and return `0` in that case.
2. Validate the iterable and its length before attempting to use it to avoid the TypeError.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return 0
```
