The error message indicates that the `TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer` is being raised within the `get_bool_for_tqdm` function. This is likely related to the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class, as this method returns the length of the iterable.

The buggy function `__len__` in the `tqdm` class is trying to return `self.total` if `self.iterable` is None, but it is not handling the case when `self.iterable` is not None correctly. It should follow the usual conditional expressions syntax, and it should return the length of the iterable if it has a `shape` attribute or a `__len__` attribute. 

The buggy code did not consider all the relevant conditions and caused the TypeError during the test case when the iterable was a generator.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `__len__` method to handle all the cases correctly based on the nature of the `iterable`. We will also check if `self.total` is available, and if it is, we will return it as the default value.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class tqdm(Comparable):
    """
    Decorate an iterable object, returning an iterator which acts exactly
    like the original iterable, but prints a dynamically updating
    progressbar every time a value is requested.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected __len__ method
    def __len__(self):
        if self.total:
            return self.total
        elif self.iterable is None:
            return 0
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return 0
```

This corrected code will handle all cases where `self.iterable` is None, has a `shape` attribute, has a `__len__` attribute, or when `self.total` is available. It should address the TypeError that was occurring in the test case.
