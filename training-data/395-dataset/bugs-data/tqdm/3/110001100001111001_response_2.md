The issue with the buggy function is that it's trying to return the length of the iterable object 'self.iterable' if it exists, otherwise, it returns the value of 'self.total' if it exists. However, the condition to return the length of the iterable object is not written correctly.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to correctly return the length of the iterable object when it exists, and if it doesn't exist, then return the value of 'self.total'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is not None:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return 0  # or any appropriate default value if the length is unknown
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

In this corrected function:
- We first check if the iterable object 'self.iterable' is not None.
- If it exists, we then check if it has a 'shape' attribute, and return the length based on that.
- If it doesn't have a 'shape' attribute, we check if it has a '__len__' attribute and return the length based on that.
- If 'self.iterable' does not have a 'shape' or '__len__' attribute, we can return a default value (in this case, 0) or any other appropriate value if the length is unknown.
- If 'self.iterable' is None, we return the value of 'self.total' if it exists.
