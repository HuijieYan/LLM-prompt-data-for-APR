Potential error location: The bug is likely in the conditional statement where the length of the iterable is checked. The function is returning the total if the iterable is None instead of checking if it's a range.

Reason for the bug: The current code does not properly handle the case when the iterable is a range or other types of iterable objects.

Approach to fixing the bug: We need to modify the conditional statement to properly handle different types of iterable objects.

Corrected code:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    else:
        if hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
            return self.iterable.shape[0]
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return getattr(self, "total", None)
```
