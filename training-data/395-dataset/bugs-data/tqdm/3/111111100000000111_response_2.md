1. The test case involves using the tqdm function to display the upload progress when sending a file with the POST method using the requests library. The error occurs when the file is wrapped with tqdm, and then used in the requests.post method.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__len__` method, where it tries to get the length of `self.iterable` without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`.
3. The bug occurs because the `__len__` method assumes that the iterable supports `__len__` without checking it beforehand. In this specific case, the `_io.BufferedReader` object does not have a length, and the `__len__` method does not handle this case properly.
4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `__len__` method to check if the iterable supports `__len__`, and if not, then fallback to the `total` attribute. Additionally, we can implement a separate `__bool__` method that returns True if `__len__` returns None, making the tqdm object behave like a boolean.
5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)

def __bool__(self):
    return True
```
