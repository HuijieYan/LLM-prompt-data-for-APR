The error message suggests that the issue lies within the `__len__` method of the `tqdm` class. The error occurs when the `__len__` method is called on an iterable object that does not have a length, leading to a `TypeError`.

The bug occurs because the `__len__` method tries to get the length of the iterable without checking if the iterable supports the `__len__` attribute. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to get the length of an iterable that does not have a length.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` method needs to be updated to handle cases where the iterable does not have a length. It should first check if the iterable supports the `__len__` attribute before trying to get its length. If the iterable does not support `__len__`, it should return the total length if it was passed explicitly. Additionally, it's a good idea to implement a separate `__bool__` method that returns `True` if `__len__` returns `None`, and always returns `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method in the `tqdm` class:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)

def __bool__(self):
    return True
```
