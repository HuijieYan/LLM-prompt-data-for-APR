The error message indicates that the issue is occurring at the point where the `bool` method is being called on the `tqdm` object. The error is a `TypeError` stating that the 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.

The bug is likely occurring in the `__len__` method defined in the `tqdm` class. This method is supposed to return the length of the iterable if available, or the specified total if provided. However, the bug is likely due to the fact that the function does not properly handle cases where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if the iterable supports the `__len__` method using the `hasattr` function before attempting to get the length.
2. If the iterable does not support `__len__`, and a total has been specified, return the total value.
3. Implement a separate `__bool__` method that returns `True`, as suggested in the issue description, to handle cases where `__len__` returns `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` and `__bool__` methods:

```python
class tqdm(Comparable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __len__(self):
        if self.iterable is None:
            return self.total
        elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
            return len(self.iterable)
        else:
            return self.total

    def __bool__(self):
        return True
```

With these changes, the `__len__` method should correctly handle cases where the iterable does not support `__len__`, and the new `__bool__` method should always return `True` as suggested in the issue description.
