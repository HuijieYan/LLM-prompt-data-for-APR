The issue seems to stem from the `__len__` method of the tqdm object, where it tries to get the length of the `iterable` without checking if the iterable supports `__len__`.

The potential error location within the `__len__` method is the part where it tries to get the length of the iterable without first checking if the iterable supports the `__len__` method. This can cause the TypeError, particularly when the iterable is a file object.

The bug is occurring because the `__len__` method does not have proper checks to handle cases where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method, such as file objects.

To fix the bug, the `__len__` method needs to first check if the iterable supports the `__len__` method before trying to get the length. Additionally, a separate `__bool__` method should be implemented to return True if `__len__` returns None, or just return True always.

Here's the corrected code for the `__len__` method:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
```

And the implementation of the `__bool__` method:

```python
def __bool__(self):
    return True
```

These corrections will address the bug and ensure that the `__len__` method handles cases where the iterable does not support the `__len__` method, and the `__bool__` method correctly handles the boolean behavior of the tqdm object.
