The error occurs when the requests library tries to treat tqdm as a boolean to determine if something was passed or not. Tqdm has no __bool__, so Python falls back to __len__. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the __len__ method. The __len__ method is trying to get the length of the self.iterable without checking if the iterable supports __len__.

To fix the bug, we can implement a separate __bool__ method that returns True if __len__ returns None, or always returns True. Additionally, we should return the correct length if total was passed for a non-measurable iterable.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __len__(self):
    if self.iterable is None:
        return self.total
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "shape"):
        return self.iterable.shape[0]
    elif hasattr(self.iterable, "__len__"):
        return len(self.iterable)
    else:
        return getattr(self, "total", None)
    
def __bool__(self):
    return True
```
