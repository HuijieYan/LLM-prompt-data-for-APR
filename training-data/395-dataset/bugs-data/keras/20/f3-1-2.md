The docs of the Conv2DTranspose layer mention dilation_rate but the call to the backend does not include dilation_rate. The backend function conv2d_transpose would not even support it.
In TensorFlow it would be a call to the separate function atrous_conv2d_transpose.
Is there something else going on in Keras that dilates the kernels, perhaps in the base class (i.e. Conv2D)?

In the following test at least the output of a Conv2DTranspose layer with dilation_rate == (2, 1) has the same shape as with dilation_rate == (1, 1).

from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Conv2DTranspose
from keras import backend as K
import numpy as np

assert K.backend() == "tensorflow"
assert K.floatx() == "float32"
assert K.image_data_format() == 'channels_last'

kernel_size = (2, 1)
strides = (1, 1)
padding = 'valid'
input_shape = (6, 1, 1)
inp = Input(shape=input_shape)
ct_1_1 = Conv2DTranspose(1, kernel_size, strides=strides,
                         padding=padding, dilation_rate=(1, 1))(inp)
ct_2_1 = Conv2DTranspose(1, kernel_size, strides=strides,
                         padding=padding, dilation_rate=(2, 1))(inp)
model = Model(inputs=inp, outputs=[ct_1_1, ct_2_1])
model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='mse')

data_in = np.random.random((1, *input_shape))

result = model.predict(data_in)
print('data_in.shape  ', data_in.shape)
print('result[0].shape', result[0].shape)
print('result[1].shape', result[1].shape)
output:

data_in.shape   (1, 6, 1, 1)
result[0].shape (1, 7, 1, 1)
result[1].shape (1, 7, 1, 1)
But if I understand transposed convolution correctly, the output shapes should differ. So perhaps by accident Conv2DTranspose currently does not support dilation at all?

Describe the problem
Well using tf.keras.Conv2DTranspose I noticed the dilation function did not dilate. No matter what size of dilation you choose the result is the same.

I did found the problem in keras as well but I did not now if I should report it here too: keras-team/keras#8159
