The error indicates that there is an index out of range, specifically at line 503 of the file `training_utils.py`.

The code at fault is checking the shape of `y` array without considering the possibility that `y` may be a 1D array. This causes an index out of range error when attempting to index the second dimension of `y`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition to check if `y` is at least 2D before attempting to access the second dimension. If `y` is not at least 2D, we can assume it's a 1D array and proceed accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '
                             'should be None or "temporal". '
                             'Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 2:  # Check if y is at least 2D
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape ' +
                             str(y.shape) + '. Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of ' +
                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to ' +
                             'outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, ' +
                             'you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, ' +
                             'you should specify sample_weight_mode="temporal" ' +
                             'in compile(). If you just mean to use ' +
                             'sample-wise weights, make sure your ' +
                             'sample_weight array is 1D.')

    # Remaining code unchanged
