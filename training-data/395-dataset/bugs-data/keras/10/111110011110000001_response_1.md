The error is occurring in the function `standardize_weights` when the variable `y` is being accessed with `y.shape[1]`. This error is triggered by the `IndexError: tuple index out of range` error message, which suggests that the function is trying to access an index that does not exist in a tuple.

This bug is likely caused by the assumption that `y` is a 2D array, where the second dimension represents the classes or timesteps. However, in the test case, `y` is a 1D array, causing the function to fail when trying to access `y.shape[1]`.

To fix this bug, we can check the dimensionality of `y` and handle the case where it is 1D differently. We can conditionally check the length of `y.shape` and set the classes based on the dimensionality.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
from keras import backend as K

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    # [Existing code...]
    
    if len(y.shape) == 1:
        y_classes = y
    elif len(y.shape) > 1:
        if y.shape[1] > 1:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
        elif y.shape[1] == 1:
            y_classes = np.reshape(y, y.shape[0])
        else:
            y_classes = y
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid shape of y')

    # [Existing code...]
```

By checking the dimensionality of `y` and setting `y_classes` accordingly, we can avoid the `IndexError` when accessing `y.shape[1]`. This fix allows the function to handle both 1D and 2D arrays passed as `y`.
