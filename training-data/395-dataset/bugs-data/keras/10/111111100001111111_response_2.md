The bug in the code is that it doesn't handle sample weights and class weights properly. When the sample_weight is provided, it should return the sample_weight directly. If class_weight is provided, it should map the class labels to the weights and return the weights accordingly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle sample_weight and class_weight separately and return the appropriate weights according to the conditions.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
from tensorflow.python.keras import backend as K

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '
                             'should be None or "temporal". '
                             'Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for '
                             'an input with shape ' +
                             str(y.shape) + '. '
                             'Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of '
                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to '
                             'outputs that are at least 2D, i.e. that have '
                             'a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '
                             'In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, '
                             'you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '
                             'In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, '
                             'you should specify '
                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal" '
                             'in compile(). If you just mean to use '
                             'sample-wise weights, make sure your '
                             'sample_weight array is 1D.')
    
    if sample_weight is not None:
        return sample_weight
    elif class_weight is not None:
        weights = np.array([class_weight[i] for i in y])
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=K.floatx())
```
