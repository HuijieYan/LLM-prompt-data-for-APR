The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect handling of sample weights and class weights. The function is designed to standardize weights for model targets, taking into account sample weights and class weights.

In the first buggy case, the function should return the `sample_weight` array, but the code doesn't handle this case correctly. It is failing the condition `if sample_weight is not None` and directly returns the sample_weight. This will skip the rest of the class_weight-related logic even if sample_weight is provided.

In the second and third buggy cases, the function incorrectly handles class weights. It raises ValueError when `class_weight` is a dictionary and the dimension of `y` is greater than 2.

To fix the bug, the function logic should consider the case when `sample_weight` is not None and handle the class_weight logic correctly based on the dimension of `y`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
import keras.backend as K

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode should be None or "temporal". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape ' +
                             str(y.shape) + '. Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, you should specify sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile(). If you just mean to use sample-wise weights, make sure your sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: `class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '.'
                             'Expected sample_weight with rank less than or equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))
        if y.shape[:sample_weight.ndim] != sample_weight.shape:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) +
                             ' for an input with shape ' +
                             str(y.shape) + '. '
                             'sample_weight cannot be broadcast.')
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 2:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for 3+ dimensional targets.')
        if len(y.shape) == 2:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
        else:
            y_classes = y
        weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] if cls in class_weight else 1.0 for cls in y_classes])
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=K.floatx())
