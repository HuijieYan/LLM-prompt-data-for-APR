The error message indicates an IndexError at line 503 in the 'training_utils.py' file, which suggests that there's an issue related to index manipulation in the function `standardize_weights()`.

The potential error location seems to be in the following line:
```python
if y.shape[1] > 1:
```
This line tries to access the second index of `y.shape`, which can cause an `IndexError` if `y.shape` doesn't have a second dimension.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code assumes that `y` always has at least two dimensions, causing an `IndexError` when trying to access the second dimension of `y.shape`.

To fix the bug, we should first check the dimensionality of `y` before trying to access its second dimension.

Below is the corrected code for the `standardize_weights()` function:

```python
def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode ' 'should be None or "temporal". ' 'Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for ' 'an input with shape ' + str(y.shape) + '. ' 'Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of ' 'sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to ' 'outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have ' 'a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. ' 'In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, ' 'you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. ' 'In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, ' 'you should specify ' 'sample_weight_mode="temporal" ' 'in compile(). If you just mean to use ' 'sample-wise weights, make sure your ' 'sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: ' '`class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '.' 'Expected sample_weight with rank ' 'less than or equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))

        if len(y.shape) > 1:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
        else:
            y_classes = y

        weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes if cls in class_weight])

        if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
            existing_classes = set(y_classes)
            existing_class_weight = set(class_weight.keys())
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` must contain ' 'all classes in the data.' ' The classes %s exist in the data but not in ' '`class_weight`.' % (existing_classes - existing_class_weight))
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=K.floatx())
```

In the corrected function, we have modified the condition for accessing the second dimension of `y.shape` by adding a check for dimensionality of `y`. We also handle the case separately when `y` has only one dimension.
