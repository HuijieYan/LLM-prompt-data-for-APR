The error occurs when the `standardize_weights` function is called with `class_weight` provided and `sample_weight` as None. 

The cause of the error is due to accessing the second dimension of the `y` array without checking if it exists. This causes an IndexError when `y.shape[1]` is accessed. The function assumes that `y` has a second dimension, but in the given input, `y` is a 1D array with shape (5,). 

To fix this bug, the function should first check the dimensionality of `y` before trying to access its second dimension.

Here's the corrected `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '
                             'should be None or "temporal". '
                             'Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 2:
            if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
                raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                                 str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '
                                 'In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, '
                                 'you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
        else:
            if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
                raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                                 str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '
                                 'In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, '
                                 'you should specify '
                                 'sample_weight_mode="temporal" '
                                 'in compile(). If you just mean to use '
                                 'sample-wise weights, make sure your '
                                 'sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: '
                      '`class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '.'
                             'Expected sample_weight with rank '
                             'less than or equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))

        if np.prod(y.shape[:len(sample_weight.shape)]) != np.prod(sample_weight.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) +

                             str(y.shape) + '. '
                             'sample_weight cannot be broadcast.')
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 1:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for '
                             '2+ dimensional targets.')
        return np.array([class_weight.get(cls, 1.0) for cls in y])
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=np.float32)
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], 1), dtype=np.float32)
```

This corrected function first checks the dimensionality of `y` before using indexes to access its shape and elements, avoiding the IndexError that occurred in the original function. Additionally, it checks the shape compatibility between `sample_weight` and `y` to ensure proper broadcasting.
