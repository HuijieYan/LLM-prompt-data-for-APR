    # Arguments
        y: Numpy array of model targets to be weighted.
        sample_weight: User-provided `sample_weight` argument.
        class_weight: User-provided `class_weight` argument.
        sample_weight_mode: One of `None` or `"temporal"`.
            `"temporal"` indicates that we expect 2D weight data
            that will be applied to the last 2 dimensions of
            the targets (i.e. we are weighting timesteps, not samples).

    # Returns
        A Numpy array of target weights, one entry per sample to weight.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of invalid user-provided arguments.
