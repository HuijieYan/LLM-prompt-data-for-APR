The issue in the `standardize_weights` function seems to be with handling the `sample_weight` parameter. There are multiple conditions and checks based on the `sample_weight_mode`, shape, and dimensions of `sample_weight`.

The error message points towards the condition related to `sample_weight_mode`. The function checks if `sample_weight_mode` is not `None` and not equal to `"temporal"`. If it doesn't meet this condition, it raises a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the condition related to `sample_weight_mode` is correctly handled and validated. Another issue is the handling of `sample_weight` and `class_weight` when they are both provided. This combination is incorrect and should be flagged.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
from keras import backend as K

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode should be None or "temporal". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape ' + str(y.shape) + '. Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to outputs that are at least 2D, i.e. that have a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 1D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use sample-wise sample weights, you should specify sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile(). If you just mean to use sample-wise weights, make sure your sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: `class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. Expected sample_weight with rank less than or equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))

        if y.shape[:sample_weight.ndim] != sample_weight.shape:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + ' for an input with shape ' + str(y.shape) + '. sample_weight cannot be broadcast.')
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 1:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for 2+ dimensional targets.')
        if y.ndim > 1:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=-1)
        else:
            y_classes = y
        weights = np.asarray([class_weight.get(cls, 1.0) for cls in y_classes])
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones(y.shape, dtype=K.floatx())
```
