The error message indicates an "IndexError: tuple index out of range" in the function `standardize_weights` at line 503 when `len(y.shape) > 2`. This suggests that there is an attempt to access an index that does not exist within the shape of the array `y`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where it checks the shape of `y` to make sure it satisfies certain conditions. This check occurs at multiple points in the function.

The error occurs because the function assumes a specific shape for `y` without proper verification. This assumption leads to an IndexError when the shape of `y` does not match the expected format.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle different shapes of `y` and ensure that the code does not attempt to access indices that do not exist within the shape of the array.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '
                            'should be None or "temporal". '
                            'Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for '
                            'an input with shape ' +
                            str(y.shape) + '. '
                            'Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of '
                            'sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to '
                            'outputs that are at least 2D, i.e. that have '
                            'a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                            str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '
                            'In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, '
                            'you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight) != len(y):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with length ' +
                            str(len(sample_weight)) + '. '
                            'It should have the same length as the number of samples in y.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        return sample_weight
    elif class_weight is not None:
        y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=-1)
        weights = np.array([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes])
        return weights
    else:
        return np.ones((len(y),), dtype=K.floatx())
```

In this corrected code, additional checks have been added to ensure that the shape and length of `y` and `sample_weight` are validated properly to avoid IndexError. The modifications also include handling `y` with different shapes and ensuring that the weight array returned matches the expected shape and length.
