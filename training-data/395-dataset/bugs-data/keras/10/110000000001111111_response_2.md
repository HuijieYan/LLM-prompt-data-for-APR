The potential error in the provided function is in the logic for handling `sample_weight` and `class_weight`. In buggy cases 1 and 3, the function should return the `sample_weight`, but it currently does not. Additionally, the function does not handle the `class_weight` correctly, as it should return the weights computed based on the `class_weight` dictionary.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not properly consider the cases where `sample_weight` and `class_weight` are provided.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to return the `sample_weight` if it is provided and to compute the weights based on the `class_weight` if it is a dictionary.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,

    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '

        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for '
                             'an input with shape ' +

                             'outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have '
                             'a time dimension.')
    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +

                           'sample-wise weights, make sure your '
                          'sample_weight array is 1D.')
        return sample_weight
    elif class_weight:
        if len(y.shape) > 2:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for '
                             '3+ dimensional targets.')
        if y.shape[1] > 1:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
        elif y.shape[1] == 1:

                             'all classes in the data.')
