The error message indicates an "IndexError: tuple index out of range" on line 503 of the "training_utils.py" file, specifically in the condition `if y.shape[1] > 1:`. This implies that the shape of the 'y' variable is causing the issue.

The bug occurs because the shape of 'y' does not have a second dimension (y.shape[1]) when the code attempts to access it. This causes an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that 'y' has at least 2 dimensions before attempting to access the second dimension.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    # ... (other existing code)

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: '
                      '`class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '.'
                             'Expected sample_weight with rank '
                             'less than or equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))

        if y.ndim > 1 and sample_weight.ndim == 1:
            sample_weight = np.expand_dims(sample_weight, axis=-1)

        if y.shape[:sample_weight.ndim] != sample_weight.shape:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) +
                             ' for an input with shape ' +
                             str(y.shape) + '. '
                             'sample_weight cannot be broadcast.')
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 2:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for '
                             '3+ dimensional targets.')
        if y.ndim > 1:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
        else:
            y_classes = y

        weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes
                              if cls in class_weight])

        if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
            existing_classes = set(y_classes)
            existing_class_weight = set(class_weight.keys())
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` must contain '
                             'all classes in the data.'
                             ' The classes %s exist in the data but not in '
                             '`class_weight`.'
                             % (existing_classes - existing_class_weight))
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=K.floatx())
```

In the corrected code, I added a check to ensure that if 'y' has more than 1 dimension and 'sample_weight' has only 1 dimension, we expand the dimensions of 'sample_weight' to match 'y'. This ensures that the shape compatibility is maintained.
