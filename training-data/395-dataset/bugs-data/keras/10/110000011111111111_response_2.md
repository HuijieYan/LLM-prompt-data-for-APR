The error occurs when the function attempts to access y.shape[1] on line 503, which raises an IndexError since y.shape returns a 1D tuple and y.shape[1] is invalid.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly assumes that y.shape will always have at least 2 dimensions. This assumption leads to errors when the function attempts to access y.shape[1] without checking the actual shape of y.

To fix the bug, we need to add proper checks to ensure that the code handles cases where y.shape does not have at least 2 dimensions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    """Performs sample weight validation and standardization.

    Everything gets normalized to a single sample-wise (or timestep-wise)
    weight array.

    # Arguments
        y: Numpy array of model targets to be weighted.
        sample_weight: User-provided `sample_weight` argument.
        class_weight: User-provided `class_weight` argument.
        sample_weight_mode: One of `None` or `"temporal"`.
            `"temporal"` indicated that we expect 2D weight data
            that will be applied to the last 2 dimensions of
            the targets (i.e. we are weighting timesteps, not samples).

    # Returns
        A Numpy array of target weights, one entry per sample to weight.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of invalid user-provided arguments.
