The error occurs because the function `standardize_weights` is not handling the case where `class_weight` is provided, but `y` is a 1D array (i.e., `len(y.shape) == 1`). The function is trying to access `y.shape[1]` which causes the IndexError because `y` is only 1D.

To fix this, the function should handle the case where `class_weight` is provided and `y` is a 1D array separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    """Performs sample weight validation and standardization.

    Everything gets normalized to a single sample-wise (or timestep-wise)
    weight array.

    # Arguments
        y: Numpy array of model targets to be weighted.
        sample_weight: User-provided `sample_weight` argument.
        class_weight: User-provided `class_weight` argument.
        sample_weight_mode: One of `None` or `"temporal"`.
            `"temporal"` indicated that we expect 2D weight data
            that will be applied to the last 2 dimensions of
            the targets (i.e. we are weighting timesteps, not samples).

    # Returns
        A Numpy array of target weights, one entry per sample to weight.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of invalid user-provided arguments.
    """

        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode should be None or "temporal". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape ' + str(y.shape) + '. Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '.

            weights = np.array([class_weight[y_val] for y_val in y])
        else:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1) if y.shape[1] > 1 else np.reshape(y, y.shape[0])
            weights = np.array([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes if cls in class_weight])

    if len(weights) != len(y):
        raise ValueError('Weights must contain one entry per sample to weight.')
    
    return weights
```

In the corrected code, the `standardize_weights` function now handles the case where `class_weight` is provided and `y` is a 1D array separately by calculating the class weights for each element in `y`. This would resolve the IndexError and address the handling of class weights for 1D arrays.
