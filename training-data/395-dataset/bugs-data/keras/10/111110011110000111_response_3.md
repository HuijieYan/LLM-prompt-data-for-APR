The error occurs because the function `standardize_weights` is trying to access `y.shape[1]` which results in an IndexError. This happens when the length of `y.shape` is less than 2.

The bug occurs because the code doesn't handle the scenario where `y` is a 1D array. This causes the function to try to access an index that doesn't exist, leading to the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check the dimensions of `y` in the function and handle the 1D array case.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
import keras.backend as K

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '
                             'should be None or "temporal". '
                             'Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for '
                             'an input with shape ' +

                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to '
                             'outputs that are at least 3D, i.e. that have '
                             'a time dimension.')

        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: '
                      '`class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '.'

        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 2:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for '
                             '3+ dimensional targets.')
        y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1) if len(y.shape) > 1 else y  # Handling 1D array case
        weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes
                              if cls in class_weight])

        else:
            return np.ones(y.shape, dtype=K.floatx())
```

In the corrected code, we handle the 1D array case by checking the dimensions of `y` and adjust the logic accordingly. This should fix the bug and prevent the IndexError from occurring.
