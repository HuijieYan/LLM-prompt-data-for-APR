The test case 'test_sample_weights' is calling the function 'standardize_weights' with the argument 'class_weight', but the function is expecting 'class_weight' instead. This mismatch is causing the function to fail with an 'IndexError' when trying to access 'y.shape[1]'.

The potential error location is the line:
```python
weights = training_utils.standardize_weights(y, class_weight=class_weights)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is expecting the argument to be named 'class_weight', but the test case is providing 'class_weights' instead. This mismatch in the argument names is causing the function to fail and raise an 'IndexError' when it tries to access an index out of range in the 'y' array.

To fix the bug, the function call in the test case should be modified to:
```python
weights = training_utils.standardize_weights(y, class_weight=class_weights)
```

Here's the corrected code for the 'standardize_weights' function:

```python
def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    """Performs sample weight validation and standardization.

    Everything gets normalized to a single sample-wise (or timestep-wise)
    weight array.

    # Arguments
        y: Numpy array of model targets to be weighted.
        sample_weight: User-provided `sample_weight` argument.
        class_weight: User-provided `class_weight` argument.
        sample_weight_mode: One of `None` or `"temporal"`.
            `"temporal"` indicates that we expect 2D weight data
            that will be applied to the last 2 dimensions of
            the targets (i.e. we are weighting timesteps, not samples).

    # Returns
        A Numpy array of target weights, one entry per sample to weight.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of invalid user-provided arguments.
    """
    # existing code remains the same
