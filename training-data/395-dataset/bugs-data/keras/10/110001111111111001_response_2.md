The error is occurring at the line `if y.shape[1] > 1:` within the `standardize_weights` function. The error message indicates an `IndexError` with the message "tuple index out of range", suggesting that the function is trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the `y.shape` tuple.

The potential error location is in the `elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):` block of code, specifically at the line `if y.shape[1] > 1:`. The issue is that `y.shape` is a tuple `(5,)` which means it only has one dimension, and accessing `y.shape[1]` is trying to access the second element of the tuple, which doesn't exist.

This issue occurs because the code is assuming that `y` is at least 2D, but in this case, it's only 1D. This assumption is causing the function to break.

To fix this bug, we should update the code to handle the case when `y` is 1D. Specifically, when `y` is 1D, we should directly use the `class_weight` values without any further manipulation.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        # Check and handle sample_weight_mode
        # (code remains unchanged)

    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '
                             'In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, '
                             'you should specify '
                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal" '
                             'in compile(). If you just mean to use '
                             'sample-wise weights, make sure your '
                             'sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: '
                      '`class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '.'

        if sample_weight.shape[0] != y.shape[0]:  # Update the condition to check shape
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) +
                             ' for an input with shape ' +
                             str(y.shape) + '. '
                             'Sample_weight array shape should match input shape.')
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) < 2:  # Handle 1D case
            weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y

        else:

                y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
            elif y.shape[1] == 1:
                y_classes = np.reshape(y, y.shape[0])
            else:
                y_classes = y

            weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes
                                  if cls in class_weight])

            if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
                existing_classes = set(y_classes)
                existing_class_weight = set(class_weight.keys())
                raise ValueError('`class_weight` must contain '
                                 'all classes in the data.'

        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=K.floatx())
``` 

After making this change, the function should be able to handle the 1D case properly and the error encountered in the test case should be resolved.
