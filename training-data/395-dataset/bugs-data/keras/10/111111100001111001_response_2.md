The error message from the buggy function indicates that it is expecting a 3D input while it should be working with a 1D input. This suggests that there might be an issue with the conditional checks related to the input dimensions. After analyzing the code and the provided test cases, it is clear that the bug is caused by the conditional checks for the input shapes and modes.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for the input shapes and modes need to be modified. Specifically, the condition `len(y.shape) < 3` is problematic, as it incorrectly raises an error for 1D input. Similarly, the condition `len(sample_weight.shape) != 2` also needs to be adjusted to accommodate 1D sample weights.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings

def standardize_weights(y,

                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '
                             'should be None or "temporal". '

        if len(y.shape) < 2:

                             'outputs that are at least 2D, i.e. that have '

                             'you should specify '
                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal" '
                             'in compile(). If you just mean to use '
                             'sample-wise weights, make sure your '

```
In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been adjusted to properly handle 1D inputs for both the sample weights and the model targets. Additionally, the class weights calculation has been modified to ensure correct handling of 1D target arrays.
