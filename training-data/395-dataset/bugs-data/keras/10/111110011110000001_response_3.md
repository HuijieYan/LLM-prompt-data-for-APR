The error indicates an IndexError at line 503 in the `training_utils.py` file, which is related to the `y.shape[1]` statement. This suggests that there might be an issue with accessing the second dimension of the input array `y`, leading to an IndexError.

The potential error location is in the block of code where the function checks for the presence of `class_weight` and the dimensions of `y`.

The bug occurs because when checking for the shape of `y`, the code erroneously assumes the shape of `y` to have more than one dimension for the check `y.shape[1] > 1`. This assumption leads to an IndexError when attempting to access the second dimension of `y`. Additionally, the handling of `class_weight` may not be correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, the function needs to first check if `y` has more than one dimension before attempting to access the second dimension. Additionally, the logic for handling `class_weight` needs to be revised to ensure that it aligns with the dimensionality of `y`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
