The bug occurs in the `standardize_weights` function. In the first case, the bug seems to be in the check for the dimensions of the `sample_weight` variable and the input `y`. The function seems to be expecting a 3D array for `y`, but in this case, it's a 1D array. Hence, it throws a ValueError.

In the second and third cases, the same issue arises, affecting the class weight calculation in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditions that check the dimensions of `y` and `sample_weight`. Instead of strictly checking for a 3D array, we should check if the dimensions match for broadcasting or support the required operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
def standardize_weights(y,
                        sample_weight=None,
                        class_weight=None,
                        sample_weight_mode=None):
    # ... existing documentation ...

    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode '
                             'should be None or "temporal". '
                             'Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if sample_weight is not None:
            if len(sample_weight.shape) != len(y.shape):
                raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                                 str(sample_weight.shape) +
                                 ' for an input with shape ' +
                                 str(y.shape) + '. '
                                 'sample_weight cannot be broadcast.')
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 1:
            y_classes = y
        else:
            y_classes = np.reshape(y, y.shape + (1,))
        
        weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes
                              if cls in class_weight])

        if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
            existing_classes = set(y_classes.flatten())
            existing_class_weight = set(class_weight.keys())
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` must contain '
                             'all classes in the data.'
                             ' The classes %s exist in the data but not in '
                             '`class_weight`.'
                             % (existing_classes - existing_class_weight))
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones(y.shape, dtype=K.floatx())
```

In the corrected code, the checks for the dimensions of `y` and `sample_weight` have been modified to allow broadcasting and to handle cases where the input shape does not strictly adhere to the original assumptions. Additionally, the computation of `y_classes` has been adjusted to handle cases where the input shape is not strictly 2D.
