The error occurs when the `class_weight` argument is provided without the `sample_weight` argument. This is because the function incorrectly assumes that there will be at least 2 dimensions in the `y` array, and it tries to access `y.shape[1]`, resulting in an IndexError when `y` has only one dimension.

To fix this bug, the function should first check the shape of the input `y` to determine whether it has one or two dimensions before attempting to access `y.shape[1]` or perform any operations based on the assumption of a second dimension.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('sample_weight_mode should be None or "temporal". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array for an input with shape ' + str(y.shape) + '. Timestep-wise sample weighting (use of sample_weight_mode="temporal") is restricted to outputs that are at least 2D, i.e. that have a time dimension.')
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, you should specify sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile(). If you just mean to use sample-wise weights, make sure your sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: `class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. Expected sample_weight with rank less than or equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))

        if y.ndim > 1 and y.shape[1] > 1:
            y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1)
        else:
            y_classes = y

        weights = np.asarray([class_weight[cls] for cls in y_classes if cls in class_weight])

        if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
            existing_classes = set(y_classes)
            existing_class_weight = set(class_weight.keys())
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` must contain all classes in the data. The classes %s exist in the data but not in `class_weight`.' % (existing_classes - existing_class_weight))

        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=np.float)
        else:
            return np.ones(y.shape, dtype=np.float)
```

In the corrected code:
- The function first checks the dimensionality of the input `y`.
- It then correctly accesses `y.shape[1]` only if `y` has more than one dimension.
- The function uses `ndim` instead of `len(y.shape)` for improved readability and consistency.
- Proper conditions have been added to handle single-dimensional inputs and avoid index out of range errors.

With these corrections, the function should now handle both `sample_weight` and `class_weight` arguments correctly without causing any errors.
