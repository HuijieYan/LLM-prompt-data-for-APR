Potential error location: The function appears to have multiple if-else conditions and checks for the shape of the sample_weight, y, and other arrays. There is also an issue with the warning message.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect conditional checks, mishandling of the sample_weight_mode, and improper validation of input shapes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure the conditional checks are correct and cover all possible scenarios.
2. Properly validate the input shapes and handle the sample_weight_mode.
3. Fix the warning message to provide accurate information to the user.
