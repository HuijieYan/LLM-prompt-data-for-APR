The error message states that there is an IndexError at line 503 of the training_utils.py file. This implies that there is an issue with the index used, likely in relation to the dimensions of the array 'y'. 

Upon analyzing the code, the issue is likely at this line:
```python
if y.shape[1] > 1:
```
The bug occurs because the code assumes that the input array 'y' has at least 2 dimensions, which may not always be true.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where 'y' has only one dimension. We can use a conditional check to ensure that 'y' has sufficient dimensions before attempting to access its shape.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import warnings
from keras import backend as K

def standardize_weights(y, sample_weight=None, class_weight=None, sample_weight_mode=None):
    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        # ... (existing validation code remains unchanged)
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '. '
                             'In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, '
                             'you should specify '
                             'sample_weight_mode="temporal" '
                             'in compile(). If you just mean to use '
                             'sample-wise weights, make sure your '
                             'sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: '
                      '`class_weight` argument will be ignored.')
    
    if sample_weight is not None:
        if len(sample_weight.shape) > len(y.shape):
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight with shape' +
                             str(sample_weight.shape) + '.'
                             'Expected sample_weight with rank '
                             'less than or equal to ' + str(len(y.shape)))

        if y.ndim > 1 and sample_weight.ndim > 1 and y.shape[-1] != sample_weight.shape[-1]:
            raise ValueError('Dimension mismatch: y.shape[-1] = ' + str(y.shape[-1]) +
                             ' and sample_weight.shape[-1] = ' + str(sample_weight.shape[-1]))
        
        if np.prod(y.shape[:-sample_weight.ndim]) != np.prod(sample_weight.shape):
            raise ValueError('Sample_weight shape cannot be broadcast to match y shape.')

        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):
        if len(y.shape) > 2:
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for '
                             '3+ dimensional targets.')
        y_classes = np.argmax(y, axis=1) if y.ndim > 1 else y
        weights = np.asarray([class_weight.get(cls, 1) for cls in y_classes])
        if len(weights) != len(y_classes):
            missing_classes = set(y_classes) - set(class_weight.keys())
            raise ValueError('`class_weight` must contain weights for all classes in the data. '
                             'Missing classes: %s' % missing_classes)
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones(y.shape, dtype=K.floatx())
``` 

In the corrected code:
- The conditional checks for dimensions and shape matching have been updated to handle cases where 'y' has fewer dimensions.
- Proper checks for validity and conformance have been added to ensure the correct usage of sample weights and class weights.
- The conditional checks for shape matching and broadcasting have been enhanced to cover a broader range of scenarios.
