The error occurs when the function `standardize_weights` is called with the `class_weights` argument, but no `sample_weight` argument. The error message indicates an `IndexError` relating to the shape of the input data `y`.

The bug is likely located in the conditional statement that checks if `class_weight` is a dictionary and then further checks the shape of `y`. It seems that the shape of `y` is being accessed incorrectly, leading to the `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to correctly handle the case where `class_weight` is a dictionary and `y` has a shape greater than 1. Additionally, we should ensure that both `sample_weight` and `class_weight` are handled correctly when they are both present.

Below is the corrected code for the `standardize_weights` function:

```python
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
import numpy as np
import warnings

    if sample_weight_mode is not None:
        if sample_weight_mode != 'temporal':
            raise ValueError('"sample_weight_mode should be None or "temporal". Found: ' + str(sample_weight_mode))
        if len(y.shape) < 3:

        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 2:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weighting, you should pass a 2D sample_weight array.')
    else:
        if sample_weight is not None and len(sample_weight.shape) != 1:
            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + '. In order to use timestep-wise sample weights, you should specify sample_weight_mode="temporal" in compile(). If you just mean to use sample-wise weights, make sure your sample_weight array is 1D.')

    if sample_weight is not None and class_weight is not None:
        warnings.warn('Found both `sample_weight` and `class_weight`: `class_weight` argument will be ignored.')

    if sample_weight is not None:

            raise ValueError('Found a sample_weight array with shape ' + str(sample_weight.shape) + ' for an input with shape ' + str(y.shape) + '. sample_weight cannot be broadcast.')
        return sample_weight
    elif isinstance(class_weight, dict):

            raise ValueError('`class_weight` not supported for 2+ dimensional targets.')
        weights = np.array([class_weight[y_val] for y_val in y])
        return weights
    else:
        if sample_weight_mode is None:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0],), dtype=K.floatx())
        else:
            return np.ones((y.shape[0], y.shape[1]), dtype=K.floatx())
