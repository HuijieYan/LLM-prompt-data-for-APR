The issue description is:

```text
On Windows, open method writes line terminator of '\r\n' on default. (When writing output to the stream, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep.)
But, we should use line terminator of '\n' on all platform. (Do not use os.linesep as a line terminator when writing files opened in text mode)

The default behavior of open method causes to add no-need blank lines to each line of csv file viewing by excel or csv library.

In [1]: import csv

In [2]: with open('foo.csv', 'r') as f:
   ...:     reader = csv.reader(f)
   ...:     for row in reader:
   ...:         print(row)
   ...:

['', '', '', '', '']
['0', '0.92615', '0.244615294', '0.9675', '0.10786899']
['', '', '', '', '']

I don't have environments of Unix and Mac OS, so I wrote code to effect only for Windows.
Please check behavior on other environments and write code for the environments.

Thank you.
