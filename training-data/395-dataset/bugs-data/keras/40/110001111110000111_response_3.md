1. The test case `test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape` creates a recurrent RNN layer with two LSTM cells and then calls the `compute_output_shape` method of this layer. The expected output shapes are defined in `expected_output_shape`.

2. The potential error location is within the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class in the `recurrent.py` file.

3. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly computing the output shape, leading to discrepancies between the actual and expected output shapes. This is likely due to incorrect handling of state sizes and sequences within the function.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Retrieve the state size properly for each cell in the RNN layer.
   - Properly handle the return state and return sequences to compute the output shape accordingly.

5. Corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method in `recurrent.py`:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]
    
    state_sizes = [self.cell.state_size] * len(self.cell)
    output_dim = [size[0] if hasattr(size, '__len__') else size for size in state_sizes]

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim[-1])
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim[-1])
    
    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], dim) for dim in output_dim]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

This code retrieves the state sizes for each cell in the RNN layer, handles the return state and return sequences correctly, and computes the output shape accordingly.
