The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected output shape and the actual output shape. The difference is at index 3, where the shapes are different: (None, 6) != (None, 3). This suggests that there is an issue with the computation of the output shape in the `compute_output_shape` function.

Upon analysis of the function, it seems that the issue lies in the portion of the code where the `state_shape` is being computed if `self.return_state` is True. It appears that the function is not handling the computation of the state shape correctly, resulting in the mismatch with the expected output shape.

The reason behind the bug is that the computation of the state shape is not accounting for the correct dimensions when constructing the state_shape.

To fix the bug, the state shape should be constructed based on the state dimensions and the number of states. This can be achieved by iterating through the states and constructing the state_shape using the output_dim and input_shape dimensions.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this correction, the `state_shape` is constructed based on the dimensions of the states, and the function should now compute the correct output shape, resolving the error in the test function.
