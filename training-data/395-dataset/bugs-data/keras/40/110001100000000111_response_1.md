Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the lines that calculate the "state_shape" variable and the return statement for "state_shape".

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The variable "self.states" is used in the line "state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]", but "self.states" is not defined in the code provided. It seems like "self.states" should refer to the states of the cell, but the code does not handle it correctly.
2. The code attempts to iterate over "self.states", but it's not clear what "self.states" represents or if it's even intended to be iterable.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different variable or attribute that correctly represents the states of the cell.
2. Ensure that the variable or attribute used to represent the states of the cell is properly handled and defined.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    # Assuming the attribute representing the states of the cell is named "cell_states"
    # Modify the code accordingly if the actual attribute name is different
    if self.return_state and hasattr(self.cell, 'cell_states'):
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.cell.cell_states]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
