The issue with the function `compute_output_shape` is the incorrect handling of the `state_shape` variable. The `states` variable is undefined and is used as if it were a list inside the return statement. This causes a TypeError due to the attempt to iterate over the undefined variable.

The initial issue occurs because `states` is used as both a function name and a variable name, which is not allowed in Python. This leads to confusion and the incorrect use of `states`.

To fix this, we need to create a new variable to hold the state shapes, and then return it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
