The potential error in the provided code is in the section where the `state_shape` is calculated. The issue seems to be that the list of `self.states` is initialized with `None` values, which does not match the expected output from the `cell.state_size` or `cell.state_size[0]`. This results in mismatched dimensions with the `state_shape`.

The bug is caused due to the incorrect initialization of `self.states`. The `self.states` should correspond to the states of the RNN cells but they are initialized with `None` values, resulting in an incorrect `state_shape`.

To fix this bug, the `self.states` should be set based on the state size of the RNN cells. It seems that there is a discrepancy in the number of states, which can be addressed by creating and appending states based on the length of `cell.state_size`.

Below is the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        if isinstance(input_shape, list):
            input_shape = input_shape[0]
    
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]

            # Initialize self.states based on the length of cell.state_size
            self.states = [None for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        else:
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size

            # Initialize self.states based on the single state value
            self.states = [None]

        if self.return_sequences:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

        if self.return_state:
            # Create state_shape based on the length of self.states
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]
            return [output_shape] + state_shape
        else:
            return output_shape
```
