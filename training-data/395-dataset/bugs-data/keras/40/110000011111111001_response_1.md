The error is occurring because the state_shape should have four instances of (None, 6) instead of three instances of (None, 6) and one instance of (None, 3).

The bug is in the conditional statement for `self.return_state`. When `self.return_state` is True, the state_shape should have the same dimensions as output_dim, which means it should have the same value for each state.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement for `self.return_state` to create a list of the same shape and dimensions as output_dim.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
