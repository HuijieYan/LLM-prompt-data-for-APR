The error occurs because the buggy function `compute_output_shape` is not handling the `states` attribute correctly. It is returning the wrong values for `state_shape` which is causing the test case to fail.

The potential error location is in the computation of the `state_shape` within the `compute_output_shape` function.

The bug occurs because the `state_shape` is being incorrectly computed based on the number of states available, rather than the state sizes. This causes the mismatch in the expected output shapes leading to the test case failure.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the `self.cell.state_size` and create a list of shape tuples based on the first dimension of the input shape and the respective state sizes.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        state_sizes = self.cell.state_size
    else:
        state_sizes = [self.cell.state_size]

    output_dim = state_sizes[0]

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], size) for size in state_sizes]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compute the `state_shape` based on the sizes of the states, and the test case should pass successfully.
