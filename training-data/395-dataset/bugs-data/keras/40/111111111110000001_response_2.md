The code contains a bug in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class. This method is supposed to compute the output shape of the RNN layer based on the input shape and layer configuration.

The error message from the test function indicates a mismatch in the output shapes between the expected and actual outputs. Specifically, at index 3, the dimensions are mismatched: (None, 6) != (None, 3).

The bug in the code is that the calculation of state shapes is incorrect, leading to an incorrect comparison with the expected output shapes.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the state shape calculations are correct for both return state and non-return state scenarios.
2. Calculate the state shape based on the input shape and layer configuration.
3. Modify the variable `state_shape` to correctly represent the state shapes as per the input shape and layer configuration.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(input_shape, '__len__'):
        batch_size = input_shape[0]
    else:
        batch_size = input_shape

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_dim = self.cell.units
        step_dim = input_shape[1]
        output_shape = (batch_size, step_dim, output_dim)
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.units
        output_shape = (batch_size, output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(batch_size, self.cell.units) for _ in range(len(self.cell.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In this corrected method, the output shapes and state shapes are calculated based on the input shape and layer configuration, to ensure consistency and correctness in the output.
