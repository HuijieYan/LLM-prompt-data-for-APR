The test case `test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape` is checking the output shape of the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class. It creates an instance of the `RNN` class initialized with two LSTM cells, set to return both the state and the sequences.

The error message indicates that the expected output shape does not match the actual output shape, specifically in the index 3 where the expected output shape has `(None, 3)` but the actual output shape has `(None, 6)`.

The problem is likely within the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class. It seems that for the state shape, the expected value is not being computed correctly based on the test case.

The bug occurs in the `compute_output_shape` method when determining the shape of the states. It appears that the dimension of the states is not being correctly handled, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual shapes.

To fix the bug, you need to correctly compute the shape of the states based on the cells and the return state settings.

Below is the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], dim) for dim in self.cell.state_size]
        else:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size)]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected code, the shape of the states is computed based on the `cell.state_size` and whether it has multiple dimensions. The output shapes are correctly determined based on the return sequences and return state settings.
