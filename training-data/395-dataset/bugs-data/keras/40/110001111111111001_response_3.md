The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output of the `compute_output_shape` function and the actual output. Specifically, at index 3, the expected value is `(None, 3)` but the actual output is `(None, 6)`, causing the assertion error.

The problematic section of code is related to the computation of `state_shape`. The number of elements in `state_shape` should match the number of elements in `self.states`. In this case, `self.states` is `[None, None, None, None]`, so `state_shape` should contain four elements of shape `(None, 6)`.

The bug occurs because the `state_shape` calculation does not consider the length of `self.states`, which is causing the mismatch in the output.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to create `state_shape` based on the length of `self.states`, which should be the same length as the `self.cell.state_size`.

Here is the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.states]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this revised implementation, `state_shape` will be computed based on the length of `self.states`, ensuring that it matches the expected output.
