Potential Error Location:
The issue is with the `compute_output_shape` function in the `RNN` class. The way it handles the `return_state` condition and the `state_shape` calculation seems to be incorrect.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the `return_state` condition properly. Additionally, the `state_shape` calculation seems to be incorrect as well.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `self.states` is a list.
2. Correctly calculate the `state_shape` based on the length of `self.states`.
3. Handle the `return_state` condition properly to ensure the function returns the correct output shape.

Corrected Code:
```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    output_dim = self.cell.state_size
    if isinstance(output_dim, list):
        output_dim = output_dim[0]

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
