The error message is showing that the `compute_output_shape` function is not returning the expected output shape. Specifically, at index 3, it is expecting a shape of (None, 3) but receiving (None, 6).

The potential error location within the `compute_output_shape` function is the calculation of the `state_shape` when `self.return_state` is True. It appears that the `state_shape` is not being calculated correctly, resulting in an incorrect output shape.

The bug occurred because the `state_shape` is being calculated based on the number of states, but it should be based on the state dimensions.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to iterate over the states and get their dimensions to form the `state_shape` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = []
        for state in self.states:
            state_shape.append((input_shape[0], state))
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
