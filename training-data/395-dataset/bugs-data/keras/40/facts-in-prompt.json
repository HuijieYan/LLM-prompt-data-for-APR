A RNN cell is a class that has:\n            - a `call(input_at_t, states_at_t)` method, returning\n                `(output_at_t, states_at_t_plus_1)`. The call method of the\n                cell can also take the optional argument `constants`, see\n                section \"Note on passing external constants\" below.\n            - a `state_size` attribute. This can be a single integer\n                (single state) in which case it is\n                the size of the recurrent state\n                (which should be the same as the size of the cell output).\n                This can also be a list/tuple of integers\n                (one size per state). In this case, the first entry\n                (`state_size[0]`) should be the same as\n                the size of the cell output.\n            It is also possible for `cell` to be a list of RNN cell instances,\n            in which cases the cells get stacked on after the other in the RNN,\n            implementing an efficient stacked RNN.\n        return_sequences: Boolean.

If True, the last state\n            for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial\n            state for the sample of index i in the following batch.\n        unroll: Boolean (default False).\n            If True, the network will be unrolled,\n            else a symbolic loop will be used.\n            Unrolling can speed-up a RNN,\n            although it tends to be more memory-intensive.\n            Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.\n        input_dim: dimensionality of the input (integer).\n            This argument (or alternatively,\n            the keyword argument `input_shape`)\n            is required when using this layer as the first layer in a model.\n        input_length: Length of input sequences, to be specified\n            when it is constant.\n            This argument is required if you are going to connect\n            `Flatten` then `Dense` layers upstream\n            (without it, the shape of the dense outputs cannot be computed).\n            Note that if the recurrent layer is not the first layer\n            in your model, you would need to specify the input length\n            at the level of the first layer\n            (e.g. via the `input_shape` argument)\n    \n    # Input shape\n        3D tensor with shape `(batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)`.\n    \n    # Output shape\n        - if `return_state`: a list of tensors. The first tensor is\n            the output. The remaining tensors are the last states,\n            each with shape `(batch_size, units)`.\n        - if `return_sequences`: 3D tensor with shape\n            `(batch_size, timesteps, units)`.\n        - else, 2D tensor with shape `(batch_size, units)`.\n    \n    # Masking\n        This layer supports masking for input data with a variable number\n        of timesteps. To introduce masks to your data,\n        use an [Embedding](embeddings.md) layer with the `mask_zero` parameter\n        set to `True`.\n    \n    # Note on using statefulness in RNNs\n        You can set RNN layers to be 'stateful', which means that the states\n        computed for the samples in one batch will be reused as initial states\n        for the samples in the next batch. This assumes a one-to-one mapping\n        between samples in different successive batches.\n    \n        To enable statefulness:\n            - specify `stateful=True` in the layer constructor.\n            - specify a fixed batch size for your model, by passing\n                if sequential model:\n                  `batch_input_shape=(...)` to the first layer in your model.\n                else for functional model with 1 or more Input layers:\n                  `batch_shape=(...)` to all the first layers in your model.\n                This is the expected shape of your inputs\n                *including the batch size*.\n                It should be a tuple of integers, e.g. `(32, 10, 100)`.\n            - specify `shuffle=False` when calling fit().\n    \n        To reset the states of your model, call `.reset_states()` on either\n        a specific layer, or on your entire model.\n    \n    # Note on specifying the initial state of RNNs\n        You can specify the initial state of RNN layers symbolically by\n        calling them with the keyword argument `initial_state`. The value of\n        `initial_state` should be a tensor or list of tensors representing\n        the initial state of the RNN layer.\n    \n        You can specify the initial state of RNN layers numerically by\n        calling `reset_states` with the keyword argument `states`. The value of\n        `states` should be a numpy array or list of numpy arrays representing\n        the initial state of the RNN layer.\n    \n    # Note on passing external constants to RNNs\n        You can pass \"external\" constants to the cell using the `constants`\n        keyword argument of `RNN.__call__` (as well as `RNN.call`) method. This\n        requires that the `cell.call` method accepts the same keyword argument\n        `constants`. Such constants can be used to condition the cell\n        transformation on additional static inputs (not changing over time),\n        a.k.a. an attention mechanism.\n    \n    # Examples\n    \n    ```python\n        # First, let's define a RNN Cell, as a layer subclass.\n    \n        class MinimalRNNCell(keras.layers.Layer):\n    \n            def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):\n                self.units = units\n                self.state_size = units\n                super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)\n    \n            def build(self, input_shape):\n                self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),\n                                              initializer='uniform',\n                                              name='kernel')\n                self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(\n                    shape=(self.units, self.units),\n                    initializer='uniform',\n                    name='recurrent_kernel')\n                self.built = True\n    \n            def call(self, inputs, states):\n                prev_output = states[0]\n                h = K.dot(inputs, self.kernel)\n                output = h + K.dot(prev_output, self.recurrent_kernel)\n                return output, [output]\n    \n        # Let's use this cell in a RNN layer:\n    \n        cell = MinimalRNNCell(32)\n        x = keras.Input((None, 5))\n        layer = RNN(cell)\n        y = layer(x)\n    \n        # Here's how to use the cell to build a stacked RNN:\n    \n        cells = [MinimalRNNCell(32), MinimalRNNCell(64)]\n        x = keras.Input((None, 5))\n        layer = RNN(cells)\n        y = layer(x)\n    ```\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # ... omitted code ...\n\n\n    # signature of a relative function in this class\n    def states(self):\n        # ... omitted code ...\n        pass\n\n    # signature of a relative function in this class\n    def states(self, states):\n        # ... omitted code ...\n        pass\n\n",
