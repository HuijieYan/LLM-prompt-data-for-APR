The problematic function is `compute_output_shape` within the `RNN` class of the `recurrent.py` file.

The error occurs because the `state_shape` variable is created with incorrect values. Specifically, the length of `state_shape` should be equal to the number of states, which is determined by the length of `self.cell.state_size`. This is not correctly implemented in the original function causing the error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `state_shape` list should be initialized with the correct number of states based on the length of `self.cell.state_size`.

Here's the corrected `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], dim) for dim in self.cell.state_size]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size)]

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

This correction ensures that the `state_shape` list is constructed based on the number of states determined by the length of `self.cell.state_size`.
