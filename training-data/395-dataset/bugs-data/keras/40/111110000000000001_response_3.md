The bug in the `compute_output_shape` method is due to the use of `self.states` as if it were a list, but in the function signature, it is defined twice with different parameters, which is not allowed in Python. Also, the function does not return the computed output shape.

To fix the bug, the function signature needs to be corrected, and the function should return the computed output shape.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        if isinstance(input_shape, list):
            input_shape = input_shape[0]
    
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size
    
        if self.return_sequences:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    
        if self.return_state:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
            return [output_shape] + state_shape
        else:
            return output_shape
```
