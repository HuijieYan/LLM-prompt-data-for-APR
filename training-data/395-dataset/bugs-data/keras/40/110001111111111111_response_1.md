The error message is indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual output shapes at index 3 of the list. The problematic function is `compute_output_shape` within the `RNN` class. The function is supposed to calculate the output shape based on the input shape and the attributes of the RNN layer.

The bug occurs because the `state_shape` calculation is based on the `self.states` attribute, which is not provided as an input to the function. This results in a list of `None` values instead of real states.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to calculate the `state_shape` based on the actual state sizes of the RNN cells. This can be achieved by iterating through the `self.cell.cells` and obtaining their state sizes.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]
    
    if hasattr(self.cell, 'state_size'):
        if isinstance(self.cell.state_size, list):
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size
    else:
        output_dim = None  # Update this as per the actual state_size attribute
    
    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    
    if self.return_state:
        state_shapes = []
        for state_size in self.cell.state_size:
            state_shapes.append((input_shape[0], state_size))
        return [output_shape] + state_shapes
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly calculate the output shape and state shapes, addressing the bug that caused the mismatch in the test case.
