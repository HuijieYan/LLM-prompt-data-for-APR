The issue is occurring in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class. The method is not handling the `self.states` attribute correctly, which leads to incorrect output shapes being returned.

The bug occurs because the implementation of the method is not correctly using the `self.states` attribute to calculate the `state_shape`. It is hardcoded to contain four `None` values, which does not correspond to the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, the method should utilize the `self.states` attribute to determine the `state_shape` dynamically based on the dimensions of the states.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], dim) for dim in self.cell.state_size]
            return [output_shape] + state_shape
        else:
            return [output_shape] + [(input_shape[0], output_dim)]
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected code, we dynamically determine the `state_shape` based on the dimensions of the states. This ensures that the `state_shape` is calculated correctly, and the method now returns the expected output shape based on the test case.
