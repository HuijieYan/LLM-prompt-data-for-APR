The error message indicates that the "assert" statement failed because the actual output shape does not match the expected output shape, specifically at index 3. The expected output shape has "(None, 3)" but the actual output shape has "(None, 6)".

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional statements that determine the output shape based on the input shape and the properties of the cell. There might be an issue with how the output shape is calculated when "return_state" is True and when "return_sequences" is False.

The bug is occurring because the code does not handle the case when "return_state" is True and "return_sequences" is False properly. This leads to the incorrect calculation of the output shape when these conditions are both True.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to correctly calculate the output shape based on the values of "return_sequences" and "return_state". Additionally, we need to ensure that the dimensions are properly aligned in the output shape.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        if self.return_sequences:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        else:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
