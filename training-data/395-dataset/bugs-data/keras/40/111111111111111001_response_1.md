The issue in the `compute_output_shape` function seems to be related to the `state_shape` calculation. It is generating different shapes for the states compared to the expected values in the test.

The bug occurs because the variable `state_shape` is initialized with the existing shape of the states. However, the expected value in the test shows that the `state_shape` should have four entries, each with the shape `(None, 6)`. This means that the `state_shape` calculation is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

To fix the bug, the `state_shape` should be initialized as a list with the same shape for each entry, based on the `output_dim` value. This will ensure that the state shapes are consistent and match the expected values in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
