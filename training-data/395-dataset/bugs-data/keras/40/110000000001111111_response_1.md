The issue in the buggy function is that it incorrectly calculates the `state_shape` when `self.return_state` is True. It calculates the `state_shape` using the input's shape instead of using the output dimension. Additionally, the `self.states` variable is not used to determine the length of the `state_shape` list.

To fix the function, we need to use the `output_dim` to determine the shape of the state and ensure that the `state_shape` list has the same length as `self.states`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]
        
    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this correction, the `state_shape` is now calculated using the `output_dim`, and the `for` loop ensures that the `state_shape` list has the same length as `self.states`.
