The error occurs in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class in the `recurrent.py` file. The error message indicates a mismatch at index 3 of the `output_shape` and `expected_output_shape` lists, specifically for the dimensions (None, 6) and (None, 3).

The potential error location is the conditional statement where it calculates the `output_shape` and `state_shape` based on whether `return_sequences` and `return_state` are true. The issue appears to be with the calculation of `state_shape`.

The bug occurs because the state_shape is being calculated incorrectly. It is not correctly handling the case where `return_sequences` is True and `return_state` is True. As a result, the state_shape for one of the states is being assigned the previous calculated output_dim instead of the correct state size.

To fix the bug, the state_shape needs to be calculated based on the states and their respective dimensions, and then included in the returned output.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    state_shape = []
    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], s) for s in self.cell.state_size]
    return [output_shape] + state_shape if state_shape else output_shape
```

With this correction, the `state_shape` is calculated based on the state sizes of the cell, and it is correctly included along with the `output_shape` as the returned value from the `compute_output_shape` method.
