The test case 'test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape' creates a recurrent neural network (RNN) with two LSTM cells and checks whether the output shape is as expected. The RNN is created with `return_state=True` and `return_sequences=True`.

The error message indicates that the expected output shape does not match the actual output shape. Specifically, at index 3, the expected shape is `(None, 3)` while the actual shape is `(None, 6)`.

The potential error location within the `compute_output_shape` function is the calculation of `state_shape` when `self.return_state` is True. It seems that the calculation is not handling the state size correctly when returning state.

The reason behind the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the state size when returning state. The computation of `state_shape` does not match the expected shape, leading to the mismatch in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the computation of `state_shape` correctly handles the state size and aligns with the expected output shape.
2. Checking the dimensions and shapes of the state to ensure they match the expected output.
3. Verifying that the logic for handling state sizes and shapes is accurate when returning state.

Corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        if isinstance(input_shape, list):
            input_shape = input_shape[0]
    
        output_dim = self.cell.units
    
        if self.return_sequences:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    
        if self.return_state:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.states))]
            return [output_shape] + state_shape
        else:
            return output_shape
```
