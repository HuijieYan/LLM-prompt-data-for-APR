The bug in the `compute_output_shape` function is causing the test case to fail. The `compute_output_shape` function should calculate the output shape of the RNN given the input shape and the configuration of the RNN layer.

The bug occurs when calculating the `state_shape` for the output. The code currently assumes that `self.states` is a list, but it does not take into account the possibility that `self.states` might be a method. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the `state_shape` and results in a mismatch with the expected output shape.

To fix this bug, the calculation of the `state_shape` should be corrected based on the configuration of the RNN layer.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        # Correctly calculate the state_shape based on the configuration
        state_shapes = []
        if isinstance(self.cell.states, list):
            for state_size in self.cell.state_size:
                state_shapes.append((input_shape[0], state_size))
        else:
            state_shapes.append((input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size))

        return [output_shape] + state_shapes
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected code, the state_shape is calculated based on whether `self.cell.states` is a list or not. This ensures that the correct state_shape is calculated and returned, aligning with the expected output shape.
