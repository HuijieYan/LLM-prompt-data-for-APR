Potential error location: 

The issue may be with the `self.states` variable in the `if self.return_state` condition, as `self.states` is not defined in the provided code.

Reason for the bug: 

The variable `self.states` is used in the `if self.return_state` condition, but it is not defined anywhere in the code provided. This would result in a NameError when trying to access it.

Possible approach to fix the bug: 

1. If `self.states` is meant to be a list of states, it should be properly defined and initialized in the class or function that calls `compute_output_shape()`.

2. If `self.states` is not meant to be used here, it should be removed from the condition.

Corrected code:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        return [output_shape]
    else:
        return output_shape
```
