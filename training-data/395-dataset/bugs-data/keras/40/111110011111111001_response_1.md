The problem in the `compute_output_shape` function is that it is incorrectly calculating the `state_shape` when `self.return_state` is True. The issue seems to be with `self.states`, which is a function with two definitions. It seems that the second definition is overriding the first definition, which is causing the input parameter `states` to be overwritten with the second definition.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be modified to correctly calculate the `state_shape` based on the `cell.state_size` and the number of states when `return_state` is True.

Here's the corrected function for the problematic function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size[i]) for i in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this correction, the function should correctly calculate the `state_shape` based on the `cell.state_size` and the number of states when `return_state` is True. This should address the bug and make the function return the expected output.
