Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the section where the output_shape and state_shape are being calculated based on the input_shape and cell state size.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug could be caused by the incorrect calculation of the output_shape and state_shape when the input_shape is a list and when the cell state size is either a single value or a tuple.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the input_shape is a list and extract the actual input_shape from the list if necessary.
2. Handle the cell state size appropriately based on whether it is a single value or a tuple.
3. Calculate the output_shape and state_shape based on the corrected input_shape and cell state size.

Corrected code:
```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if isinstance(self.cell.state_size, int):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
