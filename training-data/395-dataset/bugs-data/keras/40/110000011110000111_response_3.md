The test case `test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape` creates a recurrent neural network (RNN) layer with two LSTM cells, setting `return_state=True` and `return_sequences=True`. The test then calls the `compute_output_shape` method of the RNN layer with a specific input shape and compares the output shape with an expected output shape.

The error message indicates that the output shapes do not match. Specifically, at index 3, the expected shape is `(None, 3)` while the actual output shape is `(None, 6)`. This suggests that there is an issue with the computation of the output shape, leading to an incorrect value at that index.

The bug in the `compute_output_shape` method seems to be related to how the output shape is calculated based on the input shape and the properties of the RNN cells. It appears that the issue arises from the condition where the `self.return_sequences` is `True`, which leads to an incorrect calculation of the output shape.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code within the `compute_output_shape` method to correctly handle the scenario when `return_sequences` is `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.cells]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected code, the condition for `self.return_sequences` is handled correctly, ensuring that the output shape is calculated based on the input shape and the properties of the RNN cells.
