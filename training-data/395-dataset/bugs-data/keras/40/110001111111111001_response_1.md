The bug is likely occurring in the calculation of the `state_shape` variable within the `compute_output_shape` method. The error message from the test function shows that the expected `state_shape` at index 3 is `(None, 3)` but the computed `state_shape` is `(None, 6)`.

The bug occurs because the `state_shape` is directly derived from the `self.states` attribute, which is not being manipulated correctly to produce the expected output. It seems that the length of the `self.states` list is not being handled properly, and it is currently producing a `state_shape` list that contains incorrect values.

To fix this bug:
1. Calculate the output_dim and output_shape as before.
2. Instead of directly deriving `state_shape` from `self.states`, create a list with the correct length and fill it with the appropriate shape.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

By using `range(len(self.states))` to create the `state_shape` list, we ensure that its length matches the expected length, and the correct shape values are generated. This should fix the bug and produce the expected output for the test case.
