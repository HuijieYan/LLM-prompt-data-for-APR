The error occurs in the `compute_output_shape` function, where the output shape is not being computed correctly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output shapes.

The potential error in the code is with the computation of the `state_shape` when `self.return_state` is True. The bug causes the `state_shape` to be incorrectly computed, leading to a mismatch with the expected output shape.

The bug occurs because the `state_shape` is being computed based on `self.states`, but it is not clear where `self.states` is defined or initialized. This could be an oversight, or it may be related to how the `RNN` layer is constructed in the test function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that `self.states` is properly initialized and defined within the `RNN` layer constructor. Additionally, the computation of `state_shape` needs to align with the expected output shape provided in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim)]
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            for state_size in self.cell.state_size:
                state_shape.append((input_shape[0], state_size))
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In the corrected code, the `state_shape` is properly computed based on the `self.cell.state_size` and is concatenated with the `output_shape` when `self.return_state` is True. This should resolve the bug and align the output shape with the expected output in the test function.
