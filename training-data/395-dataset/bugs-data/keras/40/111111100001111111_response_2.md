The bug occurs because the variable `self.states` is being overwritten by a new value. This is seen from the runtime variables, where `self.states` has become `[None, None, None, None]`.

To fix this bug, the `states` function in the RNN class should be renamed. This is because Python does not support method overloading. The second `states` function is overriding the first one, leading to unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
