Potential error: The bug seems to be caused by the use of 'self.states' without a proper definition or reference to this variable in the function.

Reason for bug: The function 'compute_output_shape' is trying to access 'self.states', but this variable has not been defined or referenced anywhere in the function.

Approach to fix the bug: Since we don't have the definition of 'self.states' in the provided code, it is unclear what the intention was. It seems like 'self.states' might be meant to represent the cell states, but without more context, it's hard to provide a definitive fix. However, assuming the intention is to obtain the cell states, we could potentially replace 'self.states' with 'self.cell.states' in the code.

Corrected code:

```python
    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        if isinstance(input_shape, list):
            input_shape = input_shape[0]
    
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
        else:
            output_dim = self.cell.state_size
    
        if self.return_sequences:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
        else:
            output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
    
        if self.return_state:
            if hasattr(self.cell, 'states'):
                state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in self.cell.states]
                return [output_shape] + state_shape
            else:
                return [output_shape]
        else:
            return output_shape
```
