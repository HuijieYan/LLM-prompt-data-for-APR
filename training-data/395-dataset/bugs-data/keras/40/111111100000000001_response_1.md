The potential error location is in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class. The error occurs because there are multiple definitions of the `states` method within the `RNN` class, which is not allowed in Python. The `states` method is defined twice with and without arguments, which causes the conflict.

To fix this bug, the `states` method should be defined only once, and the logic within the `compute_output_shape` method should be corrected.

The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)
        return [output_shape, state_shape]
    else:
        return output_shape
```

The `states` method does not need to be included in the `RNN` class as it is already defined outside the class.
