The buggy function is `compute_output_shape`. The function has various issues, such as accessing `self.states` without it being a proper property of the class, and the state_shape calculation does not align with the given input_shape. Additionally, the input_shape was expected to be a tuple in the given case but was not validated for type. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the state_shape calculation to align properly with the self.states and input_shape. We can also convert the input_shape into a tuple if it's not already in that form. 

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if not isinstance(input_shape, tuple):
        input_shape = tuple(input_shape)

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.cell.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With these changes, the function should work correctly for the given test case and similar scenarios.
