The bug is located in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class in the file "recurrent.py". The bug occurs because the state_shape is being generated using `self.states`, but the `states` method is not correctly implemented to accept and process the states.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `states` method to properly process and update the states. Then, we can generate the state_shape based on the updated states.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

As for the `states` method, it should be modified to properly accept and update the states. Since the initial implementation of `states` method is not provided, it's assumed that the method has a bug that needs fixing. However, I cannot correct it without the actual implementation.

After implementing the correct `states` method, the `compute_output_shape` method should function as expected, generating the correct output_shape and state_shape based on the updated states.
