The bug occurs in the `compute_output_shape` method of the `RNN` class. The issue is with the `state_shape` calculation. The code is not correctly handling the state shape calculation when `self.return_state` is true.

The existing code incorrectly sets the state_shape as a list with a single value repeated for each item in `self.states`, regardless of the number of states. This results in an incorrect state_shape being returned.

To fix the bug, the function should check the length of `self.states` and create a list that repeats `output_shape` for the same number of times as there are states.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` method:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

With this change, the `state_shape` will be calculated based on the length of `self.states`, and the test case `test_stacked_rnn_compute_output_shape` should pass without any assertion errors.
