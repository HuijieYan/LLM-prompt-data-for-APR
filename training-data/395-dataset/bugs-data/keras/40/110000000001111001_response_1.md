The bug in the `compute_output_shape` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `self.states` variable when `self.return_state` is `True`.

The code checks if `self.return_state` is `True`, and then attempts to create `state_shape` based on the `self.states` variable. However, the `self.states` variable is not defined anywhere in the code or provided as an input parameter. This leads to a bug as the `self.states` variable is assumed to be a list of length 4, and this assumption is not valid.

To fix the bug, we can handle the case where `self.return_state` is `True` and initialize `state_shape` based on a default value if `self.states` is not provided. We can also calculate the length of `self.states` and use that to initialize `state_shape`.

Here's the corrected code for the `compute_output_shape` function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size[i]) for i in range(len(self.cell.state_size))]
        else:
            state_shape = [(input_shape[0], self.cell.state_size) for _ in range(len(self.cell.states))]
            
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

This corrected code initializes `state_shape` based on the length of `self.cell.state_size` and uses that to create the `state_shape` list. If `self.cell.state_size` is not a list, it defaults to a single state shape based on the length of `self.cell.states`.
