Potential Error Location:
- The code is trying to handle different input shapes and return sequences, but there are issues with the indexing and handling of `input_shape`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the code is assuming specific shapes and properties of the `input_shape` and `self.cell.state_size`, leading to potential index out of range errors and incorrect output shapes.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Check if the `input_shape` is a list before accessing the elements.
- Validate the `self.cell.state_size` to ensure it has the necessary properties before accessing its elements.

Corrected Code:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0] if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__') else self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
