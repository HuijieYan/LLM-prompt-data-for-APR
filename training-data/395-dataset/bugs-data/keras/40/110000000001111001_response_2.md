The issue with the `compute_output_shape` function is that it is not correctly handling the `self.states` attribute when `self.return_state` is True. 

In the provided input and expected cases, it can be observed that `self.states` is a list with None values. However, the computation of `state_shape` in the original code is not based on the length of `self.states`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the computation of `state_shape` to consider the length of `self.states` and create a list of tuples with `(None, output_dim)` for each state.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

This corrected function now correctly computes the `state_shape` based on the length of `self.states`, as expected in the provided test case.
