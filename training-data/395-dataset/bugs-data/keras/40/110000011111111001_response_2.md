The bug in this function seems to be related to the calculation of the `state_shape` when `self.return_state` is `True`. The error message from the test function indicates that at index 3, the expected shape is `(None, 3)` but the function is returning `(None, 6)`.

The reason behind this bug is that the `state_shape` is being calculated incorrectly. When `self.return_state` is `True`, the `state_shape` should be a list containing the shape `(None, output_dim)` for each state in `self.states`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `state_shape` is calculated correctly based on the output dimensions of each state.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    if self.return_state:
        state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```

In this corrected code, the `state_shape` is calculated using a list comprehension to ensure that the correct shape `(None, output_dim)` is included for each state in `self.states`.

This approach should fix the bug and ensure that the `state_shape` is calculated correctly based on the output dimensions of each state.
