The issue is with the `self.states` attribute. It seems like the buggy function is attempting to access `self.states` as a list, but it's assuming `self.states` is a method. This is causing a TypeError when the function tries to access elements in `self.states`.

To fix this bug:
1. Rename the `states` method to something else that doesn't conflict with the attribute name.
2. Update the access to `self.states` to correctly access the method instead of the attribute.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
    if isinstance(input_shape, list):
        input_shape = input_shape[0]

    if hasattr(self.cell.state_size, '__len__'):
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size[0]
    else:
        output_dim = self.cell.state_size

    if self.return_sequences:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], input_shape[1], output_dim)
    else:
        output_shape = (input_shape[0], output_dim)

    state_shape = [(input_shape[0], output_dim) for _ in range(len(self.states))]
  
    if self.return_state:
        return [output_shape] + state_shape
    else:
        return output_shape
```
