The error occurs at the line `M2 = Model.from_config(config)` in the test function. The specific error message indicates that the `Concatenate` layer requires inputs with matching shapes except for the concatenation axis. The error is likely caused by the order in which layers are processed in the `from_config` method.

The bug occurs because the layers and nodes are not processed in the correct order, leading to the incorrect shape mismatch in the `Concatenate` layer. This is because the `add_unprocessed_node` and `process_node` functions are not adding and processing nodes in the correct order.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to process the nodes in the proper order based on the layer depth. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for how unprocessed nodes are enqueued and dequeued in the `from_config` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    while unprocessed_nodes:
        # Process nodes in order of layer depth
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...
```

By reorganizing the processing of nodes based on layer depth, the bug should be fixed, and the error related to the mismatched shapes in the `Concatenate` layer should be resolved.
