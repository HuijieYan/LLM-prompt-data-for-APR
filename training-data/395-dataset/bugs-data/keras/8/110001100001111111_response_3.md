The bug occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in the Keras `engine/network.py` file. The bug occurs because the input tensors to the shared layer are not processed in the order of the layers in the model config file. This results in the creation of nodes in a non-sequential fashion, leading to incorrect output shapes and causing the model loading to fail.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to reorder the processing of input tensors so that they match the layer order in the model config file. This can be achieved by iterating through the layers in the correct order and processing the nodes accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... existing code ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    # ... remaining code ...
```

With this correction, the nodes will be processed in the correct order, ensuring that the input tensors to shared layers are handled sequentially, preventing any issues with mismatched shapes and ensuring the successful loading of the model.
