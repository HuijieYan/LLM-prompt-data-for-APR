The error occurs in the from_config class method. This method is intended to instantiate a Model from its config, but it has several issues:

1. The add_unprocessed_node, process_node, and process_layer functions are defined inside the from_config method, but they should be defined at the class level.
2. The unpack_singleton function is called inside the process_node function, but it is not defined anywhere.

To fix these issues, the nested functions need to be defined at the class level, and the unpack_singleton function needs to be imported or defined.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_8/keras/engine/network.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def process_node(layer, node_data):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def process_layer(layer_data):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
        """Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).
    
        # Arguments
            config: Model config dictionary.
            custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
                (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
                considered during deserialization.
    
        # Returns

        # Raises

        """
        # Layer instances created during
        # the graph reconstruction process
        created_layers = {}
        
        # Dictionary mapping layer instances to
        # node data that specifies a layer call.
        # It acts as a queue that maintains any unprocessed
        # layer call until it becomes possible to process it
        # (i.e. until the input tensors to the call all exist).
        unprocessed_nodes = {}

# Rest of the code remains the same
```
By defining the nested functions (add_unprocessed_node, process_node, and process_layer) at the class level, we ensure that they can be accessed by the from_config method. This fixes the scope issue and makes the code more organized.
