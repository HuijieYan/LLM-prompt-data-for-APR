The bug occurs in the `from_config` function of the `Network` class in the Keras library. This bug arises when trying to load a model from a config when the model uses a layer shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file.

The error occurs because the `from_config` function attempts to re-enqueue the unprocessed nodes in an incorrect order, leading to the incorrect order of the output nodes of the dense layer.

To fix the bug, the `from_config` function needs to process the nodes in the correct order, ensuring that the inputs are available before attempting to process the nodes. This can be achieved by iterating through the layers and processing the nodes in order of layer depth.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` function:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """
    Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).

    # Arguments
        config: Model config dictionary.
        custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
            (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
            considered during deserialization.

    # Returns
        A model instance.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of improperly formatted config dict.
    """

    # ... existing code ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []
    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        output_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the nodes are processed in order of layer depth, ensuring that the input tensors are available before processing the nodes. This approach resolves the bug by correctly reconstructing the model from its config without mixing up the order of the output nodes.
