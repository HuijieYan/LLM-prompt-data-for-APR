The error seems to be occurring in the `process_node` function within the `from_config` method of the Keras `Network` class. The error message indicates a problem with the input shapes being different for a `Concatenate` layer. This suggests that the input tensors are not being processed in the correct order.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not processing the nodes in the correct order, resulting in mismatched input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the nodes are processed in the correct order. One possible approach to achieve this is to modify the logic for processing nodes to ensure that the input tensors are processed in the correct order before being used in subsequent layers.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # (Existing code...)
    
    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    processed_layers = set()
    while created_layers.keys() != processed_layers:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                if all(inbound_layer in processed_layers for inbound_layer, _, _, _ in unprocessed_nodes[layer]):
                    for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                        process_node(layer, node_data)
                    processed_layers.add(layer)
                    
    # (Existing code...)
```

The above corrected code ensures that the nodes are processed in the correct order based on the layer dependencies, avoiding the issue of mismatched input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer.
