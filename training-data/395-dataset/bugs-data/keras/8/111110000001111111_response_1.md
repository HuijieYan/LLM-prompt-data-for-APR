The bug in the from_config method of the Keras Network class is likely occurring due to the incorrect order of operations when deserializing the layers. The bug is likely happening in the process_node function where the input tensors are being processed without considering their order relative to the layers in the model config file.

To fix the bug, the process_node function should consider the order of the input tensors to ensure that they are processed in the correct sequence. The input tensors need to be processed based on the order of the layers in the model config file to avoid issues with mismatched shapes and incorrect processing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function (process_node and from_config methods):

```python
def process_node(layer, node_data):
    input_tensors = []
    for input_data in node_data:
        inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
        inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
        inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
        if len(input_data) == 3:
            kwargs = {}
        elif len(input_data) == 4:
            kwargs = input_data[3]
        else:
            raise ValueError('Improperly formatted model config.')
        inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
        if len(inbound_layer._inbound_nodes) <= inbound_node_index:
            add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
            return
        inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
        input_tensors.append(
            inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])
    # Call layer on its inputs, thus creating the node
    # and building the layer if needed.
    if input_tensors:
        layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).

    # Arguments
    config: Model config dictionary.
    custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
        (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
        considered during deserialization.

    # Returns
    A model instance.

    # Raises
    ValueError: In case of improperly formatted config dict.
    """
    # Layer instances created during
    # the graph reconstruction process
    created_layers = {}

    # Dictionary mapping layer instances to
    # node data that specifies a layer call.
    # It acts as a queue that maintains any unprocessed
    # layer call until it becomes possible to process it
    # (i.e. until the input tensors to the call all exist).
    unprocessed_nodes = {}

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    # ... (continued code)
```

With the updated process_node and from_config methods, the input tensors are processed in the correct order, ensuring that the layers are deserialized and processed properly based on the model config file. This should resolve the bug in loading a model with shared layers across multiple levels.
