The issue is related to the from_config method of the Keras Network class, particularly in the way it processes the nodes of a layer with shared inputs at different topological depths.

It appears that the bug is occurring when the from_config method processes the nodes in a model that uses a layer shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the correct order according to the layers in the model config file.

The bug is likely related to the order in which the layers are being processed, causing a mismatch in the shape of the inputs to the Concatenate layer.

To fix the bug, the from_config method needs to properly handle layers with shared inputs at multiple depths, ensuring that the order in which the layers are processed aligns with the correct order of the input tensors.

The corrected code for the from_config method is as follows:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth
    # Updated to handle shared layers at different depths
    processed_layers = set()
    pending_layers = list(config['layers'])
    while pending_layers:
        unprocessed = []
        for layer_data in pending_layers:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            inbound_nodes_data = layer_data['inbound_nodes']
            if all((inbound_data['name'] in processed_layers) for node_data in inbound_nodes_data for inbound_data in node_data):
                process_layer(layer_data)
                processed_layers.add(layer_data['name'])
            else:
                unprocessed.append(layer_data)
        if len(unprocessed) == len(pending_layers):
            raise ValueError('Circular dependency in layer topology.')
        pending_layers = unprocessed

    # Generate the model outputs and return the model instance
    # ... (existing code) ...
```

In the corrected code, we use a while loop to iterate through the pending_layers list, checking if the input layers for each layer have already been processed. If they have, we process the layer and add it to the set of processed_layers. If not, we keep the layer in the unprocessed list and continue processing until all layers are handled.

This approach ensures that layers with shared inputs are processed in the correct order, preventing input shape mismatches and resolving the bug.
