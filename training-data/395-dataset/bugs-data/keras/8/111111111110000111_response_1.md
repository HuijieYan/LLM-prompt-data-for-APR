The test function `test_layer_sharing_at_heterogeneous_depth_order` is trying to recreate a model using its configuration, and the error occurs when the recreated model is used to predict the output. The error message indicates a problem with the `Concatenate` layer requiring inputs with matching shapes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `process_node` function, specifically the `layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)` line. This line attempts to build the layer using the provided input tensors, but it appears that the input shapes are not correctly matching for the `Concatenate` layer.

The bug occurs because when deserializing the layers and processing the nodes, the input layers might not be available in the correct order, which causes issues with building the model. This results in the `Concatenate` layer receiving input shapes that do not match, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the code for processing the nodes and building the layers needs to be modified to ensure that the input layers are available in the correct order before attempting to build the model.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method in the `Network` class:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (omitted initialization code)

    # First, we create all layers
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in topological order
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
        if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
            for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                process_node(layer, node_data)

    # Extract input and output tensors based on config
    input_tensors = [Input(shape=tensor_shape) for tensor_shape in config['input_shapes']]
    output_tensors = [created_layers[layer_name]._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors[tensor_index]
                      for layer_name, node_index, tensor_index in config['output_layers']]

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=config.get('name'))
```

In the corrected code, we first create all layers and then process the nodes in topological order. This ensures that the input layers are available in the correct order before building the model. The input and output tensors are extracted based on the config, and the model instance is returned after correctly processing the layers and nodes.
