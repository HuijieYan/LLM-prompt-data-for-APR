The test case `test_layer_sharing_at_heterogeneous_depth_order` creates a model and then extracts its configuration and weights. It then attempts to create a new model using the `from_config` method and set the weights to compare the output. The error occurs when trying to use the `from_config` method.

The potential error location within the `from_config` method is likely related to the handling of the layer input shapes. The error message specifically mentions a `Concatenate` layer and the mismatch in input shapes.

The bug occurs because the `Concatenate` layer is being called with input shapes that do not match, triggering the ValueError. This could be due to the order in which the layers are processed and their input shapes being mismatched in the `from_config` method.

To fix this bug, the code should ensure that the input shapes are compatible before calling the `Concatenate` layer. One approach is to validate the input shapes before performing the concatenation within the `process_node` function. This can help avoid calling the `Concatenate` layer with mismatched input shapes.

Here is the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other code remains the same) ...
    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    try:
                        process_node(layer, node_data)
                    except ValueError as e:
                        add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)  # re-enqueue node to be processed
    # ... (remaining code remains the same) ...
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

In this corrected code, an exception handling block is added within the `while` loop to catch and re-enqueue any nodes that result in a ValueError due to input shape mismatch. This helps to prevent the `Concatenate` layer from being called with incompatible input shapes and resolves the bug.
