The bug occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class when the model uses a layer that is shared at multiple depths, and the order of the input tensors to the shared layer is different from the layers in the model config file.

The error message indicates that when trying to deserialize the `Concatenate` layer, Keras attempts to use inputs with mismatched shapes, leading to a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the inputs to the shared layers are processed in the correct order, and we should handle cases where inputs are not available at the time of processing.

The corrected function `from_config`:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    if all(n in created_layers for n, _, _, _ in node_data[0]):
                        process_node(layer, node_data)
                    else:
                        add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
    # Process the rest of the code
    # ...

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, before processing the node, we check if all required layers are already created. If they are not, we add the node to `unprocessed_nodes` and process it later when all required layers are available. This ensures that the inputs are processed in the correct order and that the shared layer is created with the correct inputs.
