The bug occurs in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in Keras. The bug occurs when loading a model from a config if the model uses a layer that is shared at multiple depths, and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file.

The issue arises when Keras attempts to deserialize the layers by following their order in the config. When trying to deserialize a layer, Keras attempts to create the first output, but it may fail if the input layers are not yet available. This causes Keras to requeue the unprocessed nodes, and if the input layers become available in a different order, it may result in an incorrect node order for the layer outputs.

To fix this bug, the `from_config` method needs to be modified to correctly process the nodes and maintain the order of layer outputs. This can be achieved by reordering the processing of layers and nodes to ensure that the inputs to each layer are available before deserialization.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth
    # with inputs available before deserialization
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        processed_layer = False
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                inputs_available = True
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes[layer]:
                    for input_data in node_data:
                        inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
                        inbound_layer = created_layers.get(inbound_layer_name)
                        if not inbound_layer or inbound_layer not in processed_layers:
                            inputs_available = False
                            add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
                            break
                    if inputs_available:
                        process_node(layer, node_data)
                        processed_layer = True
                        break
                if inputs_available:
                    del unprocessed_nodes[layer]
        if not processed_layer:
            raise ValueError('Error processing unprocessed nodes.')

    # ... omitted code ...
