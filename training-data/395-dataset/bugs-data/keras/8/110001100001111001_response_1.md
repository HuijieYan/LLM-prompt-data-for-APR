The bug likely occurs in the `process_node` function, where it tries to access input tensors from an inbound layer, but the `_inbound_nodes` list is empty.

The bug occurs because the layers are not being processed in the correct order or the graph reconstruction process might not be correctly maintaining the processing order. This results in the `process_node` function failing to retrieve input tensors, leading to a ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the topological sort of the layers needs to be ensured so that layers are processed in the correct order. Also, the graph reconstruction process should properly maintain any unprocessed layer calls until it becomes possible to process them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # Existing code

    # New code for topological sort
    from collections import deque

    # Dictionary containing layers with no dependencies
    independent_layers = {}
    
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        layer_name = layer_data['name']
        inbound_nodes_data = layer_data['inbound_nodes']
        layer_dependencies = set()
        for node_data in inbound_nodes_data:
            for inp in node_data:
                layer_dependencies.add(inp[0])  # Add the dependent layer names
        
        if not layer_dependencies:  # No dependencies
            independent_layers[layer_name] = layer_data

    processed = set()
    topological_order = []

    # Perform topological sort
    while independent_layers:
        layer_name, layer_data = independent_layers.popitem()
        topological_order.append(layer_data)
        processed.add(layer_name)

        for next_layer_data in config['layers']:
            next_layer_name = next_layer_data['name']
            if next_layer_name not in processed:  # Process the next layer only if it hasn't been processed
                inbound_nodes_data = next_layer_data['inbound_nodes']
                for node_data in inbound_nodes_data:
                    for inp in node_data:
                        if inp[0] == layer_name:  # Remove the dependency
                            inp[0] = None

                in_dependencies = any(
                    inp[0] is not None and inp[0] in processed for node_data in inbound_nodes_data for inp in node_data)
                if not in_dependencies:  # No dependencies, add to independent_layers
                    independent_layers[next_layer_name] = next_layer_data

    # Rest of the existing code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, a topological sort is performed using a dictionary to track layers with no dependencies. The topological sort ensures that layers are processed in the correct order, addressing the bug in the original function.
