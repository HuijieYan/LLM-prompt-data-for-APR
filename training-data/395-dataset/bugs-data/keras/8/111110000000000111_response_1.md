The error occurs when trying to load a model from a config that uses a layer shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `from_config` method of the `Network` class, specifically in the `process_node` function. The error occurs when processing nodes in order of layer depth and trying to create the first output of a layer when the input layers are not yet available. This re-enqueues the nodes and creates them in the incorrect order, leading to mismatched shapes.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input tensors to a shared layer are created and processed in the correct order to avoid mismatched shapes.

Here is the corrected code for the `from_config` method of the `Network` class:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    # this function processes nodes and their inputs
    def process_nodes(nodes):
        for node_data in nodes:
            layer_name = node_data[0]
            inbound_node_index = node_data[1]
            inbound_tensor_index = node_data[2]
            kwargs = node_data[3] if len(node_data) == 4 else {}
            inbound_layer = created_layers[layer_name]
            inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
            input_tensors = inbound_node.output_tensors
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_nodes(created_layers[layer_data['name']]['inbound_nodes'])

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []

    # Gather layer inputs and outputs
    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        output_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
``` 
In the corrected code, the function `process_nodes` is added to process the nodes in the correct order of layer depth. This ensures that the inputs to shared layers are created and processed before the layers that depend on them. This should fix the issue of mismatched shapes when creating the model from its config.
