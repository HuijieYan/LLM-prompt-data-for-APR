The bug occurs when loading a model from a configuration file in Keras, specifically when the model uses a layer that is shared at multiple depths and the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file.

The error message states that a `Concatenate` layer requires inputs with matching shapes except for the concatenate axis. It indicates that the inputs shapes are [(None, 12), (None, 1, 12)], which do not match, resulting in the ValueError.

The issue is with the from_config method in the Network class in the file keras/engine/network.py under the keras package.

To fix the bug, the process_node and process_layer functions need to be modified to ensure that the input tensors are processed in an order that matches the layer dependencies. This can be achieved by restructuring the logic for processing the layers and nodes in the from_config method.

Here is the corrected code for the from_config method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).

    # Arguments
        config: Model config dictionary.
        custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
            (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
            considered during deserialization.

    # Returns
        A model instance.

    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of improperly formatted config dict.
    """

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []
    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        output_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    
    # Create a dictionary to keep track of processed layers and nodes
    processed_layers = {}
    processed_nodes = []

    # Loop through the layers to process the nodes in the correct order of dependencies
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        layer_name = layer_data['name']
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]

        # Process the layer only if all its inbound nodes have been processed
        if all(n in processed_nodes for n in layer_data['inbound_nodes']):
            process_layer(layer_data)
            processed_layers[layer_name] = layer
            for node_data in layer_data['inbound_nodes']:
                processed_nodes.append(node_data)
    
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

The changes made in the corrected code involve keeping track of the processed layers and nodes to ensure that they are processed in the correct order of dependencies. This should address the issue of loading a model with shared layers across multiple levels and when the input tensors to the shared layer are not in the order of the layers in the model config file.
