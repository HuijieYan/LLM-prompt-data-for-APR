The bug in the given function seems to be related to the processing of nodes and layers. It appears that the `process_node` function is not being called properly, causing the `input_tensors` list to remain empty when it should be populated with tensors from the inbound nodes.

The reasons for this bug might be:
1. Incorrect handling of inbound nodes and tensors.
2. Failure to properly process and call the layers on their inputs.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `process_node` function is being called correctly and that the `input_tensors` list is populated with the appropriate tensors before calling the layer.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data):
        if layer not in unprocessed_nodes:
            unprocessed_nodes[layer] = [node_data]
        else:
            unprocessed_nodes[layer].append(node_data)

    def process_node(layer, node_data):
        input_tensors = []
        for input_data in node_data:
            inbound_layer_name = input_data[0]
            inbound_node_index = input_data[1]
            inbound_tensor_index = input_data[2]
            if len(input_data) == 3:
                kwargs = {}
            elif len(input_data) == 4:
                kwargs = input_data[3]
            else:
                raise ValueError('Improperly formatted model config.')
            inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
            if len(inbound_layer._inbound_nodes) <= inbound_node_index:
                add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
                return
            inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
            input_tensors.append(
                inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])
        # Call layer on its inputs, thus creating the node
        # and building the layer if needed.
        if input_tensors:
            layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)

    def process_layer(layer_data):
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer in list(unprocessed_nodes):
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []

    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        # ... (code for input_tensors remains unchanged)

    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        # ... (code for output_tensors remains unchanged)

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, I've made sure that the `process_node` function is called within the `while unprocessed_nodes` loop, and that the `input_tensors` list is populated with the appropriate tensors before calling the layer function.
