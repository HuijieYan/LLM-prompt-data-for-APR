The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of unprocessed nodes in the while loop. The error may be due to the nested loop structure and the handling of unprocessed nodes within the while loop.

The bug occurs because the unprocessed_nodes dictionary is not being handled correctly within the while loop. The nested loop structure could lead to the incorrect processing of nodes.

To fix this bug, we can modify the processing of unprocessed nodes within the while loop. We should iterate over the unprocessed_nodes and process each node before checking for more unprocessed nodes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other parts of the code unchanged)

    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        keys = list(unprocessed_nodes.keys())
        for layer in keys:
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                node_data_list = unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer)
                for node_data in node_data_list:
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    # ... (other parts of the code unchanged)
```

By iterating over the keys of unprocessed_nodes and then processing each node, we ensure that all nodes are correctly processed. This approach avoids potential issues with the nested loop structure and the handling of unprocessed nodes within the while loop.
