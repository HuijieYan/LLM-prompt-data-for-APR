The error occurs when the `Model.from_config` method is called in the test case. The function `from_config` is responsible for deserializing a model and instantiating it based on the provided config. The error message indicates a shape mismatch during the concatenation operation, which is a result of incorrect input shapes being passed to the `Concatenate` layer within the `from_config` function.

The bug is likely within the `from_config` function, specifically when processing the node data to create the layer and building the input tensors for each layer. This leads to a shape mismatch when the layers are called on their inputs.

The reason behind this bug is the improper handling of input shapes and node data during the deserialization process. The processing of node data and input tensors needs to be revised to ensure that the proper input shapes are used when calling each layer.

To fix the bug, the `from_config` function should be updated to correctly process the input shapes and node data, ensuring that the input tensors are created with the appropriate shapes for each layer. Additionally, the error handling for shape mismatches should be improved to provide more informative and accurate error messages.

Below is the corrected implementation of the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []
    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        output_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

With this correction, the `from_config` method should appropriately handle the deserialization of the model and ensure that the input and output tensors have the correct shapes, resolving the shape mismatch issue encountered in the test case.
