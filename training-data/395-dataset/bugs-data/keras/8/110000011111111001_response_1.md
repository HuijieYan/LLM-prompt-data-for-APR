The error occurs when the `from_config` method is being called to create a model from the config obtained from another model. The error message indicates a problem in the `Concatenate` layer's shapes not matching. This problem may occur due to the misalignment of shapes during the reconstruction of the model from its config.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `process_node` function where the layer is being called.

The bug occurs because the process of reconstructing the model from its config does not appropriately handle the input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer. When processing the nodes, the input shapes of the layers are not aligned correctly, leading to the mismatch in shapes.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the process of reconstructing the model from its config to ensure that the input shapes are appropriately aligned before the `Concatenate` layer is called. Additionally, handling the input shapes for each layer during the reconstruction process can help avoid shape mismatch errors when reconstructing the model.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # Initialize empty list to store layer instances.
    created_layers = {}

    # Dictionary to maintain unprocessed layer nodes.
    unprocessed_nodes = {}

    def process_node(layer, node_data):
        input_tensors = []
        input_shapes = []
        for input_data in node_data:
            inbound_layer_name, inbound_node_index, inbound_tensor_index, kwargs = input_data
            inbound_layer = created_layers[inbound_layer_name]
            inbound_node = inbound_layer._inbound_nodes[inbound_node_index]
            input_tensors.append(inbound_node.output_tensors[inbound_tensor_index])
            input_shapes.append(inbound_node.output_shapes[inbound_tensor_index])
        # Call layer on its inputs, thus creating the node.
        if input_tensors:
            layer(unpack_singleton(input_tensors), **kwargs)
    
    def process_layer(layer_data):
        # Deserializes a layer, then call it on appropriate inputs.
        layer_name = layer_data['name']
        layer = deserialize_layer(layer_data, custom_objects=custom_objects)
        created_layers[layer_name] = layer
        inbound_nodes_data = layer_data['inbound_nodes']
        for node_data in inbound_nodes_data:
            add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)

    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
        
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    process_node(layer, node_data)
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By modifying the `from_config` method as suggested, the bug related to the mismatch of input shapes in the `Concatenate` layer should be resolved. However, additional testing may be necessary to ensure that the fix resolves the issue without introducing new bugs.
