The test case is attempting to create a model with layers that share depth at heterogeneous orders. When converting the model configuration to a new model using the `Model.from_config(config)` method, it fails and raises a `ValueError` related to a `Concatenate` layer. The error occurs because the `Concatenate` layer requires inputs with matching shapes except for the concatenation axis, and in this case, the shapes do not match due to the use of reshape layers in the original model.

The potential error in the `from_config` method might be related to how the layers and their connections are processed during deserialization. The process seems to build the model from the given configuration but encounters issues when handling layers with mismatched input shapes.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `from_config` method to handle the input shapes for the `Concatenate` layer correctly. This might involve adjusting the logic for processing nodes and ensuring that the input shapes are properly validated before creating the model instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # Existing method's logic...

    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []

    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])

    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        output_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])

    # Account for shape mismatches by using Concatenate layer with axis as 1
    from keras.layers import Concatenate
    concatenated = Concatenate(axis=1)(input_tensors)

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=concatenated, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the inputs are concatenated with the `Concatenate` layer, and the output is defined based on the concatenated result and added to the model instance. This approach aims to handle the mismatched input shapes that caused the `ValueError` during deserialization.
