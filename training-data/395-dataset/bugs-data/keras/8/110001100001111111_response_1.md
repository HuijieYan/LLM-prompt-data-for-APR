The error is likely occurring in the `process_node` function within the `from_config` method of the `Network` class in Keras. The bug seems to be related to the order in which the layers are instantiated and applied when loading a model from a config.

The bug occurs because Keras attempts to create the first output of a layer without ensuring that the necessary input layers are available. This causes the order of the output nodes to become swapped, ultimately leading to incorrect shapes and an error when later layers are processed.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the input layers are available before attempting to create the outputs for a layer. This can be achieved by reorganizing the logic in the `process_node` function to handle the layer nodes in the correct order based on their dependencies.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `from_config` method, with the suggested fix included:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    while unprocessed_nodes:
        processed_something = False
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    if all(l in created_layers for l in node_data[0]):
                        process_node(layer, node_data)
                        processed_something = True
                    else:
                        add_unprocessed_node(layer, node_data)
        if not processed_something:
            raise ValueError('Unprocessable nodes exist: ' + str(unprocessed_nodes))

    # ... (the rest of the method remains unchanged) ...
```

In this correction, a check is added to ensure that all necessary input layers are already created before processing the node. If not, the node is re-enqueued to be processed later. This ensures that the input layers are available when creating the outputs, preventing the swapping of output order and the resulting error.
