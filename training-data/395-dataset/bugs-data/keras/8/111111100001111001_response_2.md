One potential error in the `from_config` method is that the input tensors are not being processed correctly, resulting in the `input_tensors` list being empty. This is likely due to the ordering of the layers and the nodes not being processed in the correct order, which leads to the input tensors not being available when needed.

To fix this issue, the processing of layers and nodes needs to ensure that input tensors are available before they are used. This can be achieved by reordering the processing logic and ensuring that all input tensors are processed before they are used in the `process_node` function.

Below is the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    # Process nodes in order of layer depth
    # Process layers first
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)

    # Then process nodes
    processed_layers = set()
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        layer_name = layer_data['name']
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        if layer not in processed_layers:
            for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.get(layer, []):
                process_node(layer, node_data)
            processed_layers.add(layer)

    # Use input and output tensors to instantiate the model
    input_tensors = [created_layers[layer_name]._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors[tensor_index]
                     for layer_name, node_index, tensor_index in config['input_layers']]
    output_tensors = [created_layers[layer_name]._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors[tensor_index]
                      for layer_name, node_index, tensor_index in config['output_layers']]

    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=config.get('name'))
```

In the corrected code, the layers are processed first, and then the nodes are processed in order to ensure that all necessary input tensors are available before they are used. Additionally, a set `processed_layers` is used to keep track of which layers have been processed to prevent redundant processing.
