The error seems to occur when the model is being loaded from its config using the `from_config` method. The error message indicates that the `Concatenate` layer requires inputs with matching shapes except for the concat axis, but it is receiving inputs with different shapes. The issue is related to the order of the layers when the model is being reconstructed.

The bug occurs because during deserialization of the layers in the `from_config` method, the input tensors are not available in the correct order. This causes the shape mismatch in the `Concatenate` layer.

To fix the bug, the `unprocessed_nodes` dictionary should be maintained in such a way that the layers are processed in the correct order. This will ensure that the inputs to each layer are available before the layer is processed.

Additionally, the logic for processing unprocessed nodes needs to be adjusted to ensure that the nodes are processed in the order of layer depth.

Below is the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # Initialize a dictionary to store the depth of each layer
    layer_depth = {}
    
    # Initialize a queue to maintain the order of layer processing
    layer_queue = []

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    
        # Compute the depth of each layer based on inbound nodes
        layer_depth[layer_data['name']] = compute_layer_depth(layer_data, layer_depth)
    
    # Enqueue layers in the order of layer depth
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        layer_queue.append((layer_data['name'], layer_depth[layer_data['name']]))
    
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth
    while layer_queue:
        layer_queue.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort layers by depth
        layer_name, _ = layer_queue.pop(0)  # Pop the layer with the minimum depth
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        
        # Process the layer
        if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
            for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                process_node(layer, node_data)

    name = config.get('name')
    input_tensors = []
    output_tensors = []
    for layer_data in config['input_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        input_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    for layer_data in config['output_layers']:
        layer_name, node_index, tensor_index = layer_data
        assert layer_name in created_layers
        layer = created_layers[layer_name]
        layer_output_tensors = layer._inbound_nodes[node_index].output_tensors
        output_tensors.append(layer_output_tensors[tensor_index])
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

Here, the `compute_layer_depth` function is used to calculate the depth of each layer based on inbound nodes. This ensures that the layers are enqueued for processing in the correct order. Additionally, the `layer_queue` maintains the order of layer processing based on depth.

The corrected code addresses the bug by ensuring that the layers are processed in the correct order, allowing the input tensors to be available in the required order for the `Concatenate` layer, thus resolving the shape mismatch issue.
