The test case provided indicates that after the deserialization process, the order of the input tensors is not maintained, leading to a Value error when a Concatenate layer is encountered. This suggests that the issue is likely in the deserialization process, specifically in the processing of nodes and layer inputs.

The bug occurs because the order in which the shared layers are applied affects the order of the input tensors during deserialization, leading to conflicting shapes for the input tensors, which causes the Concatenate layer to fail.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the deserialization process to explicitly maintain the order of input tensors based on the original layer connections. This may involve reordering the creation and processing of layers and nodes to ensure that input tensors are processed in the correct order.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """
    Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).

    Arguments:
        config: Model config dictionary.
        custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
            (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
            considered during deserialization.

    Returns:
        A model instance.

    Raises:
        ValueError: In case of improperly formatted config dict.
    """
    # ... existing code ...

    # First, we create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    
    processed_nodes = set()
    # Then we process nodes in order of layer depth.
    # Nodes that cannot yet be processed (if the inbound node
    # does not yet exist) are re-enqueued, and the process
    # is repeated until all nodes are processed.
    while unprocessed_nodes:
        for layer_data in config['layers']:
            layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
            if layer in unprocessed_nodes:
                for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                    if all(layer_data in processed_nodes for layer_data in node_data):
                        continue
                    process_node(layer, node_data)
                    processed_nodes.add(node_data[0])

    # ... existing code ...
```

The corrected code aims to maintain and prioritize the correct order of processing input tensors based on the original layer connections, ensuring that they are processed in a way that avoids conflicting shapes during deserialization.
