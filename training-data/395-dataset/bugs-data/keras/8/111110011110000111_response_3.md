The error occurs when using the `Model.from_config(config)` method, specifically when deserializing and processing the layers. The error is triggered at the `Concatenate` layer, indicating that there is a mismatch in the input shapes that it receives.

The bug occurs due to the ordering and processing of the nodes in the model config when the layers have shared inputs at different depths. This causes the model loading process to process the layers in an incorrect order, leading to shape mismatches.

To fix the bug, the processing of the nodes and layers from the model config should be adjusted to ensure that the layers with shared inputs at different depths are correctly processed in the right order, thus avoiding shape mismatches.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_config` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    """Instantiates a Model from its config (output of `get_config()`).
    
    # Arguments
        config: Model config dictionary.
        custom_objects: Optional dictionary mapping names
            (strings) to custom classes or functions to be
            considered during deserialization.
    
    # Returns
        A model instance.
    
    # Raises
        ValueError: In case of improperly formatted config dict.
    """
    # Define the processing logic for nodes and layers
    # ... (omitted for brevity) ...

    # First, create all layers and enqueue nodes to be processed
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        process_layer(layer_data)
    
    # Then process nodes in the correct order
    for layer_data in config['layers']:
        layer = created_layers[layer_data['name']]
        while layer in unprocessed_nodes:
            for node_data in unprocessed_nodes.pop(layer):
                process_node(layer, node_data)

    # Retrieve the model's name, input tensors, and output tensors
    # ... (omitted for brevity) ...

    # Finally, return the model instance
    return cls(inputs=input_tensors, outputs=output_tensors, name=name)
```

By adjusting the order in which the nodes and layers are processed, the correct inputs will be available when needed, thereby avoiding shape mismatches.
