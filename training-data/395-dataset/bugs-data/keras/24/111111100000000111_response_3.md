The potential error in this code is the nested `is_indexed_slices` function within the `set_model` method of the `TensorBoard` class. The error occurs because the `is_indexed_slices` function is defined within the `set_model` method, but it should be defined outside of the method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the nested `is_indexed_slices` function is not accessible outside the `set_model` method, which makes it impossible to use it in other parts of the class.

To fix the bug, the `is_indexed_slices` function should be defined outside the `set_model` method so that it can be used throughout the class.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class TensorBoard(Callback):
    # ... previous code ...

    def is_indexed_slices(self, grad):
        return type(grad).__name__ == 'IndexedSlices'

    def set_model(self, model):
        # ... previous code ...
        if self.write_grads:
            grads = model.optimizer.get_gradients(model.total_loss, weight)

            grads = [grad.values if self.is_indexed_slices(grad) else grad for grad in grads]
            tf.summary.histogram('{}_grad'.format(mapped_weight_name), grads)
        # ... remaining code ...
```
