The error seems to occur in the `set_model` method of the `TensorBoard` class. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect naming of the tensor summaries and the usage of the `tf.summary.histogram` and `tf.summary.image` functions.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the function is trying to create tensor summaries for visualization in TensorFlow's TensorBoard. The function traverses the layers of the model, creates histograms for weights and gradients, and sets up tensor summaries for visualization.

The potential error location seems to be in the `set_model` method, specifically in the logic related to creating tensor summaries using `tf.summary.histogram` and `tf.summary.image`.

The reason behind the bug could be that the code is not using the correct identifiers and naming conventions when creating tensor summaries. Additionally, there might be issues with the handling of the metadata for the embeddings, as indicated by the presence of an empty string `''` as the `metadata_path`.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the naming of tensor summaries is consistent and follows the proper conventions. Additionally, you need to handle the embedding metadata correctly. From the given input values and expected values, it seems that the original code is not generating the expected tensor summaries and metadata.

Here's the corrected version of the `set_model` method:

```python
def set_model(self, model):
    self.model = model
    if K.backend() == 'tensorflow':
        self.sess = K.get_session()
    if self.histogram_freq and self.merged is None:
        for layer in self.model.layers:
            for weight in layer.weights:
                mapped_weight_name = weight.name.replace(':', '_')
                tf.summary.histogram(mapped_weight_name, weight)
                if self.write_grads:
                    grads = model.optimizer.get_gradients(model.total_loss, weight)
                    tf.summary.histogram('{}_grad'.format(mapped_weight_name), grads)
                if self.write_images:
                    w_img = tf.expand_dims(tf.expand_dims(weight, 0), -1)
                    tf.summary.image(mapped_weight_name, w_img)

            if hasattr(layer, 'output'):
                tf.summary.histogram('{}_out'.format(layer.name), layer.output)
    self.merged = tf.summary.merge_all()

    if self.write_graph:
        self.writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(self.log_dir, self.sess.graph)
    else:
        self.writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(self.log_dir)

    if self.embeddings_freq and hasattr(model, 'embedding_metadata'):
        projector.visualize_embeddings(self.writer, model.embedding_metadata)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by ensuring proper naming and handling of tensor summaries, as well as addressing the embedding metadata properly based on the expected values.
