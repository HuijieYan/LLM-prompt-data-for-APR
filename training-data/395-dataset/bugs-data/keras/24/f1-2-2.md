TensorBoard basic visualizations.

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard)
is a visualization tool provided with TensorFlow.

This callback writes a log for TensorBoard, which allows
you to visualize dynamic graphs of your training and test
metrics, as well as activation histograms for the different
layers in your model.

If you have installed TensorFlow with pip, you should be able
to launch TensorBoard from the command line:
```sh
tensorboard --logdir=/full_path_to_your_logs
```

When using a backend other than TensorFlow, TensorBoard will still work
(if you have TensorFlow installed), but the only feature available will
be the display of the losses and metrics plots.

# Arguments
    log_dir: the path of the directory where to save the log
        files to be parsed by TensorBoard.
    histogram_freq: frequency (in epochs) at which to compute activation
        and weight histograms for the layers of the model. If set to 0,
        histograms won't be computed. Validation data (or split) must be
        specified for histogram visualizations.
    write_graph: whether to visualize the graph in TensorBoard.
        The log file can become quite large when
        write_graph is set to True.
    write_grads: whether to visualize gradient histograms in TensorBoard.
        `histogram_freq` must be greater than 0.
    batch_size: size of batch of inputs to feed to the network
        for histograms computation.
    write_images: whether to write model weights to visualize as
        image in TensorBoard.
    embeddings_freq: frequency (in epochs) at which selected embedding
        layers will be saved.
    embeddings_layer_names: a list of names of layers to keep eye on. If
        None or empty list all the embedding layer will be watched.
    embeddings_metadata: a dictionary which maps layer name to a file name
        in which metadata for this embedding layer is saved. See the
        [details](https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/embedding_viz/#metadata_optional)
        about metadata files format. In case if the same metadata file is
        used for all embedding layers, string can be passed.
