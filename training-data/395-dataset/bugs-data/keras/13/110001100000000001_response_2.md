Error: The "fit_generator" function is missing a return statement, causing it to return "None" instead of the model's training history.

Reason: The function is missing a "return" statement at the end, so it doesn't return the training history of the model.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use the "model.history" variable to store the training history of the model.
2. Add a "return" statement at the end of the function to return the "model.history" variable.

Corrected code:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    # ... (previous code) ...

    callbacks.on_train_end()
    return model.history
```
