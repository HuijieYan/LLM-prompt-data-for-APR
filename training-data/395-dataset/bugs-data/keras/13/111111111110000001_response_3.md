The error occurs when the `fit_generator` function attempts to run with `steps=None` for a generator that is not based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class. The error message clearly indicates that `steps=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class, and it prompts the user to specify `steps` or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

The problem is that the function does not handle the case where `steps` is not provided and the generator is not based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `fit_generator` function needs to include a check for the case where `steps` is not specified and the generator is not based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class. In this case, the function can calculate the length of the generator and use that as the `steps`.

Here's the corrected version of the `fit_generator` function to address the issue:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  # ... other parameters ...
                  initial_epoch=0):
    # ... existing code ...

    if steps_per_epoch is None:
        if not isinstance(generator, Sequence):
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a'
                             ' generator based on the '
                             '`keras.utils.Sequence`'
                             ' class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` '
                             'or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')

    # ... rest of the code ...
    return model.history
```

In this corrected implementation, if `steps_per_epoch` is not specified and the generator is not based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class, the function calculates the length of the generator and uses that as the `steps_per_epoch`. This addresses the issue raised in the error message.
