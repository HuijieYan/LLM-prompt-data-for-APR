The bug occurred due to a conditional check for `Sequence` incorrectly assigned `val_enqueuer_gen` without specifying `validation_steps`. 

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the conditional check for `val_data` to ensure that `validation_steps` is set if `val_data` is an instance of `Sequence`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    
    # ... (existing code for model training) ...

    if isinstance(val_data, Sequence):
        val_enqueuer_gen = iter(val_data)
        validation_steps = len(val_data)

    # ... (remaining code for model training) ...
```

With this modification, the bug causing the incorrect conditional check for `val_data` should be resolved.
