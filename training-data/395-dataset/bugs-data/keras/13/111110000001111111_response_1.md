The bug occurs in the `fit_generator` function when using the `evaluate_generator` method with workers=0 and subclasses of `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence` for both training and validation data. The issue arises because the API of the Sequence is not recognized inside `evaluate_generator`. This results in a ValueError: `steps=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class. Please specify `steps` or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

The reason behind this bug is that the `evaluate_generator` method is not handling the case where the validation data is an instance of `Sequence` properly when workers=0. As a result, the validation steps are not being calculated correctly for the Sequence class.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to explicitly check if the validation data is an instance of `Sequence` and set `validation_steps` accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic `fit_generator` function is as follows:

```python
from keras.utils.data_utils import Sequence

def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    val_gen = isinstance(validation_data, Sequence)
    if val_gen and workers == 0:
        if isinstance(validation_data, Sequence):
            val_enqueuer_gen = iter(validation_data)
            validation_steps = len(validation_data)

    # ... (rest of the function)
```

In this correction, a check is added to explicitly handle the case when the validation data is an instance of `Sequence` and workers=0. This ensures that `validation_steps` are set properly for the Sequence class, resolving the bug.
