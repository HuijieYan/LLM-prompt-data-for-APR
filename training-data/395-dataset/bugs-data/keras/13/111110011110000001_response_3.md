The error occurs in the `fit_generator` method of the Keras library. The error message indicates that the `fit_generator` method is trying to use a generator without specifying the number of steps, which is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class. 

The potential error location is in the logic that handles the determination of the number of steps when using a generator.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `fit_generator` method does not handle the case when the number of steps is unspecified for a regular generator (not based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class).

To fix the bug, the `fit_generator` method should be modified to handle the case when the number of steps is unspecified for a regular generator.

Below is the corrected code for the `fit_generator` method:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    wait_time = 0.01  # in seconds
    epoch = initial_epoch

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    if steps_per_epoch is None:
        if isinstance(generator, Sequence):
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a'
                             ' generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence`'
                             ' class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` or use'
                             ' the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the function checks if the `generator` is an instance of `keras.utils.Sequence` and uses the length of the generator if `steps_per_epoch` is unspecified. Otherwise, it raises a `ValueError` describing the requirement for an explicit `steps_per_epoch` for generators not based on the `Sequence` class.
