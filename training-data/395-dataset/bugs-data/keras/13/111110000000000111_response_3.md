In the provided bug report, the issue arises when using the `fit_generator` method with `workers=0` and subclassing `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence` for both training and validation data. The error message indicates a problem with the `steps` parameter not being specified for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

The potential error location within the function is in the validation steps setup for the generator.

The bug occurs because when using a subclass of `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence` for validation data, the function fails to recognize the API of the Sequence. As a result, it raises a ValueError indicating that `steps=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

To fix the bug, we can modify the way the validation steps are handled for the generator, specifically when using a subclass of `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence`. We need to ensure that the `validation_steps` parameter is set appropriately based on the length of the validation data if it is an instance of `Sequence`.

Here's the corrected code for the `fit_generator` method:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    wait_time = 0.01  # in seconds
    epoch = initial_epoch

    # existing code remains unchanged

    if steps_per_epoch is None:
        if isinstance(generator, Sequence):
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a'
                             ' generator based on the '
                             '`keras.utils.Sequence`'
                             ' class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` '
                             'or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')

    # existing code remains unchanged

    # additional code to handle validation steps for Sequence
    if isinstance(validation_data, Sequence) and not validation_steps:
        validation_steps = len(validation_data)

    # existing code remains unchanged

    return model.history
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added to set the `validation_steps` based on the length of the validation data if it is an instance of `Sequence`. This adjustment ensures that the `validation_steps` parameter is appropriately handled for Sequence-based validation data, addressing the bug described in the issue.
