The error occurs because the `fit_generator` function is not recognizing the `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence` API when `workers` is set to 0. This leads to a ValueError in the `evaluate_generator` function due to an incorrect check for `None` steps.

To resolve this issue, the check for `None` steps needs to take into account the sequence type of the data and handle it appropriately.

The corrected code for the `fit_generator` function is as follows:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  verbose=1,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    
    if steps_per_epoch is None:
        if isinstance(generator, Sequence):
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a'
                             ' generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence`'
                             ' class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` or use the'
                             ' `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

```

By adding this condition to handle `None` steps based on the type of the generator, we can ensure that the `fit_generator` function correctly works with `keras.utils.data_utils.Sequence` even when `workers` is set to 0.
