The error occurs in the `fit_generator` function because the `evaluate_generator` function does not recognize the API of the `Sequence` class, leading to a `ValueError` stating that `steps=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `evaluate_generator` recognizes the API of the `Sequence` class and handles it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `fit_generator` function:

```python
def fit_generator(model, generator, steps_per_epoch=None, epochs=1, verbose=1, callbacks=None, validation_data=None, validation_steps=None, class_weight=None, max_queue_size=10, workers=1, use_multiprocessing=False, shuffle=True, initial_epoch=0):
    # ... omitted code ...

    if steps_per_epoch is None:
        if isinstance(generator, Sequence):
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    return model.history
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that if `steps_per_epoch` is None, it is only calculated based on the length of the generator if it is an instance of the `Sequence` class. Otherwise, a `ValueError` is raised to specify that it should be calculated or the `Sequence` class should be used.

This fix ensures that the `fit_generator` function handles the `Sequence` class correctly, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
