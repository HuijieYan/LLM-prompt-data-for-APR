The test case `test_model_methods` is testing various methods of the `Model` class, including `fit`, `train_on_batch`, `evaluate`, `predict`, and `fit_generator`. The error occurs in the `fit_generator` method.

The error message indicates that the `fit_generator` method is raising a `ValueError` due to `steps=None` not being valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class. This means that when `steps` is not provided explicitly, as is the case in this test, it should default to the length of the sequence.

The potential error location is within the `fit_generator` method of the `keras/engine/training_generator.py` file, specifically in the block of code where the `steps` parameter is validated.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `fit_generator` method does not handle the case where `steps` is not provided explicitly and should default to the length of the sequence.

To fix the bug, the `fit_generator` method should be modified to handle the default behavior when `steps` is not provided explicitly.

Here's the corrected code for the `fit_generator` method:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    if steps_per_epoch is None:
        if isinstance(generator, Sequence):
            steps_per_epoch = len(generator)
        else:
            raise ValueError('`steps_per_epoch=None` is only valid for a'
                             ' generator based on the '
                             '`keras.utils.Sequence`'
                             ' class. Please specify `steps_per_epoch` '
                             'or use the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.')

    # the rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the condition to handle `steps=None` has been added explicitly. If `steps_per_epoch` is not provided, it defaults to the length of the generator when the generator is based on `keras.utils.Sequence` class. Otherwise, it raises a ValueError as originally implemented. This should address the issue raised in the error message.
