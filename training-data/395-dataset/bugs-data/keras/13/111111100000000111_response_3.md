The error occurs in the function `fit_generator` in the file `training_generator.py`, specifically in the block of code related to `if isinstance(val_data, Sequence)`. The error message indicates that `steps=None` is only valid for a generator based on the `keras.utils.Sequence` class and suggests specifying `steps` or using the `keras.utils.Sequence` class.

The bug occurs because the code in the `fit_generator` function does not handle the case where `validation_data` is an instance of `Sequence` properly. The validation steps are not calculated correctly in this case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code inside the `fit_generator` function to handle the case where `validation_data` is an instance of `Sequence` properly and calculate the `validation_steps` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `fit_generator` function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...
    
    if validation_data:
        do_validation = True
        val_gen = isinstance(validation_data, Sequence)
        if val_gen:
            validation_steps = len(validation_data)  # Calculate validation steps if validation_data is a Sequence

        # ... (continue with the rest of the code) ...

    return model.history
```

In the corrected code, we check if `validation_data` is provided and if it's an instance of `Sequence`. If it is, we calculate the `validation_steps` based on the length of the `validation_data` Sequence. This ensures that the steps are properly handled for `validation_data` that is an instance of `Sequence`.
