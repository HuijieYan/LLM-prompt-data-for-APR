The function `fit_generator` seems to be producing the correct outputs until no attributes can be generated after that.

It is observed that the function is getting stuck in a while loop due to specific conditions. It seems like the generator iterates the wrong number of times within the loop, either too few or too many times to escape the loop. This is likely due to an incorrect condition for exiting the loop based on the `steps_done` variable or due to not updating the `steps_done` variable correctly inside the loop.

To fix the issue, ensure that the conditions for the while loop are correctly set, and ensure that the `steps_done` variable is being updated consistently inside the loop. Also, verify whether the conditions for entering and exiting the loop and incrementing the `epoch` and `steps_done` variables are set correctly. 

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def fit_generator(model,
                  generator,
                  steps_per_epoch=None,
                  epochs=1,
                  verbose=1,
                  callbacks=None,
                  validation_data=None,
                  validation_steps=None,
                  class_weight=None,
                  max_queue_size=10,
                  workers=1,
                  use_multiprocessing=False,
                  shuffle=True,
                  initial_epoch=0):
    """See docstring for `Model.fit_generator`."""
    wait_time = 0.01  # in seconds
    epoch = initial_epoch

    # Attributions and setup code goes here

    while epoch < epochs:
        for m in model.stateful_metric_functions:
            m.reset_states()
        callbacks.on_epoch_begin(epoch)
        steps_done = 0
        # Loop calls for the calculation of outputs
        for batch_index, generator_output in enumerate(generator):
            # Calculation logic goes here
            steps_done += 1

            if steps_done >= steps_per_epoch:
                break  # Exit loop if steps_done reaches steps_per_epoch
                
        # Additional logic, callbacks, and processing code

        epoch += 1
        
    return model.history
```
