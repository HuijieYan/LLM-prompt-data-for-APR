The `clone_model` function seems to be encountering an issue where it cannot compute the output tensor. This is likely due to the `Layer.compute_mask()` method always returning `None` for layers that do not support masks, such as the `Lambda` layer.

The bug is likely occurring in the `clone_model` function at the point where it tries to compute the output masks using the `Layer.compute_mask()` method.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `clone_model` function to handle cases where the `Layer.compute_mask()` method returns `None`. One approach could be to only call the `Layer.compute_mask()` method if the layer supports masking, and if it does not, the output masks should be set to `None` explicitly.

Here's the corrected code for the `clone_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # (existing code)
    for x, y in zip(reference_input_tensors, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    # ... (existing code remains the same)

    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)

    # Set the output masks to None explicitly
    output_masks = [None for _ in model.outputs]

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly set the `output_masks` to `None` if the `Layer.compute_mask()` method returns `None` or if the layer does not support masking.

By making this change, the bug related to the "Could not compute output Tensor" error when using `clone_model` should be resolved.
