The potential error location within the problematic function is in the part of the function responsible for cloning the layers.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to clone a functional `Model` instance, but it mistakenly checks whether the input model is an instance of `Sequential` instead of `Model`. This creates a conflict in terms of checking the input model type.

To fix the bug:
1. Check for the input model type using `isinstance(model, Sequential)` and replace it with `isinstance(model, Model)`.
2. Provide proper error messages to indicate the specific issue when invalid model types are passed to the function.
3. Ensure that all input parameters for the function are handled correctly and consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    """Clone a functional `Model` instance.
    ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    """
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if input_tensors is None:
        # Create placeholders to build the model on top of.
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape, dtype=layer.dtype, sparse=layer.sparse, name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]
    else:
        input_tensors = to_list(input_tensors)
        for index, x in enumerate(input_tensors):
            if not K.is_keras_tensor(x):
                name = model._input_layers[index].name
                input_tensors[index] = Input(tensor=x, name='input_wrapper_for_' + name)
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
This corrected code first checks whether the input model is an instance of `Model`, and then handles the input tensors accordingly. Adjustments have been made to ensure a consistent approach for handling input parameters and to provide clear error messages for invalid model types.
