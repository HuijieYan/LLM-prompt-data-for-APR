The error message "Could not compute output Tensor" is related to the usage of clone_model() function in Keras. The test case provided creates a simple model and then attempts to clone it using clone_model(). This is where the error is encountered, indicating that the output tensor cannot be computed.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the output tensors are being computed and validated. This is evident from the error message indicating that the output cannot be computed.

The bug occurs because the output_masks are expected to have a non-None value, but due to the usage of Lambda layer that does not support masks, the output_masks are always set to None. This leads to the error message "Could not compute output Tensor" because the computed output_masks are not as expected.

To fix this bug, one approach is to handle the case where the output_masks are expected to be None due to the usage of a layer that does not support masks. This could involve checking the type of the layer and handling the output_masks accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code...

    computed_masks = [None] * len(computed_tensors)  # Initialize computed_masks to None
    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
            kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
    output_tensors = to_list(
        layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
    output_masks = to_list(None for _ in computed_tensors)  # Set output_masks to a list of None values

    # existing code...

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
