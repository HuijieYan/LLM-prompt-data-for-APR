The test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` is creating a model with multiple outputs and then attempting to clone the model using `keras.models.clone_model`. This means the `new_model` will have the same architecture as the original `model` but with newly instantiated weights.

The error occurs in the `_clone_functional_model` function at `assert x in tensor_map`, which means the function is unable to compute the output tensor. This is likely due to a problem with the computation of output tensors and the `tensor_map`.

The bug occurs because the code is not handling the case where a layer is an `InputLayer`. When the code checks for `InputLayer`, it just continues the loop without adding it to the `layer_map`, which will lead to issues when trying to compute the output.

To fix this bug, we should modify the code to properly handle the case where a layer is an `InputLayer` and add it to the `layer_map`. Additionally, we can update the error handling to provide a more informative error message.

Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import keras
from keras.models import Model, Sequential
from keras import backend as K
import numpy as np
from keras.layers import Input, InputLayer

# Buggy function source code
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other lines of code remain unchanged)

    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                layer_map[layer] = layer
                continue

            # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

This corrected code specifically handles the case where the layer is an `InputLayer`. By adding this explicit handling, we ensure that the `InputLayer` is properly added to the `layer_map` and can be used in computing the output tensors. Additionally, no changes have been made to the validation checks or other parts of the code, as they appear to be functioning correctly.
