The issue arises from the `assert` statement within the `_clone_functional_model` function. The `assert` statement checks if all model outputs are present in the `tensor_map`, and it raises an `AssertionError` with the message 'Could not compute output' if any output is missing.

Based on the error message and the code, the function fails to compute the output tensors correctly if a layer has more outputs without mask support, resulting in some output tensors not being added to the `tensor_map`.

To fix this bug, the `assert` statement should be removed, and a check should be performed to verify that all output tensors are present in the `tensor_map`. If any output tensor is missing, it should raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.

Below is the corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    # Check if all output tensors are in tensor_map
    for x in model.outputs:
        if x not in tensor_map:
            raise ValueError('Could not compute output', x)

    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
