The test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` involves creating a Keras model with multiple input and output layers and then trying to clone the original model using the `keras.models.clone_model` function. The error message points to an assertion error raised during the cloning process where it could not compute the output tensor.

Upon reviewing the provided `_clone_functional_model` function, it's clear that this function is designed to clone a functional `Model` instance with new layers and weights instead of sharing existing layers and weights. The bug stems from the fact that the implementation of the cloning logic within the `_clone_functional_model` function is prone to errors.

The apparent issue in the `_clone_functional_model` function is that certain tensors and layers are not properly mapped during the cloning process, leading to an assertion error when computing the model outputs. Additionally, the logic for handling the model cloning in the function is convoluted and prone to issues related to input tensor mapping and layer cloning.

To address this issue and optimize the cloning logic, the function should be refactored to ensure correct mapping of input tensors and layers during the cloning process, as well as to simplify and optimize the layer cloning and tensor mapping.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function with the aforementioned optimizations and improvements:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, InputLayer
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
import numpy as np

def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in model._input_layers]

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for depth in sorted(model._nodes_by_depth.keys(), reverse=True):
        for node in model._nodes_by_depth[depth]:
            inbound_layer = node.inbound_layer
            if inbound_layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = inbound_layer.__class__.from_config(inbound_layer.get_config())
                layer_map[inbound_layer] = new_layer
            else:
                new_layer = layer_map[inbound_layer]
                if isinstance(new_layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors
            computed_data = []

            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    if 'mask' in kwargs and \
                            hasattr(new_layer, 'call') and 'mask' not in kwargs:
                        kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                    output_tensors = K.function([computed_tensor], [new_layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs)])([computed_tensor])
                else:
                    computed_tensors, computed_masks = zip(*computed_data)
                    if 'mask' in kwargs and \
                            hasattr(new_layer, 'call') and 'mask' not in kwargs:
                        kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                    output_tensors = K.function(computed_tensors, [new_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs)])(computed_tensors)

                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This version of the `_clone_functional_model` function includes optimizations for layer and tensor mapping, as well as improved handling of input tensors and layers during the model cloning process. With these enhancements, the function should be able to clone a functional Keras model successfully, addressing the previous assertion error.
