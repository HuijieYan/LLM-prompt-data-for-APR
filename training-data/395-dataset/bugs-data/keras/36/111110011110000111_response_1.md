The error message indicates that the separable convolution operation is trying to use strides with different lengths in the row and column dimensions. This is not supported in the current implementation.

Looking at the `separable_conv1d` function, it seems that the issue may be related to the transformation of 1D convolution into 2D convolution operations internally using TensorFlow. This transformation may be causing the mismatch in strides between row and column dimensions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the transformation from 1D to 2D convolution maintains compatible dimensions for strides. It's also important to correctly apply the transformation from 1D to 2D convolution, taking into consideration that separable convolutions involve both depthwise and pointwise convolutions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def separable_conv1d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel, strides=1,
                     padding='valid', data_format=None, dilation_rate=1):
    if data_format is None:
        data_format = tf.keras.backend.image_data_format()
    if data_format not in {'channels_first', 'channels_last'}:
        raise ValueError('Unknown data_format: ' + str(data_format))

    x, tf_data_format = _preprocess_conv1d_input(x, data_format)
    padding = _preprocess_padding(padding)
    if tf_data_format == 'NHWC':
        spatial_start_dim = 1
        strides = (1, ) + strides + (1, )
    else:
        spatial_start_dim = 2
        strides = (1, 1) + strides
    x = tf.expand_dims(x, spatial_start_dim)
    depthwise_kernel = tf.expand_dims(depthwise_kernel, 0)
    pointwise_kernel = tf.expand_dims(pointwise_kernel, 0)
    dilation_rate = (1, ) + dilation_rate + (1, )

    if tf_data_format == 'NHWC':
        x = tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d(x, depthwise_kernel, strides=strides,
                                   padding=padding, rate=dilation_rate,
                                   data_format=tf_data_format)
        x = tf.nn.conv2d(x, pointwise_kernel, strides=(1, 1, 1, 1),
                         padding=padding, data_format=tf_data_format)
    else:
        x = tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d(x, depthwise_kernel, strides=strides,
                                   padding=padding, rate=dilation_rate,
                                   data_format=tf_data_format)
        x = tf.nn.conv2d(x, pointwise_kernel, strides=(1, 1, 1, 1),
                         padding=padding, data_format=tf_data_format)

    x = tf.squeeze(x, [spatial_start_dim])

    if data_format == 'channels_first' and tf_data_format == 'NHWC':
        x = tf.transpose(x, (0, 2, 1))  # NWC -> NCW

    return x
```

In the corrected code, the separable convolution operation is explicitly implemented as a combination of depthwise convolution followed by pointwise convolution. Instead of using `tf.nn.separable_conv2d`, which might cause the issue with strides, the code uses `tf.nn.depthwise_conv2d` followed by `tf.nn.conv2d` separately.

This approach is more explicit and allows for better control over the convolution operations, ensuring that the strides are properly handled for both depthwise and pointwise convolutions.
