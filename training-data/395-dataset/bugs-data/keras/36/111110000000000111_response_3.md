Potential error location: The error may be occurring at the `tf_data_format` variable or at the `tf.nn.separable_conv2d` function where it's attempting to perform a 2D convolution instead of a 1D convolution.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is trying to perform a separable convolution in 1D, but it mistakenly uses the `tf.nn.separable_conv2d` function, which is intended for 2D convolution.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Replace the `tf.nn.separable_conv2d` with the appropriate 1D separable convolution function, and ensure that the input shapes and dimensions match the expected 1D convolution requirements.

Corrected code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def separable_conv1d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel, strides=1,
                     padding='valid', data_format=None, dilation_rate=1):
    #... (same as original function)

    x = tf.expand_dims(x, -1)  # Add a new axis for 1D convolution

    x = tf.nn.separable_conv1d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel,
                               strides=strides,
                               padding=padding,
                               rate=dilation_rate,
                               data_format=data_format)

    x = tf.squeeze(x, -1)  # Remove the added axis

    return x
