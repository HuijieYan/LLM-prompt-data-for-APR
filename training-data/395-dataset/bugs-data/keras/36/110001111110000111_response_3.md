The error message suggests that there is an issue with the strides in the row and column dimensions of the convolution operation. Looking at the function `separable_conv1d`, it seems that the problem might be related to how the strides are being handled in the code.

It is likely that the bug is occurring because the `strides` variable is being used in a non-standard way or not being properly converted to match the expected format.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to adjust how the `strides` are being handled in the `separable_conv1d` function. This could involve converting the `strides` to a format that is compatible with the convolution operation being performed. Additionally, it may be necessary to make changes to how the `strides` are being used in the `_preprocess_conv1d_input` function and ensure that it matches the expected format for the convolution operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `separable_conv1d` function:

```python
def separable_conv1d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel, strides=1,
                     padding='valid', data_format=None, dilation_rate=1):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Adjusting strides based on data_format
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        strides = (1, strides)
    else:
        strides = (strides, 1)

    x, tf_data_format = _preprocess_conv1d_input(x, data_format)
    padding = _preprocess_padding(padding)
    x = tf.expand_dims(x, -1)
    depthwise_kernel = tf.expand_dims(depthwise_kernel, -2)
    x = tf.nn.separable_conv1d(x, depthwise_kernel, pointwise_kernel,
                               strides=strides,
                               padding=padding,
                               rate=dilation_rate,
                               data_format=tf_data_format)
    x = tf.squeeze(x, -1)

    if data_format == 'channels_first' and tf_data_format == 'NHWC':
        x = tf.transpose(x, (0, 2, 1))  # NWC -> NCW

    return x
```

In this corrected code, the `strides` are adjusted based on the `data_format` and are used in a format compatible with the convolution operation. Additionally, the expansion and squeezing of dimensions are also adjusted to ensure compatibility with the convolution operation and data format.
