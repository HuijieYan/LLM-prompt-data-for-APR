The error occurs because the `maketrans` function is used incorrectly. In Python, the `maketrans` function expects two strings of equal length. However, in the buggy code, the `split` parameter is used to create a string of the same length as the `filters`, but this may not always be the case when `split` is a multi-character string.

To fix this issue, we can use a different approach to achieve the desired behavior of splitting the text. One way to approach this is to use the `re` module in Python to split the text based on a multi-character delimiter.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function with the fix implemented:

```python
import re

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    text = re.sub('[' + re.escape(filters) + ']', split, text)  # Replace all filter characters with the split string
    seq = text.split(split)  # Split the text using the split string
    return [i for i in seq if i]  # Filter out empty strings from the result
```

With this implementation, the `re` module is used to replace all filter characters with the split string, and then the text is split using the split string. This ensures that the text is correctly split based on the multi-character delimiter provided.

The corrected code should resolve the issue and allow the function to handle multi-character split strings properly.
