The error is occurring in the `text_to_word_sequence` function, specifically at the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`. The `maketrans` function is expecting two strings of equal length, but the `filters` and `split` arguments in this case have different lengths. This is causing the `ValueError` to be raised.

The reason behind this bug is that the `maketrans` function expects two strings of equal length but it is being called with arguments of different lengths. This issue arises when using a multi-character split marker.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `translate_map` assignment line to use a dictionary comprehension to create the mapping. Additionally, you can remove the unnecessary check for Python 2 compatibility.

Here is the corrected code for `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this correction, the `maketrans` function is replaced with a dictionary comprehension to create the `translate_map`, which resolves the issue of having unequal length arguments. Additionally, the unnecessary Python 2 compatibility check has been removed.
