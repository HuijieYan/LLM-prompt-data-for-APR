The error message is indicating that there is a problem with the `maketrans` function due to unequal length of the first two arguments. This function is used to create a translation table that maps individual characters. 

The issue stems from the line:
```python
translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
```

The `maketrans` function expects two strings of equal length as input. In this case, `filters` is a string with a specific set of characters, and `split` is another string that is intended to be repeated to match the length of `filters`. However, if `split` has more than one character, the multiplication in `split * len(filters)` will result in a string with a different length than `filters`, causing the `ValueError`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the way the translation map is generated to ensure that the lengths of the two strings are equal.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
    # Correcting the translation map generation
    translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this fix, the translation map is generated using `str.maketrans` to ensure that the lengths of the two strings passed as arguments are equal. This will resolve the `ValueError` that was occurring due to the unequal length of the input strings for `maketrans`.
