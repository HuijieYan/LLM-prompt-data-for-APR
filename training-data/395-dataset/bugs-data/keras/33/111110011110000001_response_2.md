The error in the code is caused by the function `maketrans` where it is used with two arguments (filters and split) of different lengths in the else block of the `text_to_word_sequence` function. The `maketrans` function requires the two arguments to have an equal length.

To fix this bug, we can modify the way the translation map is created using `maketrans` method. Instead of creating a map based on the length of split, it's better to iterate over each character in the filters and build a dictionary that replaces each character with the split character.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]

# Test function
def test_text_to_word_sequence_multichar_split():
    text = 'hello!stop?world!'
    assert text_to_word_sequence(text, split='stop') == ['hello', 'world']

def test_text_to_word_sequence_unicode_multichar_split():
    text = u'ali!stopveli?stopkırkstopdokuzstopelli'
    assert text_to_word_sequence(text, split='stop') == [u'ali', u'veli', u'kırk', u'dokuz', u'elli']
```

With this correction, the `text_to_word_sequence` function should work properly for both test cases.
