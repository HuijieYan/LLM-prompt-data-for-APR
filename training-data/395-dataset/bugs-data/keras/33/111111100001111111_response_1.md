The bug occurs because the `maketrans` function used to create the translation map requires both parameters to have equal length. In the buggy code, the `filters` and `split` parameters have different lengths, causing the ValueError.

To fix this bug, the `translate_map` should be created by replacing the `maketrans` function with a manual mapping of characters to the split value.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()
    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

By using `translate_dict` for manual mapping of characters to the split value, we can avoid the ValueError caused by using `maketrans` with unequally sized arguments.
