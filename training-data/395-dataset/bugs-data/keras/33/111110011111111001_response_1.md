The error is due to the `maketrans` function, which requires equal length arguments for Python 3. The code is using `maketrans` with different lengths for `filters` and `split * len(filters)`.

To fix this issue, you can use a translation table for replacing each character in the `filters` with the corresponding character in the `split`. The translation table can be created using `str.maketrans` if it is available in the Python version being used.

Here's the fixed code:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)

    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This code removes the dependency on `maketrans` for creating the translation map and uses a dictionary to define the translations instead.

The test cases should now pass without any errors.
