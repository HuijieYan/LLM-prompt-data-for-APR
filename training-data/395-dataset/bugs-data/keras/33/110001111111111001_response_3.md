The error occurs in the `translate_map` assignment where the `maketrans` function is used. This function requires two strings of equal length, but in this case, the `split * len(filters)` part causes the length mismatch. This occurs because `split` is a string and `filters` is another string, and multiplying a string by an integer results in that string being repeated a number of times.

To fix this bug, the `maketrans` function must be used with two strings of equal length. The potential approach for fixing the bug is to create a translation table using the `str.maketrans()` method. This method accepts two strings of equal length where the first is the string of characters to replace and the second is the string of replacement characters. The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {''.join([chr(i) for i in range(256) if chr(i) in filters]): split * len(filters)}
    translate_map = str.maketrans(translate_dict)

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected code replaces the use of `maketrans` with the creation of a translation dictionary `translate_dict` that maps each character in `filters` to the string `split` repeated `len(filters)` times. Then, the `str.maketrans()` method is used with this dictionary to create the translation table.
