The error occurs because the `maketrans()` function in the `text_to_word_sequence` method expects the two arguments to have equal length, but in our case, the `filters` and `split` arguments have different lengths. This leads to the ValueError.

To fix this issue, we can use the `str.translate()` method to create a translation table for the `filters` and `split` string, then use this translation table to replace characters in the input `text`.
Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` method:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

The `translate_dict` is created using a dictionary comprehension to map each character in `filters` to the `split` string. Then, the `translate()` method is used to replace the characters in the input `text` using the `translate_dict`. This will fix the issue and allow the method to handle cases where the `split` string has multiple characters.
