The bug is occurring in the `text_to_word_sequence` function due to the way it handles the `filters` parameter when it contains multiple characters. The bug is causing the `maketrans` function to malfunction, resulting in a ValueError during text tokenization.

The reason behind the bug is that the `maketrans` function expects the two arguments to have equal length. However, when the `filters` string has more than one character, the `maketrans` function is unable to process it correctly and raises a ValueError.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle multi-character filters properly. This can be achieved by creating a dictionary to map the characters in the `filters` string to the `split` string. Then, the `str.translate` method can be used to replace the characters in the `text` with the corresponding characters in the `split` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {}
    for c in filters:
        translate_dict[ord(c)] = split * len(c)

    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected code handles multi-character filters properly and should fix the tokenization bug when using the `text_to_word_sequence` function.
