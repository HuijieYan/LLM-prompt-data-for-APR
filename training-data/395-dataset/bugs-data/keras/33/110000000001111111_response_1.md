The potential error location within the function is the use of the `maketrans` function with unequal lengths for the two arguments. This is evident in the error message that states "the first two maketrans arguments must have equal length."

The bug occurs because the `maketrans` function expects two arguments of equal length, but the length of the `filters` argument and the `split` argument is not necessarily equal.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to create a translation map using a dictionary comprehension instead of using the `maketrans` and `translate` methods. This will ensure that the translation map only contains the necessary character substitutions without needing to worry about equal lengths.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

By using the `translate_dict` to create the translation map and applying it to the input text, we can ensure that the function works as expected and does not encounter the error caused by unequal lengths in the `maketrans` function.
