The bug in the provided function is due to the `maketrans` function being used with filters of different lengths. The function uses `filters` and `split` to create the translation map, but if the `split` string has more than one character, this causes the error.

To fix this bug, the `maketrans` function needs to be replaced with a custom translation function that can handle different lengths of `filters` and `split`.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected code uses a `translate_dict` instead of `maketrans` to handle filters with different lengths, which resolves the error related to the length of the arguments passed to `maketrans`.
