The error occurs in the `text_to_word_sequence` function due to the `maketrans` method, which is being used with `filters` and `split`. The error message indicates that the first two `maketrans` arguments must have equal length.

The reason behind this bug is that the `maketrans` method expects two strings of equal length as arguments. In the buggy function, `filters` and `split` do not have the same length, causing the `ValueError` during the translation process.

To fix this bug, the `maketrans` method should be used differently. One possible approach is to use a dictionary to map each character in `filters` to the corresponding character in `split`, and then use the `translate` method with this mapping.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected code uses a dictionary `translate_dict` to store the mapping between characters in `filters` and `split`, and then utilizes the `translate` method to perform the translation. The bug has been fixed by using the `translate` method with the correct mapping.
