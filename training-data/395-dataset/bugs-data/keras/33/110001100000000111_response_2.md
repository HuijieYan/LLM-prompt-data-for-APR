The issue is that when the `split` parameter has more than one character, the `maketrans` function is throwing an error because the two arguments must have equal length.

The potential error location is in the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))` where the length of `split` is not the same as the length of `filters`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the maketrans function requires two arguments of equal length, and when the `split` parameter has more than one character, it causes the length to be different.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))` to use a different method for creating the translation map when `split` has more than one character.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        if len(split) > 1:
            translate_map = str.maketrans({key : split for key in filters})
        else:
            translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
        
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this correction, the function will now handle cases where the `split` parameter has more than one character without throwing an error.
