Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `maketrans` function call, where the length of the arguments passed to it are not equal, causing the ValueError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `maketrans` function requires the two first arguments to be of equal length. In the provided function, the `filters` and `split * len(filters)` do not have equal length when `split` has more than one character.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach is to use the `str.maketrans` function to create the translation table, as it automatically handles the case where the lengths of the arguments are not equal.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
