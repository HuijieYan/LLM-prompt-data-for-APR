The error message indicates that there is a ValueError because the first two maketrans arguments must have equal length. This suggests that there is an issue with the `maketrans` function in the `text_to_word_sequence` method.

The potential error in the code is when creating the `translate_map` using `maketrans`. The `maketrans` function requires two arguments of equal length, but in the buggy code, the second argument is not of the same length as the first argument.

The bug occurs because the `maketrans` function in the original code multiplies the `split` string by the length of the `filters` string. This creates a mismatch in the lengths of the two arguments passed to `maketrans`, leading to a ValueError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to create a translation table using the `str.translate()` method, which allows for a direct mapping of characters to their replacements.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string) - This will not be used in the corrected code.

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split()
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

In this corrected code:
- We removed the conditional check for Python 3 because str.translate() is consistent across Python 2 and Python 3.
- We replaced the usage of `maketrans` with the `translate` method, which directly maps characters to their replacements. This avoids the need to create a translation table with equal-length arguments.
