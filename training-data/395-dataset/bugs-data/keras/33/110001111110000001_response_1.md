The error message indicates that there is a ValueError at line 44 in the 'text_to_word_sequence' function in the 'text.py' file. This error is caused by the 'maketrans' function, specifically by the arguments passed to it.

The bug is occurring because the length of the 'filters' and 'split * len(filters)' are not equal. This is due to the fact that 'filters' and 'split * len(filters)' are not of the same length.

To fix this bug, the 'maketrans' function should be replaced with a custom function that creates a translation table between the characters in 'filters' and 'split'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
