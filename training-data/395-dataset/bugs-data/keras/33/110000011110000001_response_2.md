The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `maketrans` function on line 44 of the `text_to_word_sequence` function. The error message specifically states "ValueError: the first two `maketrans` arguments must have equal length."

The issue is likely caused by the difference in length between the `filters` and `split * len(filters)` arguments passed to `maketrans`. The `filters` string is a sequence of characters to filter out, and `split` is a sentence split marker. If the `split` string is longer than the `filters` string when multiplied by the length of `filters`, the arguments will not have equal length.

To fix this bug, we can use the `str.maketrans` method to create the translation map. We also need to import the `str` module at the beginning of the file to use this method.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
