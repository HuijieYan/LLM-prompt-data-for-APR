The issue with the code is that the `maketrans` function is being used without importing it from the `string` module. Additionally, `sys` module is being used without being imported. 

The `maketrans` function is used to create a translation table that maps the individual characters in the input string to other individual characters. This can be used along with the `translate` function on strings to replace characters. 

To fix the bug, we need to import the `maketrans` function from the `string` module. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import string

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]

```
