The test case `test_text_to_word_sequence_multichar_split` contains the input text "hello!stop?world!" with the split marker "stop", expecting the output to be the list ['hello', 'world']. However, the error message indicates a ValueError in the `maketrans` function, which is caused when the first two arguments of `maketrans` have different lengths.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`.

The bug occurs because the `maketrans` function requires the first two arguments to have equal length, but in this case, `filters` and `split * len(filters)` have different lengths.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that `filters` and `split * len(filters)` have the same length. This can be achieved by padding `split` to match the length of `filters`.

Here is the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        padding = split * len(filters)
        translate_map = maketrans(filters, padding)

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

In this corrected code, the `maketrans` function is used with `filters` and `padding` to make sure they have the same length, thereby resolving the ValueError issue.
