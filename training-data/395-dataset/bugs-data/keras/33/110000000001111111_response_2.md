The bug occurs because the `maketrans()` function requires two strings with equal length, but in the provided code, the `filters` and `split * len(filters)` do not have equal length when `split` has more than one character.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code as follows:
- Instead of using `maketrans()` and `translate_map`, we can use the `translate()` method of strings, which allows us to specify a translation table as a dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {c: split for c in filters}
    translate_dict.update({ord(c): split for c in filters})
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
