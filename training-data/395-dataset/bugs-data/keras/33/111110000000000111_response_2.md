Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `maketrans` function, specifically with regards to the length of the arguments.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because when `split` has more than one character, the length of `filters` and `split * len(filters)` will not be equal, causing `maketrans` to raise a ValueError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by using a different approach for translation, such as regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import re

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    text = re.sub('[' + re.escape(filters) + ']', split, text)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

The corrected code uses the `re.sub` function to replace characters in the `filters` with the `split` character. This approach avoids the issue of mismatched lengths that occurred with `maketrans`.
