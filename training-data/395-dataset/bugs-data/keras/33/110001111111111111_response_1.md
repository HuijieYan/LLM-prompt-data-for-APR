In the test case, the function `text_to_word_sequence` is called with the parameter `split='stop'`, indicating that the split marker is the word "stop". This implies that the function should split the input text at every occurrence of the word "stop" and return a list of the segments. However, the error message indicates that there is a problem with the `maketrans` function, specifically that "the first two maketrans arguments must have equal length."

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `maketrans` function. This function is used to create a translation table that maps each character in the `filters` string to the corresponding character in the `split` string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the length of the `filters` and `split` strings is different, causing the `maketrans` function to raise a `ValueError` due to the unequal lengths.

To fix the bug, the lengths of the `filters` and `split` strings should be aligned before passing them to the `maketrans` function. This can be achieved by padding the `split` string to match the length of the `filters` string.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        if len(split) > 1:
            split_table = {ord(c): split for c in set(filters)}
            translate_map = str.maketrans(split_table)
        else:
            translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

In the corrected code, if the length of the `split` string is greater than 1, a translation table is created to map each character in the `filters` string to the `split` string. Otherwise, the `maketrans` function is used as before. This fix ensures that the `maketrans` function will not raise a `ValueError` due to unequal lengths of the input strings.
