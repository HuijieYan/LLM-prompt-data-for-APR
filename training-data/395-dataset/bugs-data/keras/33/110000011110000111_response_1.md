The test case "test_text_to_word_sequence_multichar_split" is trying to split the text using a multi-character split marker ("stop") instead of a single character. This is causing an error because the current implementation of the "text_to_word_sequence" function uses the "maketrans" function to create a translation map, and this function requires that the first two arguments have equal length.

The bug occurs because the "maketrans" function is expecting the filters and split arguments to have equal length, but in the case of a multi-character split marker, the length of the split marker is longer than the length of the filters.

One approach to fix this bug is to use the regular expression module to replace the split marker with a space before splitting the text. This will allow for using a multi-character split marker without the need for equal length arguments in the "maketrans" function.

Here's the corrected code for the "text_to_word_sequence" function:

```python
import re

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    text = re.sub('[%s]' % re.escape(filters), split, text)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this implementation, the function uses the "re.sub" function to replace the split marker with a space, and then uses the split function to split the text into words. This allows for using a multi-character split marker without causing an error related to the length of arguments in the "maketrans" function.
