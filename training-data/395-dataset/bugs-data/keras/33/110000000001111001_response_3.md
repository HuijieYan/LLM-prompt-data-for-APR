The bug in the given code is that it's using 'maketrans' and 'translate' functions, which are not defined in the code.

The potential error location is in the 'translate_map' definition and usage where 'maketrans' and 'translate' functions are being used.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'maketrans' and 'translate' functions are not imported or defined in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to import the 'str' module to access 'maketrans' and 'translate' functions for Python 2. For Python 3, it is suggested to use the string method `translate`. Additionally, we'll handle the 'filters' variable properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), ord(split)) for c in filters)
        text = text.translate(translate_map)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
        text = text.translate(translate_map)

    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
