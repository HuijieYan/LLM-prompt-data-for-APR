The bug occurs in the translation step of the code, where the length of the `filters` and `split` parameters are not equal, causing the `maketrans` function to raise a ValueError.

To fix this bug, we can create a new translation map by using the `str.maketrans` method to create a translation map with the same length as the `filters` parameter.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

This corrected code uses the `str.maketrans` method to create a translation map with the same length as the `filters` parameter, resolving the ValueError that occurred in the original code.
