The issue is occurring because the length of the `filters` and `split` strings is not the same, which leads to the `maketrans` function failure. The function is designed to replace characters in a string with the character at the same position as the corresponding character in the second argument.

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to ensure that the `filters` and `split` strings have the same length. If they don't, we can pad the `split` string to match the length of the `filters` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), unicode(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        if len(split) < len(filters):
            split += " " * (len(filters) - len(split))  # pad split string to match the length of filters
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split)

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this modification, the function will be able to handle cases where the `split` string has a different length than the `filters` string. Now, the function will work as intended and the issue related to the tokenization crashing when the split string has more than one character should be resolved.
