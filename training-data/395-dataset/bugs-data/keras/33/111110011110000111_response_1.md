The test case `test_text_to_word_sequence_multichar_split` is trying to split the input text at the occurrence of the word "stop". The function `text_to_word_sequence` is expected to split the text and return `['hello', 'world']`. However, the error message indicates that there is an issue with the `maketrans` function, specifically with the length of the arguments passed to it.

The error is occurring because when the `split` parameter has more than one character, the `maketrans` function is unable to handle it because it requires the two arguments passed to it to be of equal length.

To fix the issue, we need to update the code to handle multi-character splits by implementing a custom splitting mechanism.

Here is the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    for char in filters:
        text = text.replace(char, split)

    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this updated code, the function first replaces all the characters specified in `filters` with the `split` character. Then it splits the text at the `split` character and returns the list of words. This approach handles multi-character splits without using `maketrans` and resolves the issue observed in the test cases.
