The bug in the code is caused by the use of the `maketrans` function, which attempts to create a translation table for translating characters in the input string. However, it is being used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we should use the `str.maketrans` method to create the translation table.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = text.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
    
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
