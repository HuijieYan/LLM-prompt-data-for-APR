Potential Error Location: The error is likely to occur in the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`, where the `maketrans` function is used to create a translation table for the `translate` method.

Reasons for the Occurrence of the Bug: The error occurs because the `maketrans` function is not defined in the current scope, leading to a `NameError`. Additionally, the condition `if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, unicode):` may also cause an error as `unicode` is not defined in Python 3.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Import the required functions from the appropriate module, such as `maketrans` from `string` and `sys` for version checking.
2. Instead of using `isinstance(text, unicode)`, utilize a try-except block to handle the Unicode conversion appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import sys
from string import maketrans

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), split) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
