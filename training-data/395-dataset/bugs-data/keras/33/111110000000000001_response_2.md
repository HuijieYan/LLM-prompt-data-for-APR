Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the "translate_map" assignment, where the "maketrans" method is being used.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The "maketrans" method is not being called from the correct library, and there is a missing import statement for "sys".

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Import the "sys" library at the beginning of the code.
2. Use the correct method for creating the translation map, which is "str.maketrans" instead of just "maketrans".

Corrected code:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
