The bug occurs in the translation of characters to the split marker. The translate_map is not created properly and leads to incorrect splitting of the text. This is because the `maketrans` function is not being used correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to use the correct method to create the translate_map.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys
import string

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), ord(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this correction, the translate_map is created using `str.maketrans` for Python 3 and a dictionary comprehension with `ord` for characters for Python 2. This will fix the issue with character translation and provide the correct list of words.
