The error occurs in the `text_to_word_sequence` function on this line:

```python
translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
```

The reason for the bug is that the `filters` and `split` variables do not have the same length, which causes the `maketrans` function to raise a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `translate_map` creation to use a dictionary where each character from `filters` is mapped to the single `split` character using the `str.maketrans` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {c: split for c in filters}
    translate_map = str.maketrans(translate_dict)
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

With this correction, the `text_to_word_sequence` function should work correctly for both single and multi-character split markers.
