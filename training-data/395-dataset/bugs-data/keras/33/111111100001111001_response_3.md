The bug seems to be related to the creation of the `translate_map` variable, and its usage in the `text.translate()` method. The code is using `maketrans()` function, which is intended to generate a translation table for `str.translate()`. However, the bug most likely occurs due to the incorrect usage of the `maketrans()` function.

To fix the bug, the `str.maketrans()` function should be used to create the translation table. This function creates a translation table suitable for passing to `str.translate()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `text_to_word_sequence` function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```

In the corrected code, the `translate_map` is replaced with `translate_dict`, and it uses the `ord` function to create the translation table. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as intended.
