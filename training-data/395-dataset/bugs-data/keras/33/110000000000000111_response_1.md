The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`. The error occurs because the `maketrans` function expects two strings of equal length, but in this case, the `filters` and `split` strings are not of equal length.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `maketrans` function is being used incorrectly. It is attempting to create a mapping between the characters in the `filters` string and the characters in the `split` string, but it requires both strings to be of equal length.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `str.maketrans()` method to create the translation table, rather than trying to create it manually. This will ensure that the two strings passed to `str.maketrans()` are of equal length.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))
    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
