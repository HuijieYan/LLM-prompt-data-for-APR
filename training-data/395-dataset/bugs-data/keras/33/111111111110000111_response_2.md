1. The test case is trying to split the text using a multicharacter string ('stop').

2. The potential error location is the line with the `maketrans` function: `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`

3. The bug occurs because in Python 3, the arguments for `maketrans` must have equal length. In this case, the `filters` and `split * len(filters)` do not have equal lengths.

4. To fix the bug, we can use a different approach to achieve the same result of translating characters. One possible approach is to use the `str.translate` method while creating the `translate_map` dictionary.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text, filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n', lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    translate_dict = {ord(c): split for c in filters}
    text = text.translate(translate_dict)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
