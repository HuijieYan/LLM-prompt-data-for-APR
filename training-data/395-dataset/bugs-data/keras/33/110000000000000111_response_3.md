The error is occurring because the `maketrans` function requires the two input strings to have equal length, but in the provided function, the `filters` and `split` strings may have different lengths.

The potential error location is the line `translate_map = maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))`.

The reason for the bug is that the `maketrans` function expects two strings of equal length, but in the provided function, the `split` string may have a different length than the `filters` string.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `split` string has the same length as the `filters` string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import sys

def text_to_word_sequence(text,
                          filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
                          lower=True, split=" "):
    """Converts a text to a sequence of words (or tokens).

    # Arguments
        text: Input text (string).
        filters: Sequence of characters to filter out.
        lower: Whether to convert the input to lowercase.
        split: Sentence split marker (string).

    # Returns
        A list of words (or tokens).
    """
    if lower:
        text = text.lower()

    if sys.version_info < (3,) and isinstance(text, str):
        translate_map = dict((ord(c), ord(split)) for c in filters)
    else:
        translate_map = str.maketrans(filters, split * len(filters))

    text = text.translate(translate_map)
    seq = text.split(split)
    return [i for i in seq if i]
```
