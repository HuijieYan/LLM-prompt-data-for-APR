The error occurs when the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function is called inside the `ctc_batch_cost` function. In the error message, it is mentioned that the issue is related to getting a slice index of dimension 0 out of bounds.

The potential error location is identified as the line:
```python
sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `y_true` is a single sample (i.e., when `batch_size = 1`), the shape of `y_true` might not be handled properly, leading to an out of bounds error when trying to access dimension 0.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the batch size is 1 separately to ensure that the dimensions are handled correctly.

The corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function is as follows:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
    
    # Handle the case when batch_size = 1 separately
    if tf.shape(y_true)[0] == 1:
        sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(tf.expand_dims(y_true, axis=0))
    else:
        sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case when the batch size is 1 separately by directly converting the dense `y_true` to sparse format using `tf.sparse.from_dense`. This should resolve the issue of getting a slice index of dimension 0 out of bounds when the batch size is 1.
