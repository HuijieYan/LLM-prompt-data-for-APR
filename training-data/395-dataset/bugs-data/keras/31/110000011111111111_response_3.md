The error is occurring in the `ctc_batch_cost` function, specifically in the line `sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))`. The error message indicates that the index 0 of dimension 0 is out of bounds, suggesting an issue with accessing the shape of the tensor.

The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the shape of the input tensors. When the batch size is 1, the shape of the input tensors may cause issues with indexing and accessing the dimensions.

To fix the bug, the code needs to appropriately handle the shape of the input tensors when the batch size is 1. This may involve adding conditional checks to handle the special case of batch size 1 differently.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length)
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.to_dense(tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true, is_sorted=True), default_value=-1)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                        logits=y_pred,
                                        label_length=label_length,
                                        logit_length=input_length,
                                        logits_time_major=True), 1)
```

In the corrected function, the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function is replaced with `tf.sparse.to_dense` and `tf.sparse.from_dense` to handle label sparsity. Additionally, the `ctc_loss` function is replaced with `tf.nn.ctc_loss` which provides more control over the inputs.

This corrected code should better handle the special case of batch size 1 and resolve the out of bounds error.
