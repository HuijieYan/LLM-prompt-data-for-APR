The error occurs in the ctc_batch_cost function, specifically when trying to use the tf.squeeze function on label_length and input_length. This results in an IndexError because the dimensions may not always be compatible with the squeeze operation.

To fix this bug, the tf.squeeze function needs to be replaced with tf.reshape to ensure that the dimensions are compatible. This will help avoid the IndexError and allow the function to work properly with batch_size = 1.

Here is the corrected code for the ctc_batch_cost function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.reshape(label_length, [-1])
    input_length = tf.reshape(input_length, [-1])
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(tf.nn.ctc_loss(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))

    return tf.expand_dims(sparse_labels, 1)
```

By using tf.reshape instead of tf.squeeze, we ensure that the dimensions are compatible and prevent the IndexError from occurring. This should resolve the issue with using online training (batch_size=1) in the ctc_batch_cost function.
