Potential Error Location:
Based on the error message, the issue seems to be related to the `label_length` variable. The error occurs when trying to access the index of the `label_length` variable.

Reason behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `label_length` is being squeezed and converted to a tensor of shape `(2,)`, but the original implementation expects a tensor of shape `(2, 1)`.

Possible Approaches to Fix the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `label_length` should be squeezed and expanded to the correct shape before being used in further computations.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
    y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
      containing the truth labels.
    y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
      containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
    input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
      each batch item in `y_pred`.
    label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
      each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
    Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
    CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.expand_dims(tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=-1), axis=-1)
    input_length = tf.expand_dims(tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=-1), axis=-1)
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.to_dense(tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)))
  
    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())
  
    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
