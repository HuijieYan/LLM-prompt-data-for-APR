# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
K.ctc_batch_cost() get slice index 0 of dimension 0 out of bounds error when using online trainning (batch_size=1)
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Hello, I am using CTC loss function in my model, everything were good until I tried to using online training (batch_size =1). The error was caused by K.ctc_batch_cost function.
The error can be reproduced with the keras example "image_ocr.py" by simply set the "minibatch_size = 1 " in line 446 ( the parameter of TextImagegenerator).

I am using keras 2.0.2 with tensorflow 1.1.0 backend.
Thank you!
```
