The error is likely caused by the `tf.squeeze` function, which removes dimensions of size 1 from the shape of a tensor. In the provided buggy function, it seems that the input tensors have shapes `(2, 1)` and `(1, 1)`, which are being squeezed to `(2,)` and `(1,)` respectively. This can lead to errors when trying to access elements in the tensor by index.

To fix the issue, we can modify the function to handle the input tensors with shapes `(2, 1)` and `(1, 1)` properly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.nn import ctc_label_dense_to_sparse

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.cast(tf.reshape(label_length, [-1]), dtype=tf.int32)
    input_length = tf.cast(tf.reshape(input_length, [-1]), dtype=tf.int32)
    sparse_labels = tf.cast(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length), dtype=tf.int32)

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + K.epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels, logits=y_pred, label_length=label_length, logit_length=input_length, logits_time_major=True), 1)

```

In the corrected code:
- We use `tf.cast` to convert the input_length and label_length tensors to int32, and we use `tf.reshape` to make sure they have a proper shape.
- We replace the `ctc.ctc_loss` function with `tf.nn.ctc_loss`, which is the updated function from TensorFlow for computing the CTC loss.

These modifications should address the issues with the original buggy function and prevent the "slice index out of bounds" error when using online training with a batch size of 1.
