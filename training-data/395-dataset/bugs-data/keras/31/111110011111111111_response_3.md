The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 788 in the "tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_shape.py" file. This error suggests that the index 0 is out of range for the dimension 0 of a tensor shape.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue might be arising from the usage of the "key" parameter for tensor shape indexing. It appears that the "key" used to access a dimension of the tensor shape is out of bounds.

The potential reason for this error could be that the function "ctc_batch_cost" is not handling the edge case of batch_size = 1 correctly, which is causing the tensor shapes to be accessed incorrectly.

To fix this issue, the "ctc_batch_cost" function should include a conditional check for the edge case of batch_size = 1 and handle it separately to ensure that the tensor shapes are accessed within bounds.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    if y_true.shape[0] == 1:
        return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                           labels=sparse_labels,
                                           sequence_length=input_length), 0)
    else:
        return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                           labels=sparse_labels,
                                           sequence_length=input_length), 1)
``` 

In the corrected function, an additional conditional check is included to handle the edge case of batch_size = 1. This ensures that the correct indexing is used for the tensor shapes, resolving the out of bounds error.
