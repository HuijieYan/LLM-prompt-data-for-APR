The error is likely occurring due to the use of `tf.squeeze()` on `label_length` and `input_length` without handling the case when the input tensor has shape `(1, )` which results in a scalar value after squeezing.

The bug is likely happening because the `tf.squeeze()` function is removing the dimension, and the subsequent operations are expecting a certain shape which is no longer present. This is likely causing the index out of bounds error.

To fix the bug, we should handle the case when `label_length` and `input_length` have a shape of `(1, )` and avoid squeezing in that case.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.cast(tf.reshape(label_length, [-1]), dtype=tf.int32)
    input_length = tf.cast(tf.reshape(input_length, [-1]), dtype=tf.int32)
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                         logits=y_pred,
                                         label_length=label_length,
                                         logit_length=input_length,
                                         blank_index=-1), axis=1)
```

In the corrected code, we handle the shape of `label_length` and `input_length` using `tf.reshape` and `tf.cast`. We also use `tf.sparse.from_dense` to create a sparse tensor from the dense true labels. Additionally, we use `tf.nn.ctc_loss` instead of `ctc.ctc_loss` for calculating the CTC loss.
