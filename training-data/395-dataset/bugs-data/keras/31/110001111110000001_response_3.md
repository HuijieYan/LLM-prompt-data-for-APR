The error message indicates that there is an issue with indexing the dimensions of the TensorShape object within the `tensor_shape.py` file in the TensorFlow backend.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))` within the `ctc_batch_cost` function.

The bug is occurring because the `label_length` variable is not being properly passed to the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function or it might not be sized correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `label_length` variable is correctly shaped and passed to the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. Additionally, we need to ensure that the input data (y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length) is correctly shaped and aligned with the expected input shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
