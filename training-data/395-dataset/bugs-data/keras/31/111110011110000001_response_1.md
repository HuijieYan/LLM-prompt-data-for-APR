The error message is indicating an `IndexError` in the `tensor_shape.py` file in the TensorFlow backend. This suggests that there is an issue with how the dimensions of the tensors are being handled within the `ctc_batch_cost` function. 

The potential error location within the `ctc_batch_cost` function is likely the line where the `sparse_labels` tensor is being initialized: 
```python
sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))
```

The error is likely caused by the dimensions of the `y_true` and `label_length` tensors not aligning properly, resulting in an index out of range error.

To fix this issue, the dimensions of the `y_true` tensor and the `label_length` tensor need to be explicitly handled to ensure that they are compatible for the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.

In the corrected function, the dimensions of the `y_true` and `label_length` tensors will be handled to ensure they are compatible for the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. Then, the corrected `ctc_batch_cost` function will be provided as the output.
