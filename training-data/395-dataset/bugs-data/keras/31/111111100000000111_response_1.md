Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the `ctc_batch_cost` function.

Reasons behind the Bug: The bug may be caused by the use of the `tf.squeeze()` function without specifying the `axis` parameter, which could lead to an incorrect operation.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the usage of `tf.squeeze()` and ensure that the correct `axis` parameter is specified.
2. Verify the input shapes and dimensions to ensure they are compatible with the operations being performed in the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.backend import ctc

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=-1))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=-1))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc.ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), axis=1)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `axis` parameter is added to the `tf.squeeze()` function calls to ensure correct operation.
2. The `epsilon()` function call is removed as it was not provided in the original code, and its purpose is not clear in this context.
