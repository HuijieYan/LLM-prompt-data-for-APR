The error message indicates that the issue is with the `ctc_batch_cost` function in the `keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py` file.

The error message specifically points to the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function within the `ctc_batch_cost` function, and it suggests that the issue might be related to indexing errors.

Upon analysis, the error most likely occurs because of incorrect indexing in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. The `label_length` variable seems to cause the issue, possibly due to not being correctly squeezed.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `label_length` variable is properly squeezed before being used in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. Additionally, we need to handle the indexing correctly to avoid the "list index out of range" error mentioned in the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=-1)  # Ensure label_length is properly squeezed
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=-1)  # Ensure input_length is properly squeezed
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))  # Remove the addition of epsilon()

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels, logits=y_pred, label_length=label_length, logits_length=input_length), 1)
```

This corrected code properly handles the squeezing of `label_length` and `input_length`, and uses the `tf.math.log` function to calculate the logarithm of the prediction. Additionally, it uses `tf.nn.ctc_loss` for the CTC loss calculation.
