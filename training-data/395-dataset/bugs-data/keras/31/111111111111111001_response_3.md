The error occurs in the function `ctc_batch_cost` in the file `keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py`. The error seems to be related to the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function or its usage inside `ctc_batch_cost`. The error message indicates an IndexError which is likely due to incorrect dimension indexing.

The potential error location is likely around the line where the `sparse_labels` are being computed using the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.

The issue is occurring because the `label_length` variable is being passed as a tensor of shape (2,). The `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function expects this to be a tensor with shape (samples,). It seems the direct conversion using `tf.squeeze` is not sufficient to handle the shape mismatch.

To fix this issue, the reshape function can be used to ensure that the `label_length` tensor matches the expected shape.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.reshape(label_length, [-1]))  # reshape to match expected shape
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.reshape(input_length, [-1]))  # reshape to match expected shape
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```
