The error message indicates that there is an issue with the dimensions of the input tensors within the `ctc_batch_cost` function. Specifically, the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function seems to be causing the problem by returning a TensorShape with empty dimensions, leading to an IndexError when trying to access these dimensions.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `sparse_labels` variable using the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. This function is not returning the expected shape for `sparse_labels`, which is causing the subsequent dimension access errors.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect handling of input tensor shapes within the `ctc_batch_cost` function. It seems that the function is not properly converting the input tensor shapes or the output of the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function to the expected formats.

To fix the bug, the input tensor shapes should be handled correctly, and the output of the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function should be checked for its shape before further processing. Additionally, any necessary reshaping or formatting of tensors should be performed to ensure compatibility with downstream operations.

Here is the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.cast(tf.squeeze(label_length), dtype=tf.int32)
    input_length = tf.cast(tf.squeeze(input_length), dtype=tf.int32)

    # Perform a shape check on the output of ctc_label_dense_to_sparse
    # to ensure it has the desired shape
    sparse_labels = ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)
    if len(sparse_labels.shape) == 1:
        sparse_labels = tf.expand_dims(sparse_labels, 1)
    elif len(sparse_labels.shape) == 2 and sparse_labels.shape[1] != 2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid shape for sparse_labels: " + str(sparse_labels.shape))

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                        logits=y_pred,
                                        label_length=label_length,
                                        logit_length=input_length,
                                        logits_time_major=True), 1)
```
In the corrected code, the input tensor shapes are correctly cast to int32 using `tf.cast`, and the output of `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` is checked for its shape, ensuring it has the form (batch_size, 2). Additionally, the `ctc.ctc_loss` function is replaced with `tf.nn.ctc_loss`, and the parameters are passed in a manner consistent with the TensorFlow documentation.
