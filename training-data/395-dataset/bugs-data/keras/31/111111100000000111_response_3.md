Potential error location: 
The error may be occurring when trying to access index 0 of the tensor at line 24, which could be causing an out of bounds error when using online training with a batch size of 1.

Reasons behind the bug: 
The bug may be caused by the assumption that the input_length and label_length tensors will always have more than one element. This assumption leads to an out of bounds error when accessing index 0 of these tensors with a batch size of 1.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the shape of the input_length and label_length tensors before accessing their values and handle the case when their shape is (1,).
2. Add a condition to check if the batch size is 1 and handle it separately to avoid the out of bounds error.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=-1))  # Ensure to squeeze along the correct axis
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=-1))  # Ensure to squeeze along the correct axis
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
