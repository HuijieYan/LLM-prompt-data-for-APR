The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" occurring in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function within the `ctc_batch_cost` function. This error seems to be related to the shape of the input data passed to the function.

Upon further analysis of the test case, it is clear that the test is intended to check the functionality of the `ctc_batch_cost` function, specifically for a `batch_size` of 1. The test case involves creating label and input data with a `batch_size` of 1, and then evaluating the `ctc_batch_cost` function with this data.

The error occurs in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function when it attempts to access the dimensions of the input data. The error message suggests that there is an issue with accessing the 0th dimension of the input data, which leads to the "list index out of range" error.

This error likely occurs because the shape of the input data is not being handled properly, potentially due to assumptions made about the shape of the data. When the `batch_size` is set to 1, the shape of the input data changes, and this is likely causing the error.

To fix the bug, it is important to handle the input data shape properly, particularly when the `batch_size` is 1. The code should account for the possibility of different input shapes based on the `batch_size`.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1)
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1)
    sparse_labels = ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels, inputs=y_pred, sequence_length=input_length, preprocess_collapse_repeated=False), 1)
```
In the corrected code:
1. The `tf.to_int32` function is replaced with `tf.squeeze` to handle the label_length and input_length tensors.
2. The `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function call does not need to cast to `tf.to_int32` since the function already handles the data types internally.
3. The `tf.log` function is replaced with `tf.math.log` for TensorFlow 2.x compatibility.
4. The `ctc.ctc_loss` call is replaced with `tf.nn.ctc_loss` to use the TensorFlow built-in function for CTC loss.

By making these changes, the function should now handle the input data properly, including cases where the `batch_size` is 1, and should resolve the "list index out of range" error.
