The error message indicates an IndexError in the `tensor_shape.py` file, specifically in the `__getitem__` method. This method is trying to access a list index that is out of range, resulting in the error.

The potential error location within the `ctc_batch_cost` function is the conversion of tensor shapes in the following lines:
```python
label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
```
It seems that the conversion of the tensor shapes to integers is not providing the expected shape, which leads to issues when using these values later in the function.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the tensor shapes are correctly converted to integers and the correct shape is maintained throughout the function. This may involve debugging the shape of the tensors at different stages of the function and ensuring that the operations being applied are appropriate for the tensor shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.nn.ctc_loss import ctc_loss
from tensorflow.nn.ctc_loss import ctc_label_dense_to_sparse

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    sparse_labels = ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + K.epsilon())

    return ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                    inputs=y_pred,
                    sequence_length=input_length,
                    preprocess_collapse_repeated=False,
                    ctc_merge_repeated=True)
```
In the corrected code, I removed the unnecessary conversions and used the appropriate functions from TensorFlow for CTC loss calculation. I also adjusted the format of the function arguments to match the expected inputs of the `ctc_loss` function. With these changes, the function should work as expected and eliminate the IndexError issue.
