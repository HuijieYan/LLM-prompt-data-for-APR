The error occurs when the `ctc_batch_cost` function is called. It seems there is an issue with TensorFlow functions and their expected input types.

The bug stems from the fact that some of the variables have a type of `RefVariable` instead of the expected `Tensor` type.

To fix this issue, the `tf.Variable` objects should be passed into TensorFlow functions to create tensors from these variables before using them in operations. Additionally, there are some typos in the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    epsilon = 1e-7  # Adding a small value to prevent NaN in the log operation
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
    sparse_labels = tf.io.encode_sparse(labels=y_true, lengths=label_length)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon)

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                         logits=y_pred,
                                         label_length=label_length,
                                         logit_length=input_length,
                                         logits_time_major=True), 1)
```

In this corrected code, I created a tensor from the `Label_length` and `Input_length` by using `tf.squeeze` and `tf.to_int32`. The `sparse_labels` are constructed using `tf.io.encode_sparse`, and the `log` function changed to `tf.math.log`. Finally, I used `tf.nn.ctc_loss` instead of `ctc.ctc_loss` for calculating the loss.
