The error seems to be related to the function `ctc_batch_cost` in the `keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py` file. It looks like the issue is happening when trying to convert the `label_length` tensor to an integer using `tf.squeeze` and `tf.to_int32`. 

The error message indicates an `IndexError` related to `self._dims[key]` when trying to access a dimension. This suggests that there might be an issue with the dimensions of the tensors being used.

The bug may have occurred due to incorrect tensor dimensions or indexing. It's possible that the shape of the tensor `label_length` or its dimension indices are causing the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we can consider checking the shape and dimension of the tensors `label_length` and `input_length` before performing `tf.squeeze` and `tf.to_int32`. It's crucial to ensure that the tensors have the expected shape and dimensions to avoid IndexError. Additionally, we should verify that the indexing operations are being performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops import ctc_ops as ctc

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.cast(tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1), dtype=tf.int32)
    input_length = tf.cast(tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1), dtype=tf.int32)
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true)
    
    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                       logits=y_pred,
                                       label_length=label_length,
                                       logit_length=input_length,
                                       logits_time_major=True),
                         axis=1)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `label_length` and `input_length` tensors are cast to integer using `tf.cast` after being squeezed to remove the unnecessary dimensions.
- The sparse representation of `y_true` is created using `tf.sparse.from_dense`.
- The `y_pred` is processed using `tf.math.log`.
- The `ctc.ctc_loss` function is used with the appropriate arguments to calculate the CTC loss.
