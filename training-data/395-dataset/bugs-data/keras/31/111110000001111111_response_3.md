The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the input_length and label_length variables being of type `<tf.Tensor>` instead of `<tf.Variable>`. 

This function is designed to handle tensors of type `<tf.Variable>`, but in the test case, they are of type `<tf.Tensor>`. This mismatch in types is causing the function to fail when it tries to access the dimensions of the input tensors.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle tensors of type `<tf.Tensor>` as well. This can be achieved by removing the unnecessary type conversions and ensuring that the input tensors are processed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]))

    return tf.expand_dims(tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                        logits=y_pred,
                                        label_length=tf.squeeze(label_length),
                                        logit_length=tf.squeeze(input_length),
                                        blank_index=-1), 1)
```

In the corrected code, the unnecessary type conversions have been removed, and the sparse labels are created using `tf.sparse.from_dense()` instead of `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse`. Additionally, `tf.nn.ctc_loss` is used instead of `ctc.ctc_loss`, and the input parameters are passed according to the correct function signature.
