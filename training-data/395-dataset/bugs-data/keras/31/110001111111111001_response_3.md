The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 788 in the tensorflow_backend.py file, which is caused by attempting to access an index that is not present in the list.

From the test, it can be inferred that the buggy function `ctc_batch_cost` is encountering an issue when processing label_length and input_length.

Upon inspecting the function, the potential error location seems to be in the line:
```python
label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
```
The issue likely arises from the `label_length` and `input_length` not having the expected dimensions when being squeezed or converted to integer.

The bug occurs because the dimensions of `label_length` and `input_length` are not compatible or do not match the expected dimensions during the squeezing or integer conversion process.

To fix the bug, ensure that the dimensions of `label_length` and `input_length` match the expected dimensions for squeezing and integer conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples,)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples,)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples, 1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
