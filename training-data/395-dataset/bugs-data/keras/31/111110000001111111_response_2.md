The bug in the provided function is likely in the line:
```python
sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))
```
As per the input parameter, label_length has shape (2, 1), and before the return, its shape is (2,), which is inconsistent with the expected shape of (2,). This indicates the possible bug since label_length should have the shape (2,) as per the inputs, but it is being reshaped to (2, 1).

The bug occurs because the label_length tensor is being squeezed to remove the dimension of size 1. However, the provided test case shows that the label_length has a shape of (2, 1) before the function is called. Therefore, the squeeze operation is not consistent with the provided input.

To fix the bug, the ctc_batch_cost function can be modified to handle the label_length tensor correctly without unnecessary reshaping.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    label_length = tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1)  # Remove the dimension of size 1
    input_length = tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1)  # Remove the dimension of size 1
    sparse_labels = tf.sparse.from_dense(y_true)  # Convert dense labels to sparse representation

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(
        tf.nn.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels, logits=y_pred, label_length=label_length, logit_length=input_length), 1)
```

In the corrected function, tf.sparse.from_dense is used to convert the dense y_true labels to a sparse representation. The label_length and input_length are squeezed to remove the unnecessary dimension of size 1. The ctc_loss function from tf.nn is used with the correct parameters to calculate the CTC loss.
