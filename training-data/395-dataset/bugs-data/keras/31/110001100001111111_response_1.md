The error is likely occurring within the `ctc_batch_cost` function due to the use of the `tf.squeeze` function. This function is being applied to the `label_length` and `input_length` tensors, which are of shape `(2, 1)` and `(1, 1)` respectively in the provided test cases. The `tf.squeeze` function is trying to remove dimensions of size 1 from the shape, but it seems to be causing issues with the shape of the tensors, leading to out-of-bounds errors.

The `tf.squeeze` function should be used carefully, as it may alter the shape of the tensors in a way that is not compatible with the subsequent operations.

To fix the bug, it's important to handle the tensor shapes properly. One approach could be to explicitly access the values from the `label_length` and `input_length` tensors using indexing, rather than using `tf.squeeze`. This can ensure that the shape of the tensors remains compatible with the subsequent operations.

Another approach could be to use the `tf.reshape` function to explicitly reshape the tensors to the desired shape, rather than relying on squeezing out dimensions of size 1.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```

In the corrected code, the use of `tf.squeeze` has been removed, and the tensors `label_length` and `input_length` are used directly without modifying their shapes. This should prevent the out-of-bounds errors and provide the expected output.
