The error message indicates an IndexError when attempting to index a TensorShape object in the `tensorflow/python/framework/tensor_shape.py` file.

The bug lies in the `sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))` line in the `ctc_batch_cost` function. This is because the `label_length` tensor is being passed as a TensorFlow Variable, and this is leading to an index out of range error.

The issue occurs because the `label_length` value is expected to be a tensor with shape `(samples, 1)`, but it is being passed as a TensorFlow Variable of shape `(2, 1)` in the test case. This causes a mismatch and results in the error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to ensure that `label_length` is passed as a tensor and not a TensorFlow Variable. One way to achieve this is to use `K.constant(label_length)` to convert the `label_length` variable to a constant tensor before passing it to the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length))
    label_length = K.constant(label_length)  # Convert label_length to a tensor
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
