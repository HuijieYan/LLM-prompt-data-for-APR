The error in the `ctc_batch_cost` function seems to be caused by the use of the `label_length` variable in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the index 0 of dimension 0 being out of bounds. This might be related to how the `label_length` is being used to index a tensor dimension.

The bug occurs because the `label_length` is being squeezed without providing the `axis` parameter. This may lead to the dimensions being reduced incorrectly and causing the index out of bounds error when used in the `ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` function.

To fix the bug, the `squeeze` function should be updated to provide the `axis` parameter to ensure that the squeeze operation is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `ctc_batch_cost` function:

```python
def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    label_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(label_length, axis=1))
    input_length = tf.to_int32(tf.squeeze(input_length, axis=1))
    sparse_labels = tf.to_int32(ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length))

    y_pred = tf.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(inputs=y_pred,
                                       labels=sparse_labels,
                                       sequence_length=input_length), 1)
```

The `squeeze` function now specifies the `axis` parameter as 1 to ensure that the squeeze operation is performed along the correct axis, preventing the index out of bounds error.
