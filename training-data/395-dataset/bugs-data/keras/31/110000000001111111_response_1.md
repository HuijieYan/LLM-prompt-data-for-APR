The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of `label_length` and `input_length` to int32 using `tf.squeeze` and `tf.to_int32`. The bug may have occurred due to the mismatch in the dimensions of the input tensors. The conversion to int32 without considering the batch dimension may have caused the function to return incorrect results or throw an error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the dimensions of the tensors are handled correctly and consistently throughout the function. We also need to handle the sparse_labels and y_pred tensors properly to avoid any potential indexing out of bounds errors.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops import ctc_ops as ctc

def ctc_batch_cost(y_true, y_pred, input_length, label_length):
    """Runs CTC loss algorithm on each batch element.

    # Arguments
        y_true: tensor `(samples, max_string_length)`
            containing the truth labels.
        y_pred: tensor `(samples, time_steps, num_categories)`
            containing the prediction, or output of the softmax.
        input_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_pred`.
        label_length: tensor `(samples, 1)` containing the sequence length for
            each batch item in `y_true`.

    # Returns
        Tensor with shape (samples,1) containing the
            CTC loss of each element.
    """
    sparse_labels = ctc.ctc_label_dense_to_sparse(y_true, label_length)

    y_pred = tf.math.log(tf.transpose(y_pred, perm=[1, 0, 2]) + tf.keras.backend.epsilon())

    return tf.expand_dims(ctc.ctc_loss(labels=sparse_labels,
                                       inputs=y_pred,
                                       sequence_length=input_length,
                                       preprocess_collapse_repeated=False), 1)
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `ctc.ctc_label_dense_to_sparse` directly to get the `sparse_labels` without unnecessary type conversions.
- `tf.math.log` is used instead of `tf.log` to take the logarithm of the `y_pred` tensor.
- The parameters for the `ctc.ctc_loss` function are reordered and `preprocess_collapse_repeated` parameter is added to avoid out of bounds error.

This corrected code should address the issues with the original buggy function and handle the input tensors properly.
