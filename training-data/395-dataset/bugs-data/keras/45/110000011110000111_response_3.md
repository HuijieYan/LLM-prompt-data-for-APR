Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the line `raise ValueError("None values not supported.")` inside the `make_tensor_proto` function of the Tensorflow framework.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error message suggests that there is an attempt to pass a `None` value at a point where it is not supported. This means that within the `call` function provided, there might be a missing value or some issue related to the nature of input values that are not supported.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the input parameters being passed to the `call` function and ensure they are not `None`.
2. Ensure that the input parameters are compatible with the operations being performed within the `call` function.
3. Check for any missing values or parameters that might be causing the issue and make necessary corrections.

Corrected Code for the `call` function:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # Rest of the function code remains the same

    # Previous code
    # ...
    # if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
    #     if training is None:
    #         h._uses_learning_phase = True
    # return h, [h, c]

    # Updated code
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is not None:
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    return h, [h, c]
```
