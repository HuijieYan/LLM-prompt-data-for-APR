Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is with the conditional statement `if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:`. This statement is meant to check if either `self.dropout` or `self.recurrent_dropout` is greater than 0, but it is currently adding them together, which is not the intended behavior.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional statement is incorrectly checking the sum of `self.dropout` and `self.recurrent_dropout`, rather than checking each one individually.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statement to check if either `self.dropout` or `self.recurrent_dropout` is greater than 0. We can use the logical OR (`or`) operator for this purpose.

Corrected Code:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # existing code...

    h = o * self.activation(c)
    if 0 < self.dropout or 0 < self.recurrent_dropout:  # Modified conditional statement
        if training is None:
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    return h, [h, c]
```
