The error message indicates that the problematic function is encountering an issue with `None` values not being supported. This is likely due to `None` being passed as a parameter to the function.

The potential error location within the `call` method is in the line `if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:` where `self.dropout` or `self.recurrent_dropout` might be `None`.

It appears that `self.dropout` or `self.recurrent_dropout` are not being properly initialized, leading to the `None` values being passed as parameters. This could be due to an incorrect initialization or missing assignment.

A possible approach to fix the bug would be to ensure that `self.dropout` and `self.recurrent_dropout` are properly initialized and assigned with a default value in the constructor of the class where `call` method is defined.

Here's the corrected code for the `call` method:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    if self.dropout is None:
        self.dropout = 0.0
    if self.recurrent_dropout is None:
        self.recurrent_dropout = 0.0
    
    # rest of the code remains the same
```
