The error seems to be originating from the `make_tensor_proto` function, which is being triggered by the `call` method within the `LSTMCell` class. Specifically, the error is caused by passing `None` values into the `make_tensor_proto` function, which is not supported.

The potential error in the `LSTMCell` class is that the `call` method is not handling the case where `inputs` or `h` might be `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for `None` values before performing any operations on `inputs` and `h`. If either `inputs` or `h` is `None`, we should return `None` from the `call` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `LSTMCell` class with the fixed `call` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class LSTMCell(Layer):
    """
    Cell class for the LSTM layer.
    
    # Arguments
    # ... (other arguments)
    """

    # ... (other methods)

    # Updated call method to handle None inputs
    def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
        if inputs is None or states[0] is None or states[1] is None:
            return None, states # Return None if inputs or h is None

        # rest of the code
```

With this fix, the `call` method will handle the case where `inputs` or `h` may be `None`, and it will return `None` in such cases to prevent triggering the `make_tensor_proto` error.
