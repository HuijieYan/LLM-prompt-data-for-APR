Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring within the `make_tensor_proto` function of TensorFlow, which is being called by the `call` method of the `LSTMCell` class.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The error message indicates that the `values` parameter being passed to the `make_tensor_proto` function is None. This could be due to the fact that the `call` method is not returning a proper value or is returning a None value, leading to an error when `make_tensor_proto` function is used.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `call` method of the `LSTMCell` class returns a valid value instead of None.
2. Check for any logical errors within the `call` method that could cause it to return None.
3. If the `call` method is intended to return None in certain cases, handle this scenario properly to avoid errors when `make_tensor_proto` is called.

Corrected Code for the `call` Method:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # ... previous code ...

    h = o * self.activation(c)
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is None:
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    return h, [h, c]
```
