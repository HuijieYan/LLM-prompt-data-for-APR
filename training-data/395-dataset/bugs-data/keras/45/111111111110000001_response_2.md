The error message is indicating that there is an issue with passing None values, which is not supported. This error is likely occurring due to the fact that the 'call' function is returning a 'None' value.

Looking at the 'call' function provided, it seems that there is a missing return value in the form of a 'None' value, which is causing the error.

To fix this issue, the 'call' function should return a valid tensor value instead of 'None'. This can be achieved by ensuring that the computations within the 'call' function result in a tensor output.

Here's the corrected code for the 'call' function:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    h = o * self.activation(c)
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is None:
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    
    # Return the computed output as a tensor
    return h
```

By returning the computed output 'h' as a tensor, the issue related to returning 'None' values should be resolved.
