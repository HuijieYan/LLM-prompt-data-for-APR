The potential error in the `call` method of the `LSTMCell` class is that it is not handling the `None` value of the `training` argument properly. It's trying to access the `_uses_learning_phase` attribute of `h` without checking if `h` is `None` or not.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `h` is not `None` before accessing its attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `call` method:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # ... (previous code)

    h = o * self.activation(c)
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is not None:  # Check if training is not None
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    return h, [h, c]
```
