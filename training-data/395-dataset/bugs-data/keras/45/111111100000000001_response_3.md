The potential location of the error in the `call` method is that it appears to be taking in a parameter `states`, but is not defined or used anywhere within the function. This could lead to potential issues when calling the function or misinterpreting its purpose.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `states` parameter is defined in the function signature but is not used within the function body. This could lead to confusion for users of the function and potentially unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `states` parameter should be utilized within the function body. Otherwise, it should be removed from the function signature if it is not necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the `call` method:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # dropout matrices for input units
    dp_mask = self._dropout_mask
    # dropout matrices for recurrent units
    rec_dp_mask = self._recurrent_dropout_mask

    # rest of the function body remains the same
    # ...

    h = o * self.activation(c)
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is None:
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    return h, [h, c, states]  # include states in the returned result
```
