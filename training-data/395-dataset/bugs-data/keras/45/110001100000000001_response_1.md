The given code seems to be a part of a recurrent neural network implementation, specifically the call function of a recurrent layer. 

The error in the provided code is that the call method is being defined multiple times with the same signature, which is not allowed in Python. It looks like there are multiple duplicate definitions of the same functions within the file, which is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate definitions of the functions and keep only one definition for each function.

The corrected code for the problematic function 'call' would look like this:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # ... function implementation ...
    pass
```

It's important to make sure that there is only one definition of each function within the file to avoid any conflicts and errors.
