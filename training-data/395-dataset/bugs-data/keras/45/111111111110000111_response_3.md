The error message indicates that there is an issue with handling None values within the `make_tensor_proto` function of the TensorFlow library. This means that somewhere within the code, None values are being used when they are not supported.

The potential error location within the provided function is when the `call` method is returning the output `h` or the states `[h, c]` with possible None values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `h` or `c` values might be None at certain points during the execution of the function.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that `h` and `c` are not None before returning them. This can be achieved by implementing a check for None values and providing default values when necessary.

The corrected code for the `call` method is as follows:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # ... (previously existing code)

    # existing code here ...

    h = o * self.activation(c)
    if 0 < self.dropout + self.recurrent_dropout:
        if training is None:
            h._uses_learning_phase = True
    
    # Fix for handling possible None values
    if h is None:
        h = K.zeros_like(c)
    if c is None:
        c = K.zeros_like(h)

    return h, [h, c]
``` 

With this fix, the code checks for potential None values for both `h` and `c`, and if they are found to be None, it replaces them with zero tensors. This ensures that the `make_tensor_proto` function in the TensorFlow library does not encounter None values and avoids the ValueError caused by attempting to handle None values.
