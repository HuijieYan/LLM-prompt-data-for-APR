The potential error in the code is that the function call() is trying to access properties like self.implementation, self.dropout, self.recurrent_dropout, etc., but these properties are not defined in the code provided. This will result in a NameError as these properties are not defined anywhere in the code.

To fix this issue, the properties like self.implementation, self.dropout, self.recurrent_dropout, self.kernel, self.recurrent_kernel, self.bias, self.units, self.activation, self.recurrent_activation, and self.use_bias need to be defined somewhere in the class where the call() function is located.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # assuming the properties are defined, continue with the rest of the function
    pass
```

Since the properties are not defined in the provided code snippet, the corrected code cannot be accurately provided. The corrected code would depend on the actual implementation of these properties and their usage within the call() function.
