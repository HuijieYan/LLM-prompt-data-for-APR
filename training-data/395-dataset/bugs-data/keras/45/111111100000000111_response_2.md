Upon analyzing the given code, it seems that the buggy function is the `call` method within the `LSTMCell` class. The error is occurring due to the incorrect handling of the input arguments and attributes within the function.

The bug is likely occurring because the function parameters are not being used correctly. The `call` method is expected to take `inputs` and `states` as inputs, but within the function, there are unused parameters such as `training` and attributes such as `self.implementation`.

To fix the bug, we should remove the unused `training` parameter and the attributes such as `self.implementation`. Additionally, we should ensure that the `inputs` and `states` are used correctly within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `call` method within the `LSTMCell` class:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states):
    # dropout matrices for input units
    dp_mask = self._dropout_mask
    # dropout matrices for recurrent units
    rec_dp_mask = self._recurrent_dropout_mask

    h_tm1 = states[0]  # previous memory state
    c_tm1 = states[1]  # previous carry state

    if 0 < self.dropout < 1.:
        inputs_i = inputs * dp_mask[0]
        inputs_f = inputs * dp_mask[1]
        inputs_c = inputs * dp_mask[2]
        inputs_o = inputs * dp_mask[3]
    else:
        inputs_i = inputs
        inputs_f = inputs
        inputs_c = inputs
        inputs_o = inputs
    x_i = K.dot(inputs_i, self.kernel_i) + self.bias_i
    # ... rest of the code ...

    h = o * self.activation(c)
    return h, [h, c]
```

In this corrected code, the `training` parameter has been removed, and the `inputs` and `states` parameters are used correctly within the function.
