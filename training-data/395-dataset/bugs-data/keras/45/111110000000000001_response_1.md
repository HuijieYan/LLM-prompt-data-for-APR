The potential error in the given code is the use of uninitialized variables `self._dropout_mask` and `self._recurrent_dropout_mask`, which are being used to calculate `dp_mask` and `rec_dp_mask` in the `call` method. This results in a "NameError" when the `call` method is called.

To fix this bug, we need to initialize `self._dropout_mask` and `self._recurrent_dropout_mask` with the appropriate dropout matrices before the `call` method is called.

The corrected code for the `call` method is as follows:

```python
def call(self, inputs, states, training=None):
    # initialize dropout and recurrent_dropout masks
    if 0. < self.dropout < 1.:
        dp_mask = self._dropout_mask
    if 0. < self.recurrent_dropout < 1.:
        rec_dp_mask = self._recurrent_dropout_mask

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    h_tm1 = states[0]  # previous memory state
    c_tm1 = states[1]  # previous carry state
    # ... (rest of the code)
```
