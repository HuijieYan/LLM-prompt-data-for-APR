The potential error in the given code is the use of `self.filter_sk_params` method, which is not a standard method in the context of the provided code. This is causing the function to throw an error.

The bug occurred because the `self.filter_sk_params` method is not a standard method in the context of the provided code. It seems that the intention was to filter out only the keyword arguments relevant to the `Sequential.predict` method, but this is not the correct way to achieve that.

To fix the bug, we can remove the use of `self.filter_sk_params` and directly pass the `kwargs` to the `self.model.predict` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
