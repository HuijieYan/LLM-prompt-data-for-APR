The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the handling of the `kwargs` dictionary within the `predict` method. The current implementation attempts to filter the dictionary `kwargs` using a method `filter_sk_params` that is not defined within the given code. This is likely causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we can directly pass the `kwargs` dictionary to the `predict` method of the `Sequential` model without attempting to filter it.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

With this correction, the `kwargs` dictionary will be directly passed to the `predict` method of the `Sequential` model without any unnecessary filtering and the bug should be resolved.
