The error is occurring because the `predict` method returns a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input shape is (1, num_features).

The issue is likely within the following lines of the `predict` method:
```python
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

When the `x` input has a shape of (1, num_features), the prediction should be returned as a 1-dimensional array to match the shape of the input.

To fix this bug, the `np.squeeze` call should be removed and the returned prediction should be left unchanged. This will maintain the correct shape of the prediction as per the shape of the input.

The corrected `predict` method is as follows:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
