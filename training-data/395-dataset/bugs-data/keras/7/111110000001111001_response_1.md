The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)`. This line is attempting to call the method `filter_sk_params` on the `self` object, but it is not correctly referencing the method.

The bug is occurring because the `filter_sk_params` method is not a method of the `self` object, and it is not being called correctly. The `filter_sk_params` method should be called with the class name `KerasRegressor` instead of the method `Sequential.predict`.

To fix the bug, the `filter_sk_params` method should be called on the class itself rather than on the `self` object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(KerasRegressor.predict, kwargs)
        return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))

```
