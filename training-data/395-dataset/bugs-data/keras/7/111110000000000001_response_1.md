Potential error location: The line "kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)" seems to be causing the bug as it is trying to call "Sequential.predict" without instantiating an object of the Sequential class.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the "Sequential.predict" function is being called without creating an instance of the Sequential class, leading to a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The "Sequential.predict" function should be called on an instance of the Sequential class, and the input arguments should be properly filtered before passing them to the "model.predict" function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `model.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.model.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
