Potential error location:
The line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` seems to be the potential error location.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `filter_sk_params` method is being called with the class method `Sequential.predict` as an argument, which is not a valid input for `filter_sk_params`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Instead of passing `Sequential.predict` as an argument to `filter_sk_params`, we should pass the method of the current class, which is `self.model.predict`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
