Potential error location:
The potential error in the provided function is the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)`. This line seems to be attempting to filter the keyword arguments using some method `filter_sk_params` that is not defined within the function.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the `filter_sk_params` method is not a standard method or a method defined within the provided function. It seems that the intention was to filter the keyword arguments, but the implementation is incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to use the standard Python method for filtering dictionary keyword arguments, such as `filter` or a custom method defined within the class.

Corrected code:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    filtered_kwargs = {key: value for key, value in kwargs.items() if key in self.model.predict.__code__.co_varnames}
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **filtered_kwargs))
```
