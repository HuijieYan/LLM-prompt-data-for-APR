The bug is likely in the predict function within the KerasRegressor class. The error message from the test function indicates that the shape of the predictions is incorrect.

The issue is likely that the filter_sk_params function is not being called correctly, and it is not properly handling the 'batch_size' parameter in the kwargs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the predict function to correctly handle the 'batch_size' parameter and pass it to the model's predict method.

Here's the corrected code for the predict function:

```python
import numpy as np

class KerasRegressor:
    # ... (other methods)

    def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.

        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        if 'batch_size' in kwargs:
            batch_size = kwargs.pop('batch_size')
        else:
            batch_size = None

        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
        
        if batch_size:
            return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, batch_size=batch_size, **kwargs))
        else:
            return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'batch_size' parameter is present in the kwargs. If it is, we pop it from the kwargs and store the value. Then, we use the 'filter_sk_params' function to handle any other parameters properly. Finally, we call the model's predict method, passing the stored batch_size and any remaining kwargs. This should address the issue and ensure that the predictions have the correct shape.
