Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`. This is most likely causing the output to be a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input has shape (1, num_features).

Reason for the bug:
The `np.squeeze()` function is removing the singleton dimension, causing the output to be a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Instead of using `np.squeeze()`, we can use indexing to ensure that the output is always a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input has shape (1, num_features).

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)[:, 0]
```
