The error is occurring at the `assert_regression_predict_shape_correct` test function, where it checks if the shape of the predictions is correct. The error message shows that the actual shape of the prediction is `()` instead of `(1,)`, which indicates that there is an issue with squashing the size-1 batch dimension.

The problem is occurring in the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. When the method returns the prediction, it should maintain the dimensions of the input but it is currently squashing the size-1 batch dimension.

To fix the bug, the following corrected `predict` method should be used:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if preds.shape[1] == 1:
        preds = np.squeeze(preds, axis=1)
    return preds
```

In the corrected method, after obtaining the predictions `preds`, it checks if the shape of the predictions corresponds to a size-1 batch dimension. If it does, it uses `np.squeeze` to remove the size-1 dimension.

This correction ensures that the predictions maintain the correct shape and do not squash the size-1 batch dimension, resolving the issue where the shape of the prediction was incorrectly transformed to `()`.
