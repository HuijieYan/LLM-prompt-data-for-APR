Potential Error location:
The error is occurring in the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` as it is trying to call the `filter_sk_params` method on the class instance (`self`), but the `filter_sk_params` method does not exist in the current class.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug:
The `filter_sk_params` method is not defined within the class, so calling it using `self` will result in an AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If the `filter_sk_params` method is supposed to be a classmethod, then it should be defined as such within the class.
2. If `filter_sk_params` is not supposed to be part of the class, it should be removed from the function and replaced with the correct logic to filter the kwargs.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_7/keras/wrappers/scikit_learn.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
