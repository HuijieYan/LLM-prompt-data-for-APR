Potential error location: 
The issue is with the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)`. It seems the intention is to filter the kwargs based on the arguments of `Sequential.predict`, but the `filter_sk_params` method is being used incorrectly.

Reason for the bug:
The `filter_sk_params` method is not being used correctly. It seems that the intention is to filter the `kwargs` dictionary based on the arguments that `Sequential.predict` accepts, but the method is not implemented in a way that accomplishes this effectively.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use reflection to get the parameters of the `Sequential.predict` method and filter the `kwargs` dictionary based on those parameters.
2. Alternatively, if the intention is to only pass valid arguments to `self.model.predict`, then the code should be modified to directly filter the `kwargs` dictionary based on the valid arguments of `self.model.predict`.

Corrected code:

```python
import inspect

def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    valid_args = inspect.getargspec(self.model.predict).args  # Get valid arguments for self.model.predict
    filtered_kwargs = {k: v for k, v in kwargs.items() if k in valid_args}  # Filter kwargs based on valid_args
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **filtered_kwargs))
```
