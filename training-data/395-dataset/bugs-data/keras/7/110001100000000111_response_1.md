The error seems to occur when the `predict` function is called on input with shape (1, num_features), resulting in the output being a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the bug is occurring in the `predict` function in the provided code. The issue stems from the line:
```python
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
The `np.squeeze` function is causing the output to be a 0-dimensional array when it should be a 1-dimensional array.

To fix this bug, the `np.squeeze` function should be removed and instead, the output directly returned from `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

This corrected code will ensure that the output of the `predict` function is a 1-dimensional array as expected.
