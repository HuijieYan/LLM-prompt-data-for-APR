Potential error location:
The issue is likely due to the np.squeeze() function used in the predict() method. When the input has a shape of (1, num_features), np.squeeze() removes the single dimension, resulting in a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because np.squeeze() removes single-dimensional entries from the shape of the given array, leading to incorrect shape transformation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fixing the bug is to remove the np.squeeze() function and ensure that the return value is always a 1-dimensional array with 1 element, as expected by the test case.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """
    Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
