# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Scikit Learn wrapper predict() inappropriately squashes size-1 batch dimension
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Please make sure that the boxes below are checked before you submit your issue.
If your issue is an implementation question, please ask your question on StackOverflow or on the Keras Slack channel instead of opening a GitHub issue.

Thank you!

 Check that you are up-to-date with the master branch of Keras. You can update with:
pip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git --upgrade --no-deps
Using Keras version 2.2.4

 Check that your version of TensorFlow is up-to-date. The installation instructions can be found here.
Using Tensorflow version 1.12.0

 Provide a link to a GitHub Gist of a Python script that can reproduce your issue (or just copy the script here if it is short).

If predict() is called on input with shape (1, num_features), then the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

import keras
import keras.wrappers.scikit_learn
import numpy as np
import sklearn.linear_model
import sklearn.metrics

def build_net():
    model = keras.models.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_dim=2)])
    model.compile(loss=keras.losses.mean_squared_error, optimizer="sgd")
    return model

regressor = keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasRegressor(build_fn=build_net)
# Works with the sklearn regressors
# regressor = sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()
X = np.zeros((1, 2))
Y = np.zeros((1,))
regressor.fit(X, Y)
Y_pred = regressor.predict(X)
print(Y_pred.shape)  # Is (), should be (1,)
# As a result, this fails with an exception
# TypeError: Singleton array array(0., dtype=float32) cannot be considered a valid collection.
print(sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error(y_true=Y, y_pred=Y_pred))
```



# Instructions

1. Analyze the test case and its relationship with the error message, if applicable.
2. Identify the potential error location within the problematic function.
3. Explain the reasons behind the occurrence of the bug.
4. Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the problematic function.
