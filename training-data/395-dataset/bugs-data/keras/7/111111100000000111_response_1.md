Potential error location:
The line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))` could be the potential location of the error, as it is trying to squeeze the output, which may be causing the issue with the size-1 batch dimension.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is using `np.squeeze` to remove the size-1 batch dimension, which results in a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Instead of using `np.squeeze`, we can use `np.atleast_1d` to ensure that the output is at least 1-dimensional.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    return np.atleast_1d(preds)
```
