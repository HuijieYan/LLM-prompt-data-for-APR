From the error message, it is clear that the issue is with the shape of the predictions generated by the `predict` method. The specific assertion `assert preds.shape == (num_test, )` fails with the error `assert () == (1,)`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))` where it seems that it is converting the array shape to a 0-dimensional array instead of preserving the shape.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `np.squeeze` function is being used without considering the input shape properly, which is causing the shape to be altered inappropriately.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to remove the unnecessary use of `np.squeeze` and to return the prediction array as is.

Below is the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
