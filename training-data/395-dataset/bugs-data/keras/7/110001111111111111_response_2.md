The error is likely occurring when the predict() function is called on input with shape (1, num_features), as indicated by the error message.

The potential error location is the following line in the predict() function:
```python
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
Here, np.squeeze() function is used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. It may be causing the issue when the input shape is (1, num_features).

The bug occurs because the np.squeeze() function is squashing the size-1 batch dimension, which leads to an incorrect shape.

To fix the bug, we can modify the predict() function to handle the case where the input has a shape of (1, num_features) differently and ensure that the output has the correct dimensions.

Here's the corrected code for the predict() function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    predictions = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    
    # Handle the case where input has a shape of (1, num_features)
    if predictions.shape[1] == 1:
        predictions = np.squeeze(predictions, axis=1)
        
    return predictions
```
With this modification, the predict() function will now correctly handle the case where the input has a shape of (1, num_features) and ensure that the output has the correct dimensions.
