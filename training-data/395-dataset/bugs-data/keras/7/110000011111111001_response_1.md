The error message indicates that the shape of the predictions (`preds`) is not as expected. The test expects the shape to be `(1,)`, but the actual shape is `()`, which means the predictions are not returning a valid shape. This discrepancy indicates a potential issue with the `predict` function.

The potential error location within the `predict` function is the line:
```python
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `**kwargs` dictionary is not being handled properly and is not being passed to the `self.model.predict` function correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `predict` function to correctly pass the `kwargs` to the `self.model.predict` function. The corrected code for the `predict` function is as follows:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs if kwargs else {}))
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that if `kwargs` is empty, we pass an empty dictionary to `self.model.predict` to avoid any unexpected behavior. This change should fix the bug and align the output with the expected result.
