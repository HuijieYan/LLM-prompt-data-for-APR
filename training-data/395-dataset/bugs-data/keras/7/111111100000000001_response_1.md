Potential error location: 
The error is occurring in the line "kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)" where the function "filter_sk_params" is being called with an incorrect argument "Sequential.predict". It seems like the intention was to call the function "filter_sk_params" from within the class using the "self" parameter.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug occurred because the "filter_sk_params" function is being called incorrectly. It seems like the original code intended to use the "self" parameter to call the function within the class, but instead used "Sequential.predict" directly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to call the "filter_sk_params" function correctly by using the "self" parameter to call it within the class.

Corrected code:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)  # Call the function using "self" parameter
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
