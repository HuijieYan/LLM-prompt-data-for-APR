The error message indicates that there is a shape mismatch in the predictions returned by the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. When the method is called on input with shape (1, num_features), the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element, causing the assertion to fail.

The potential error location within the `predict` method is likely related to the `np.squeeze` call. The `np.squeeze` function removes single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. It is used to remove dimensions of size 1, which is causing the issue in this case.

The bug occurs because the `np.squeeze` call is inadvertently removing the size-1 batch dimension, leading to the incorrect shape in the predictions.

To fix the bug, the `np.squeeze` call needs to be replaced with code that handles the shape of the predictions correctly. Instead of using `np.squeeze`, we can ensure that the predictions have the correct shape by checking the shape of the prediction array and handling the size-1 batch dimension appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    predictions = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    
    if len(predictions.shape) == 1:
        # If predictions are 1-dimensional, reshape to add a batch dimension
        return predictions.reshape(-1, 1)
    else:
        return predictions
```

In this corrected code, the `predictions` array is reshaped to add a batch dimension if it is 1-dimensional. This ensures that the output predictions maintain the correct shape and avoid removing the size-1 batch dimension.
