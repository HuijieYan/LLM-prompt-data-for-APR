The potential error in the `predict` function is that the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` is trying to call the `filter_sk_params` method of the `BaseWrapper` class, but the `BaseWrapper` class is not defined in the given code snippet. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `filter_sk_params` method is being called on an undefined class, which will result in an error.
To fix this bug, we need to define the `BaseWrapper` class or use an already existing class with the `filter_sk_params` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
