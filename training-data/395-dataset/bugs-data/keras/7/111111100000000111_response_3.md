The test case provided demonstrates that when the `predict` method is called on input with shape (1, num_features), the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. This is causing an exception to be thrown when using `sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error`.

The potential error location within the `predict` method is the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))`. The `np.squeeze` function is being used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of the array, causing the output to become a 0-dimensional array when it should be a 1-dimensional array.

The bug occurs because the `np.squeeze` function is being used to eliminate the size-1 batch dimension, but this is not the correct behavior. The size-1 batch dimension needs to be handled differently to ensure that the output remains a 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

To fix the bug, the code for the `predict` method can be updated as follows:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
        return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

By removing the `np.squeeze` function, the bug can be fixed. After making this change, the test case provided should produce the expected output of `Y_pred.shape = (1,)` and avoid the exception when using `sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error`.
