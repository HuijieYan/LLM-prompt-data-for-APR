The error occurs in the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. The `assert_regression_predict_shape_correct` test method checks the shape of the predictions made by the `predict` method and finds that it does not match the expected shape.

The bug in the `predict` method is due to the incorrect usage of the `filter_sk_params` method. The method is being called on `Sequential.predict`, which is not equivalent to `self.predict`. This is causing the `kwargs` to not be properly filtered, leading to incorrect predictions.

To fix this, we need to use the `filter_sk_params` method correctly to filter the kwargs for the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. Additionally, we need to ensure that the shape of the predictions matches the expected shape.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
import numpy as np

class KerasRegressor:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
    
    def filter_sk_params(self, fn, override=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
    
    def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)  # Correct usage of filter_sk_params
        preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
        if preds.shape[0] == 1:
            preds = preds.flatten()
        return preds
```
