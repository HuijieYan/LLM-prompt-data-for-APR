The error message indicates that the `assert_regression_predict_shape_correct` function is failing because the `preds` shape is not matching the expected shape of `(1,)`.

The potential error location within the `predict` function is the line:
```
kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `kwargs` dictionary is being modified, which is causing the `predict` function to return an empty tuple, leading to the failure in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `kwargs` dictionary is properly passed to the `model.predict` function without any modification.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
