The bug occurs when the predict() function is called on input with shape (1, num_features), as the output is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. This causes issues when using scikit-learn metrics such as mean_squared_error.

The potential error in the predict() function is with np.squeeze(). The np.squeeze() function removes single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. When a single sample is fed into the model, np.squeeze() is reducing the array shape from (1,) to (), which causes issues downstream in calculations.

To fix the bug, we should remove the call to np.squeeze() and modify the code to ensure that the output shape is correct for both single samples and multiple samples.

```python
import numpy as np

def filter_sk_params(self, fn, override=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
    x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
    Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
    and `n_features` is the number of features.
    **kwargs: dictionary arguments
    Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
    preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
    Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

By removing the call to np.squeeze(), the predict() function will return predictions with the correct shape, ensuring compatibility with scikit-learn metrics for both single samples and multiple samples.
