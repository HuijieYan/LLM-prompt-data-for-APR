Potential Error Location:
The error occurs in the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` where `Sequential.predict` should be represented with `self.predict`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `filter_sk_params` method is being called incorrectly. It should be called on the instance of the class, rather than on the class itself (`Sequential`). This is leading to a NameError as `Sequential` is not defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Change the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)` to `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)
        return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
