Potential error location:
The error is likely to be in the line `kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)`. It seems like the intention is to filter the sklearn parameters, but there is no reference to `Sequential.predict` and no `self` reference to the `filter_sk_params` function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `filter_sk_params` is being called incorrectly and there is no reference to `Sequential.predict`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The function `filter_sk_params` should be called using the correct syntax and referencing `self`, and `Sequential.predict` should be passed as a parameter to this function.
2. Check if the `filter_sk_params` function is actually needed for this `predict` method and if it is relevant to the scope of this method.

Corrected code:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
