The bug seems to be in the predict function of the KerasRegressor class. The shape of the predictions is incorrect, resulting in a failed assertion error in the test.

The issue is likely occurring because np.squeeze is returning an empty array instead of an array with shape (1,). This is happening because np.squeeze removes axes with length 1, and in this case, it's removing the only axis and leaving the array empty.

To fix this, we can modify the predict function to handle the case where the predictions have shape (1,) differently. We can check if the shape is (1,) and then reshape it to (1,). This will ensure that the shape of the prediction matches the expected shape, fixing the assertion error in the test.

Here's the corrected code for the predict function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    predictions = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if predictions.shape == (1,):  # Handle the case where predictions have shape (1,)
        return predictions.reshape(1, 1)
    else:
        return np.squeeze(predictions)
```

With this modification, the predict function will handle the case where the predictions have shape (1,) correctly, ensuring that it returns an array with shape (1,) instead of an empty array. This should resolve the assertion error in the test.
