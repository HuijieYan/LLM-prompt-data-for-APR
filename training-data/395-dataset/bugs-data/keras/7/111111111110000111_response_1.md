The error message indicates that the output of the `predict` function is a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when predict() is called on input with shape (1, num_features).

The problem location within the `predict` function is that the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))` is causing the output to be a 0-dimensional array.

The bug occurred because the `np.squeeze` function removes the 0-dimensional axis, resulting in a 0-dimensional array instead of keeping the 1-dimensional array with 1 element.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `predict` function to correctly handle the output without using `np.squeeze`. Instead, we can return the output as is, ensuring that the array's dimensions are preserved.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Returns predictions for the given test data.

        # Arguments
            x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
                Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
                and `n_features` is the number of features.
            **kwargs: dictionary arguments
                Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

        # Returns
            preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
                Predictions.
        """
        return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```
