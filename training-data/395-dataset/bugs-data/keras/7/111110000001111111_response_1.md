The bug occurs because the `predict` function in the `KerasRegressor` class is inappropriately squashing the size-1 batch dimension. This results in the output being a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element, leading to a `TypeError` when it is used in further calculations.

To fix this bug, the `np.squeeze` method is removed from the `predict` function so that the output retains the appropriate shape.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the output of the `predict` function will have the correct shape, and the error indicated in the GitHub issue will be resolved.
