Potential Error Location: The `predict` function has a call to `self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)`, which seems to be attempting to call `filter_sk_params` from the outer scope, but it should be using `self.filter_sk_params` instead.

Reason for the Bug: The `filter_sk_params` function is a method of the class, so it should be called using `self`.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The `filter_sk_params` function should be called using `self.filter_sk_params`, and the method signature should be updated to match the class method signature.

Corrected Code:
```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
