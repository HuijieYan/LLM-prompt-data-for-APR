The error message from the test function `test_regression_predict_shape_correct_num_test_1` indicates that the shape of the prediction generated by the `predict` function is not as expected. The issue seems to be related to the shape of the predictions being returned by the `predict` function when the input has a shape of `(1, num_features)`.

The potential error location within the `predict` function is likely here:
```python
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
This is where the predictions are being squeezed to remove any axis with a length of 1.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the input has a shape of `(1, num_features)`, the model's `predict` function returns a 0-dimensional array (a scalar) instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. This causes the assertion in the test function to fail.

To fix this bug, the `predict` function should be modified to ensure that the output shape matches the expected shape, even when the input size is 1.

Here's the corrected version of the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if len(preds.shape) == 1:
        return preds.reshape(-1, 1)  # Add a new axis to make it 2D
    else:
        return np.squeeze(preds)
```

By checking the shape of the predictions and reshaping them if necessary, the corrected function now ensures that the output shape always matches the expected shape, resolving the issue highlighted in the error message.
