The error message shows that the shape of the predictions is expected to be (1,) but is currently returning an empty shape. The issue is likely occurring in the predict() method of the KerasRegressor class.

The reason behind the bug is that the predict() method within the `KerasRegressor` class is inappropriately squashing the size-1 batch dimension. This is leading to the returned shape being incorrect.

To fix the bug, the code in the predict() method needs to be modified to handle the size-1 batch dimension correctly. This may involve ensuring that the output shape is consistent with the input shape.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential().predict, kwargs)  # Correct filter_sk_params function call
    predictions = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)  # Store the predictions
    if predictions.shape[0] == 1:  # If the first dimension is 1, reshape it to (1,)
        return np.reshape(predictions, (1,))
    else:
        return np.squeeze(predictions)  # Otherwise, squeeze the predictions
```

In the corrected code, we now check the shape of the predictions. If the first dimension is 1, we reshape the predictions to have shape (1, ). Otherwise, we return the squeezed predictions. This approach ensures that the size-1 batch dimension is handled correctly, fixing the bug identified in the issue.
