The issue here is that the predict function returns a numpy array of shape (1,) instead of (1,). This is causing the assert statement in the test_regression_predict_shape_correct_num_test_1 function to fail.

The bug is likely occurring because of the np.squeeze method used to return the predictions. If the input is of shape (1, n_features), np.squeeze will remove the single-dimensional entries and return an array of shape (n_features,) instead of (1, n_features).

To fix this issue, the np.squeeze method should be replaced with a simple indexing operation to return the first element if the predictions have shape (1,). This can be done using the [0] index, which explicitly returns the first element.

Here's the corrected code for the predict method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if preds.shape[0] == 1:
        preds = preds[0]
    return preds
```

With this modification, the predict method will return the correct shape for the predictions, and the assert statement in the test_regression_predict_shape_correct_num_test_1 function will pass.
