The error occurs because the `predict` function returns a 0-dimensional array when it should return a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. This is due to the use of `np.squeeze` inside the `predict` function, which removes all the dimensions of size 1 from the input array.

To fix this bug, the `np.squeeze` function should be replaced with another function that preserves the dimensionality of the array.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return np.atleast_1d(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
In this corrected code, `np.atleast_1d` function is used to ensure that the returned array has at least one dimension. This will prevent the issue with the 0-dimensional array.
