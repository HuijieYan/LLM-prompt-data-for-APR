The error occurs when `predict()` is called on input with shape (1, num_features), resulting in the output being a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element. This is due to the use of `np.squeeze` in the original `predict` method, which removes all size-1 dimensions from the input array, causing the output to become a 0-dimensional array.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `predict` method to handle the case when the input shape is (1, num_features) correctly by not squashing the size-1 batch dimension.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the `np.squeeze` function, which was causing the size-1 batch dimension to be squashed. This fix should ensure that the output shape is `(1,)` when the input shape is `(1, num_features)`, as expected.
