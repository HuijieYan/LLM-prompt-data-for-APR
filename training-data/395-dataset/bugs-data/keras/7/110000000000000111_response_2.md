The issue appears to be with the predict method of the KerasRegressor class, which is incorrectly squashing the output to a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input has shape (1, num_features).

The bug occurs because the np.squeeze function is being used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array, which is causing the output to become a 0-dimensional array instead of a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input has shape (1, num_features).

To fix this bug, we can modify the predict method to check the shape of the output and reshape it if necessary to ensure that it is a 1-dimensional array with 1 element when the input has shape (1, num_features).

The corrected code for the predict method is as follows:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if preds.shape[0] == 1:
        return np.array([preds.item()])
    else:
        return np.squeeze(preds)
```

This code checks if the shape of the output is (1,). If it is, the output array is reshaped to a 1-dimensional array with 1 element using np.array([preds.item()]). Otherwise, it returns the output array after squeezing.
