Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the filter_sk_params() method which is not properly handling the parameters.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The filter_sk_params() method does not seem to be correctly handling the parameters passed to it. It might be modifying the kwargs dictionary in a way that causes issues when it is passed to self.model.predict().

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can modify the filter_sk_params() method to handle the kwargs dictionary properly and ensure that it does not cause any issues when passed to self.model.predict().

Corrected code:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    # Assuming filter_sk_params() is a method of the Sequential class
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.model.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
