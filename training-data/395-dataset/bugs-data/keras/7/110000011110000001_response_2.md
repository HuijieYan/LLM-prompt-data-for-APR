The error message indicates that the shape of the predictions (`preds.shape`) is not matching the expected shape, which should be `(1,)` for the given `num_test=1`.

The potential error location within the `predict` method is the following line:
```python
return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

The bug occurs because the `.predict` method returns an empty array (`()`), which does not match the expected shape. This is likely due to incorrect usage or interpretation of the arguments passed to the `.predict` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct arguments are being passed to the `.predict` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    if preds.shape[0] == 1:
        return preds.squeeze()
    else:
        return preds
```

In the corrected code, we first obtain the predictions using `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`. Then, we check if the shape of the predictions is `(1, n_features)` and if so, we use the `squeeze()` method to obtain the desired shape of `(n_features,)`. Otherwise, we return the predictions as they are. This approach ensures that the predictions match the expected shape.
