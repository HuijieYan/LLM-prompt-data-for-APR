The error message indicates that the shape of the predictions `preds` is empty, while it is expected to have a shape of (1,). This means that the predictions are not being returned correctly by the buggy `predict` function in the `KerasRegressor` class.

The potential error location is in the line `return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))` within the `predict` function of the `KerasRegressor` class. It seems that the predictions are not being returned in the correct shape.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the predictions returned by `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`, which results in an empty shape. This may be due to the `np.squeeze` function trying to remove dimensions that aren't there.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to remove the `np.squeeze` function as it might be causing the issue with the shape of the predictions.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

By removing the `np.squeeze` function, the predictions should now be returned with the correct shape, resolving the issue identified in the error message.
