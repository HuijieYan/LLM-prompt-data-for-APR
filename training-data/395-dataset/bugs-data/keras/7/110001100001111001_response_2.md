The error in the provided code is due to the incorrect usage of the `filter_sk_params` function. It seems that the intention is to apply the `filter_sk_params` function to the `kwargs` dictionary, but the current implementation is trying to pass a method (`Sequential.predict`) as an argument to `filter_sk_params`. This is causing the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the `kwargs` dictionary to the `filter_sk_params` function and update the `predict` method accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_7/keras/wrappers/scikit_learn.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def filter_sk_params(self, fn, override=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.model.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```

In the corrected code, we are passing `self.model.predict` and the `kwargs` dictionary to the `filter_sk_params` function. This should address the bug and allow the function to work as expected.
