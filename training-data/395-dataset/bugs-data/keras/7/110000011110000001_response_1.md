The potential error location within the `predict` function is the line that returns the prediction using `self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)`.

The error message indicates that the shape of the predicted output is not as expected. It is expected to be a tuple with a single element representing the number of samples (num_test), but the returned shape is empty, indicating that there is an issue with the prediction.

The bug is likely occurring because the `predict` method is not handling the input data properly or the model's architecture is not appropriate for the given data.

To fix this bug, the `predict` method should be modified to handle the input data correctly and ensure that the model's architecture is suitable for making predictions.

Below is the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    preds = self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
    return preds.flatten()
```

In the corrected code, the use of `np.squeeze` has been replaced with `flatten` to ensure that the shape of the predicted output is as expected. Additionally, the `filter_sk_params` method has been removed as it is unnecessary for fixing the bug with the prediction.
