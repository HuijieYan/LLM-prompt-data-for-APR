# Buggy function source code
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))

```
