The bug occurs in the `predict` method of the `KerasRegressor` class. The bug is caused by using `np.squeeze` to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. This results in an empty shape, i.e., `()`, instead of the expected `(1,)`. 

To fix this bug, the use of `np.squeeze` needs to be removed, as it is not necessary for getting predictions from the Keras model.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
    preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
    Predictions.
    """
    return self.model.predict(x, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the method will return an array-like object with the shape `(n_samples,)`, where `n_samples` is the number of samples in the test data.
