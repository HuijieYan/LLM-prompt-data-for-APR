The error message indicates that the shape of the `preds` array is empty `()`, while it is expected to have a shape of `(1,)`.

The potential error in the bug stems from the line:
```python
kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(Sequential.predict, kwargs)
```
The issue here is that `Sequential.predict` is a method of the `Sequential` class and should not be used as is. This line attempts to filter the keyword arguments for the `predict` method, but it is not doing so correctly, which leads to an incorrect prediction result.

To fix the bug, the correct method to pass as an argument to `filter_sk_params` should be `self.model.predict` and not `Sequential.predict`. Additionally, to ensure that `filter_sk_params` filters the keyword arguments correctly, it should be specified as a method of the `self.model` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.
    
    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.
    
    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    kwargs = self.filter_sk_params(self.model.predict, kwargs)
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
