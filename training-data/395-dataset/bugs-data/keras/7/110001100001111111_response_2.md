The bug in the code is that the `filter_sk_params` function is called with an incorrect parameter within the predict method. This is causing the incorrect output shape.

To fix the bug, the `Sequential.predict` method should be called directly with the provided `kwargs` parameter. It is not necessary to call `filter_sk_params`.

Here's the corrected code for the `predict` method:

```python
def predict(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Returns predictions for the given test data.

    # Arguments
        x: array-like, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`
            Test samples where `n_samples` is the number of samples
            and `n_features` is the number of features.
        **kwargs: dictionary arguments
            Legal arguments are the arguments of `Sequential.predict`.

    # Returns
        preds: array-like, shape `(n_samples,)`
            Predictions.
    """
    return np.squeeze(self.model.predict(x, **kwargs))
```
