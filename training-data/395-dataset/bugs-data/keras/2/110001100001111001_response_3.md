Potential error location: The potential error is in the line `output = np.log(output / (1 - output))`. 

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `output` is being manipulated using the `np.log` and division operations without considering the possibility of `output` being zero or one.

Approach to fix the bug: 
1. Add a clipping mechanism to ensure that `output` stays within a valid range (e.g., (1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)) to prevent division by zero or taking the log of zero.
2. Add the check and handling for the `from_logits` parameter to properly convert the output to logits if needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(output) + (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - output))
```
