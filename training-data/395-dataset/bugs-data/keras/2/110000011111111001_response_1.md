The error message is indicating that the module 'keras.backend.numpy_backend' does not have an attribute 'in_top_k', which is likely to be called in the function we're supposed to fix.

Upon investigating the provided code, we can see that the problematic function is not directly related to the error message from the test function. Instead, the error message is related to the 'in_top_k' function which seems to be called from the 'numpy_backend' module.

The bug in the function `binary_crossentropy` is that it uses `sigmoid` function which is not defined or imported. Moreover, it uses `np.clip` which should also be imported. To fix this bug, we need to import the missing modules and correct the usage of the `sigmoid` function.

To fix the bug, we need to import the missing modules and correct the usage of the `sigmoid` function. Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(expit(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - expit(output)))
```

This fix ensures that the required functions are properly imported and used within the `binary_crossentropy` function.
