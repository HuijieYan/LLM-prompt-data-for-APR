Potential error location: The potential error lies in the calculation of the output. It seems that the function is trying to perform the sigmoid transformation on the output, but the sigmoid function is not defined in the given code.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code references a sigmoid function, but it is not defined in the given code. Additionally, the np.clip function is used without importing the numpy library.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can define the sigmoid function and import the numpy library to use the clip function. Then, use the correct form of the binary cross-entropy loss calculation.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
