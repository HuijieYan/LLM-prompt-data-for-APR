Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_2/keras/backend/numpy_backend.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def sigmoid(x):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def clip(x, min_value, max_value):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
        if not from_logits:
            output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
            output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
        return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
                (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
    
```




# Instructions
