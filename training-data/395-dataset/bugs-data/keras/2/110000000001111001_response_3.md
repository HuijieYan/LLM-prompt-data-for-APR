Potential error location: 
The bug is likely occurring in the computation of the output variable when from_logits is False.

Reason for the bug: 
The bug is caused by the computation of the output variable when from_logits is False. The code is trying to compute the log of the output without correctly handling the case where the output is close to 0 or 1, which leads to numerical instability and potential errors.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the input to the log function is within a valid range.
2. Use the built-in binary cross-entropy implementation available in popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or Keras, which handle numerical stability and other potential issues.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit  # Import the sigmoid function from scipy

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))

    def sigmoid(x):
        return expit(x)

    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
