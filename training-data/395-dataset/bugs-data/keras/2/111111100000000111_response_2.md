Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the `binary_crossentropy` function, especially the use of the `sigmoid` function.

Reason for the bug: The bug may be occurring due to a mix of backend frameworks (CNTK and NumPy) and potential issues with the calculation of the binary cross-entropy.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the correct backend is used for the calculation of binary cross-entropy.
2. Avoid mixing different backend frameworks for the calculation.
3. Use compatible functions from the appropriate backend for the calculation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(output) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - output))
```

Note: The corrected code assumes that the calculation is solely based on NumPy, and an appropriate backend should be used for the actual implementation.
