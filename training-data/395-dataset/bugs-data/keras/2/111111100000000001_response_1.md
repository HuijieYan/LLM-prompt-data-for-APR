The potential error in the given function is that the `sigmoid` function is called without being defined in the given code. It seems like the `sigmoid` function is intended to apply the sigmoid activation function to the output.

The bug occurred because the `sigmoid` function is called without being defined or imported in the given code. The `sigmoid` function should have been imported from the numpy library or defined within the same file.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly import or define the `sigmoid` function and then use it to apply the sigmoid activation to the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `binary_crossentropy` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    sigmoid_output = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-output))  # applying sigmoid activation function
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid_output) + (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid_output))
```

In the corrected code, I've used `np.exp` to calculate the exponential function of the output and then applied the sigmoid function to it, resulting in `sigmoid_output`. This value is then used to calculate the binary cross entropy loss.
