The bug in the function `binary_crossentropy` is that it is using the `np.clip` function without importing the `numpy` library and also using the `np.log` instead of the sigmoid function.

The error suggests that there might be an issue with the ClassificationError operation, which indicates that the output of the binary cross-entropy function might be causing a problem.

The bug is occurring because the `np.clip` function and `np.log` are used without importing the `numpy` library. Additionally, the implementation of the binary cross-entropy function seems to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should import the `numpy` library and replace the usage of `np.clip` and `np.log` with appropriate functions.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
