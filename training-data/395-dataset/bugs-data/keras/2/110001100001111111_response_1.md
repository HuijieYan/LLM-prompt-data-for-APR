Potential error location: The line where the 'sigmoid' function is being called is a potential error location.

Reasons behind the bug: The 'sigmoid' function is being called, but it is not defined in the given code. This function is likely to be a part of the numpy backend, and if it's not defined or imported correctly, it will cause an error.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Import the 'sigmoid' function from the numpy backend or define it within the scope of the 'binary_crossentropy' function.
2. Ensure that the 'sigmoid' function is properly defined and accessible within the scope of the 'binary_crossentropy' function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    def sigmoid(x):
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
    
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) + (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
