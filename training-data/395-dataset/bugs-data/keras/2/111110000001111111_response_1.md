Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the use of the sigmoid function in the `binary_crossentropy` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely due to the use of the `sigmoid` function without it being defined in the `binary_crossentropy` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can define the `sigmoid` function within the `binary_crossentropy` function or import it from a library that contains the `sigmoid` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
In this corrected code, the `sigmoid` function is defined within the `binary_crossentropy` function, resolving the issue related to the undefined function.
