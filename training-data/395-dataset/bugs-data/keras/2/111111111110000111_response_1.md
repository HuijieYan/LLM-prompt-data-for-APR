The test case is attempting to use the function `in_top_k` from the `K` namespace of the CNTK backend. However, the error message indicates that the `in_top_k` function is not found in the `keras.backend.numpy_backend` module, which suggests that the function is not implemented in the backend.

The bug is occurring because the `in_top_k` function is not available in the `keras.backend.numpy_backend` module, which is needed for the test case to run successfully.

To fix this bug, the `in_top_k` function needs to be implemented in the `numpy_backend.py` module, or an alternative approach is to raise a NotImplementedError in the `numpy_backend.py` module to indicate that the functionality is not implemented for the numpy backend.

The corrected code for the problematic function (binary_crossentropy) is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(1 / (1 + np.exp(-output))) + 
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - 1 / (1 + np.exp(-output))))
```
