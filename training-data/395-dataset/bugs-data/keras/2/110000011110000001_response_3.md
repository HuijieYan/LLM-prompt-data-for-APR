The error message indicates that the 'numpy_backend' module from the Keras backend does not have an attribute 'in_top_k', which is being called in the test function. However, the problematic code provided does not contain the 'in_top_k' function, and it seems to be unrelated to the test function.

It appears that the error message is unrelated to the provided function and test case. As a result, the given test function and error message do not provide any relevant information for fixing the provided function.

To fix the provided function 'binary_crossentropy', the following approach can be taken:
- The function is currently using 'np.log' and 'sigmoid' without importing them. These functions need to be imported from an appropriate library such as NumPy or TensorFlow.
- Additionally, the function is using NumPy functions directly, but it would be beneficial to use the imported functions (e.g., 'np.log' should be replaced with 'np.log' or 'math.log').
- Ensure that the 'from_logits' parameter is being handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(output) + (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - output))
```

In this corrected version, the 'np.log' function is used because NumPy has been imported as 'np'. If 'math.log' is preferred, then 'import math' would be necessary along with 'math.log' in place of 'np.log'. Similarly, the 'sigmoid' function would need to be replaced with the appropriate function related to the imported library.
