Potential error location:
The potential error is in the calculation of the binary cross-entropy. The use of the `sigmoid` function seems to be incorrect, as it is not defined in the provided code.

Reason behind the bug:
The `sigmoid` function is not defined in the code, but it is being called in the `binary_crossentropy` function. This will result in a NameError as the `sigmoid` function is not recognized.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `sigmoid` function within the file.
2. Use an existing implementation of the `sigmoid` function from a library like NumPy or TensorFlow.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Corrected binary_crossentropy function
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
