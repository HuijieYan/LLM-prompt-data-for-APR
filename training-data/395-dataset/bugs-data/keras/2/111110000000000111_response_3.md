The bug is likely related to the use of the `sigmoid` function in the `binary_crossentropy` function. The error message suggests that there is a problem with the `ClassificationError` node, which is likely caused by the use of `sigmoid` in the loss calculation.

The bug occurs because the `sigmoid` function is not defined in the provided function, causing a NameError. Additionally, the `np.clip` and `np.log` functions are used without importing the `numpy` module.

To fix the bug, the `sigmoid` function should be defined, and the `numpy` module should be imported. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
