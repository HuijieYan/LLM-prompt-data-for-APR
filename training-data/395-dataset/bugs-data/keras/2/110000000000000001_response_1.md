Potential error: The function is using a 'sigmoid' function that is not defined within the given code.

Reason for the bug: The 'sigmoid' function is not defined within the given code, so it is causing an error when the function is executed.

Approach for fixing the bug: Define the 'sigmoid' function or replace it with a valid function that performs the required operation. Additionally, import the necessary libraries such as numpy.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(output) + (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - output))
```
