The bug is likely in the `binary_crossentropy` function provided, as the error message suggests an issue with the 'ClassificationError' operation, which is related to the calculation of the binary cross-entropy.

The bug is occurring because the `sigmoid` function is not defined within the `binary_crossentropy` function, and it is not clear if `np.clip` is being provided with correct input. Additionally, it seems that the calculation of the binary cross-entropy is not handled correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `sigmoid` function and adjust the calculation of the binary cross-entropy. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return np.mean(-(target * np.log(sigmoid(output)) + (1 - target) * np.log(1 - sigmoid(output))))
```

In the corrected code, we have defined the `sigmoid` function and adjusted the calculation of binary cross-entropy to use `np.mean` for averaging across the batch dimensions. This should fix the bug and provide the correct calculation of binary cross-entropy.
