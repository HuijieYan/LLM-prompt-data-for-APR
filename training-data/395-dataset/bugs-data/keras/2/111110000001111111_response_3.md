The bug in the provided code is due to the use of the `sigmoid` function, which is not defined in the given code. Additionally, the code is missing the necessary import statements for the `numpy` library.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the `numpy` library to use the `np.clip` and `np.log` functions.
2. Define the `sigmoid` function, which is commonly used as the logistic function for binary classification problems.

Here's the corrected code for the `binary_crossentropy` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Corrected function
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```

With the corrected code, the `sigmoid` function is defined and the necessary import statements for the `numpy` library are included. This should resolve the bug in the provided function.
