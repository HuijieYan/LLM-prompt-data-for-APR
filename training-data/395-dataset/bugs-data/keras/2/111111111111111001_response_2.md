The error message indicates that the module 'keras.backend.numpy_backend' does not have an attribute 'in_top_k', which is being called in the test function.

Looking at the provided code, it seems like the problematic function is not related to the error message. The error message references the 'in_top_k' function, but the problematic function is 'binary_crossentropy'.

The potential error location in the code is the 'in_top_k' function being called with the 'numpy_backend' module, which does not have this attribute.

The bug occurred because the 'in_top_k' function was being called from the 'numpy_backend' module, but it does not exist in that module. This could be due to a mismatch in the backend being used for the test and the module being called.

To fix this bug, the correct backend module which contains the 'in_top_k' function needs to be imported and used in the test function.

The corrected code for the 'binary_crossentropy' function will be:

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(1 / (1 + np.exp(-output))) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - 1 / (1 + np.exp(-output))))
```
