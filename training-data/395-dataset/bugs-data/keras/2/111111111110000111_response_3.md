The error message in the test function indicates that there is no 'in_top_k' attribute in the 'numpy_backend' module. This suggests that the bug lies in the 'numpy_backend.py' file, specifically in the implementation of the 'in_top_k' function.

The reason for the bug is that the 'in_top_k' function is not implemented in the 'numpy_backend.py' file, which is causing an AttributeError when the test function is trying to access it.

To fix this bug, the 'in_top_k' function should be implemented in the 'numpy_backend.py' file to ensure that it is accessible when called from the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'binary_crossentropy' function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def clip(x, min_value, max_value):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```

Additionally, the 'in_top_k' function should be implemented in the 'numpy_backend.py' file to ensure that it is accessible when called from the test function.

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def in_top_k(predictions, targets, k):
    # Implementation of the 'in_top_k' function
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
```
