Potential error location: The error might be occurring in the `binary_crossentropy` function where `sigmoid` and `np.log` functions are being used.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `sigmoid` and `np.log` functions are being called without being properly defined or imported. Also, some variables like `np` are used without being imported.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary modules like `numpy` and define the `sigmoid` function within the `numpy_backend` module.
2. Use the imported `numpy` functions instead of the ones that are not imported.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
In the above corrected code, we have imported numpy and defined the sigmoid function explicitly. We have also replaced `np.log` and `np.clip` with `np.log` and `np.clip` respectively to ensure that the numpy functions are being used.
