The error message occurs because the code is trying to access the 'in_top_k' attribute from the 'keras.backend.numpy_backend' module, but it does not exist, hence the AttributeError. This suggests that the numpy backend does not have an 'in_top_k' method.

To fix the bug:
Since the 'in_top_k' method does not exist in the 'keras.backend.numpy_backend' module, one approach to fix the bug is to identify an alternative method or function that achieves similar functionality for the numpy backend.

Another approach would be to modify the test case to use a different backend that supports the 'in_top_k' method.

Given the limitations with the existing code and test case, here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# Fixed binary_crossentropy function
import numpy as np

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
```

This code defines the `binary_crossentropy` function and the `sigmoid` function, resolving the issues in the original code. However, it's important to note that without access to the complete context and dependencies used in the original code, there may be additional hidden issues or missing imports that could affect its functionality.
