Potential Error Location:
The potential error is occurring in the section where the output is transformed using np.log and np.clip. There is also a reference to a function sigmoid() which is not defined in the code provided.

Reason for the Bug:
1. The function sigmoid() is referenced but not defined within the provided code, leading to a NameError.
2. The np.clip() and np.log() operations might not be correctly applied to the 'output' when 'from_logits' is False, leading to potential issues with the calculation.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the sigmoid function or replace the reference to sigmoid with appropriate code.
2. Adjust the np.clip() and np.log() operations to ensure they are applied correctly to the 'output' when 'from_logits' is False.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    else:
        output = sigmoid(output)
    
    return (target * -np.log(output) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - output))
```
