The potential error location within the problematic function is in the way the output is being processed when the 'from_logits' parameter is set to False. The function tries to apply the sigmoid function to the output, but the sigmoid function is not defined in the given code.

The bug occurred because the sigmoid function is not defined in the given code, and therefore cannot be used to transform the output as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to define the sigmoid function and use it to transform the output when 'from_logits' is set to False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
