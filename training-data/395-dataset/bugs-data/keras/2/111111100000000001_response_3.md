Potential error location: The potential error in the code is that the `sigmoid` function is not defined, causing a NameError when the `binary_crossentropy` function is called.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `sigmoid` function is not defined in the given code, which leads to a NameError when the `binary_crossentropy` function uses it. Additionally, the code lacks the required import statement for the `numpy` library, which is needed for functions like `clip` and `log`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `numpy` library at the beginning of the file to use the functions like `clip` and `log`.
2. Define the `sigmoid` function to be able to use it inside the `binary_crossentropy` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
    
def binary_crossentropy(target, output, from_logits=False):
    if not from_logits:
        output = np.clip(output, 1e-7, 1 - 1e-7)
        output = np.log(output / (1 - output))
    return (target * -np.log(sigmoid(output)) +
            (1 - target) * -np.log(1 - sigmoid(output)))
```
