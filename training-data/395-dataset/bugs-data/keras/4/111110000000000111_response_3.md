Potential error location: In the `get_updates` method, the error might be occurring at `grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)` or `opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: It seems like the `compute_gradients` and `apply_gradients` methods are not part of the `Optimizer` class, which is causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to use the methods provided by the specific TensorFlow optimizer that the `TFOptimizer` class is wrapping. We should also ensure that the methods used to compute and apply gradients are correct.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class TFOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """
    Wrapper class for native TensorFlow optimizers.
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function

    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
            grads_and_vars, global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```
