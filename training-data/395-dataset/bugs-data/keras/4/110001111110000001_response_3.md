The error occurs within the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class in the `keras.optimizers` module. The error message states that the `compute_gradients` method is being called with 3 positional arguments, but it only takes 2.

The reason behind this bug is that the `compute_gradients` method of `self.optimizer` is being called with `loss` and `params` as positional arguments. However, it should only take `loss` as a positional argument, and `params` should be passed as keyword arguments. The `compute_gradients` method expects `loss` as the first positional argument and `var_list` as a keyword argument.

To fix this bug, the `compute_gradients` method should be called with the `loss` as a positional argument and `var_list=params` as a keyword argument.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, var_list=params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
