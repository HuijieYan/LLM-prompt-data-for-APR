The error occurs when the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class is called from the test function. The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is receiving more arguments than it can handle. The `compute_gradients` method expects only two positional arguments, but it is receiving three.

The bug is likely occurring because the `compute_gradients` method in the custom TensorFlow optimizer (`MyTfOptimizer`) is not designed to handle the extra positional argument passed from the `get_updates` method of `TFOptimizer`.

To fix this bug, the additional positional argument should be handled properly. This can be done by either modifying the signature of the `compute_gradients` method to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments or by removing the additional positional argument from the `get_updates` method in the `TFOptimizer` class.

The corrected code for the `get_updates` method is as follows:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
