The potential error in the given function is that it is not properly handling the custom optimizer `MyTfOptimizer`. It seems that the `compute_gradients` and `apply_gradients` methods are specific to the internal TensorFlow optimizer, and the custom optimizer `MyTfOptimizer` is not being fully supported by the function.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the custom optimizer `MyTfOptimizer`. This can be done by checking the type of the optimizer and then calling the appropriate methods based on the type of the optimizer.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    if isinstance(self.optimizer, TFOptimizer):
        grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
    else:
        raise ValueError("Custom optimizer type not supported")
```

In the corrected function, it first checks if the optimizer is an instance of `TFOptimizer`. If it is, then it calls the `compute_gradients` and `apply_gradients` methods specific to `TFOptimizer`. If the optimizer is of a different type, it raises a ValueError indicating that the custom optimizer type is not supported. This allows for proper handling of both the internal TensorFlow optimizer and the custom optimizer.
