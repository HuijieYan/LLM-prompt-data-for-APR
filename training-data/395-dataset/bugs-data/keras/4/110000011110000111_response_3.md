1. The test case `test_tfoptimizer_pass_correct_named_params_to_native_tensorflow_optimizer` uses a custom TensorFlow optimizer (`MyTfOptimizer`) wrapped with Keras `TFOptimizer`, and then tries to fit a model using this optimizer. The error message from the test function indicates that the issue is with the `compute_gradients` method in the custom optimizer.

2. The potential error location is the `compute_gradients` method within the custom TensorFlow optimizer `MyTfOptimizer`.

3. The error is occurring because the `compute_gradients` method in the custom optimizer is not designed to accept the `params` argument. In the original `get_updates` method of the Keras optimizer, the `params` argument is passed to the `compute_gradients` method, which is not compatible with the custom optimizer's implementation.

4. To fix the bug, the `compute_gradients` method in the custom TensorFlow optimizer should be modified to accept only the `loss` argument and handle the gradients computation without explicitly passing the `params`. The `apply_gradients` method should also be checked to ensure compatibility with Keras' update mechanism.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    updates = [self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars)]
    return updates
```

In this corrected code, the `compute_gradients` method of the optimizer only accepts the `loss` argument, as it should, and the `params` argument is not explicitly passed. The gradients and variables are computed within the `compute_gradients` method, and then applied using the `apply_gradients` method.
