The error message mentions that the `compute_gradients` method is receiving 3 positional arguments, but it's defined to take only 2. This suggests that the `get_updates` method is incorrectly passing the `params` argument to the `compute_gradients` method.

Based on the input parameter runtime values and types, and the error message, it seems that the `compute_gradients` method in the custom optimizer (`MyTfOptimizer`) is not designed to accept the `params` argument directly, but the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` is trying to pass it. This mismatch in the number of arguments is causing the `TypeError` when the `get_updates` method is trying to call `compute_gradients`.

To fix this issue, you'll need to modify the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class to correctly call the `compute_gradients` method of the custom optimizer (`MyTfOptimizer`) without passing the `params` argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class TFOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """
    Wrapper class for native TensorFlow optimizers.
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    @interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
            grads, global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```

In this corrected code, the `params` argument is removed from the call to `compute_gradients` to ensure that the correct number of arguments is passed. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue.
