The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is receiving 3 positional arguments even though it is defined to only receive 2.

The potential error location is in the `compute_gradients` part of the `TFOptimizer` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `compute_gradients` method is being called with `loss` and `params` as two separate arguments, but it should only be taking `loss` as a positional argument and `**kwargs` for any additional parameters.

To fix the bug, you should modify the `compute_gradients` method in the `MyTfOptimizer` class to accept `**kwargs` as shown below:

```python
def compute_gradients(self, loss, **kwargs):
    return super(MyTfOptimizer, self).compute_gradients(loss, **kwargs)
```

With this change, the `compute_gradients` method in `MyTfOptimizer` class should be able to handle the `loss` argument appropriately.

Now, the corrected code for the `get_updates` method in the `TFOptimizer` class is as follows:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params=params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
