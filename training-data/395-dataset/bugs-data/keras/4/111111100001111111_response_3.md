The potential error in the function is with the variable `self.iterations`. It seems that `self.iterations` is not being properly initialized or updated before calling the `get_updates` function.

The bug is occurring because the `self.iterations` variable is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect gradient updates and optimizer application. The variable `self.iterations` is crucial for updating the optimizer and keeping track of the number of iterations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.iterations` is properly initialized and updated within the `TFOptimizer` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    with tf.control_dependencies(self.updates):
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In the corrected code, we have added `tf.control_dependencies(self.updates)` to ensure that the updates to `self.iterations` are executed before applying the gradients. This will help in properly updating the optimizer and keeping track of the iteration count.
