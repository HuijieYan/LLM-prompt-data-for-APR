Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is the order in which the updates are being appended to the self.updates list.

Reason Behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the updates are being appended in the incorrect order, resulting in the wrong elements being added to the self.updates list.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the order of appending updates to the self.updates list should be corrected.

Corrected Code:

```python
# Corrected function code
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
