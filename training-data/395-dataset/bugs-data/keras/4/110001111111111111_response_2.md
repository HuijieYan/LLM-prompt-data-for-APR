The error occurs in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class, where the `compute_gradients` method is called with three arguments (`loss` and `params`) although it is defined to accept only two positional arguments.

The bug occurs because the `get_updates` method is calling the `compute_gradients` method of the underlying optimizer (`MyTfOptimizer`) with three arguments, but the `compute_gradients` method is defined to accept only two positional arguments. This is causing a `TypeError` to be raised.

To fix this bug, the `get_updates` method should call the `compute_gradients` method with only two positional arguments, as it is defined in the `MyTfOptimizer` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)  # Adjusted to only pass 'loss'
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations, params=params)  # Include params in apply_gradients if necessary
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In the corrected code, the `compute_gradients` method is called with only the `loss` argument, as it is defined, and the `params` variable is passed to the `apply_gradients` method if required.
