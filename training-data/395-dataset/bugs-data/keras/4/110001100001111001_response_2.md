Potential error location: The potential error location is within the `get_updates` function in the `optimizers.py` file.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `compute_gradients` method of `self.optimizer` is not being called correctly. The `compute_gradients` method is not specified in the provided function, and it seems like it should be called in a different way.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the documentation or source code of the `MyTfOptimizer` class to understand the correct way to call the `compute_gradients` method.
2. Ensure that the `compute_gradients` method is being called with the correct parameters and that it returns the expected values.
3. Verify that the optimizer's `apply_gradients` method is being called correctly with the gradients and global step.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    apply_updates = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(apply_updates)
    return self.updates
```
