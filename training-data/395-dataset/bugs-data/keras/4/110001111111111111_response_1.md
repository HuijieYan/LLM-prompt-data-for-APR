The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method in the `MyTfOptimizer` class expects only two positional arguments, but it is receiving three arguments when called within the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where `compute_gradients` is called:
```python
grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `compute_gradients` method is receiving an additional argument (`params`) which it is not designed to handle.

To fix the bug, the number of arguments being passed to `compute_gradients` should be reduced to match its expected signature.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads_and_vars, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In the corrected code, the `compute_gradients` method is called with only the `loss` parameter, and the resulting `grads_and_vars` are used for applying the gradients. This resolves the issue of passing an extra parameter to the `compute_gradients` method.
