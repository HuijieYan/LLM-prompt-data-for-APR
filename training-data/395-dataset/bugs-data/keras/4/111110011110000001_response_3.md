The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is being called with three positional arguments, but it only takes two. This is likely the cause of the bug in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class.

The bug occurred because the `get_updates` method is calling `self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)`, passing both `loss` and `params` as arguments to `compute_gradients`. However, in the `MyTfOptimizer` class, the `compute_gradients` method is defined as `def compute_gradients(self, loss, **kwargs)`, which means it only takes `loss` as a positional argument and any additional keyword arguments as `kwargs`.

To fix the issue, the `get_updates` method should call `self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)` instead of passing `params` as the second argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
