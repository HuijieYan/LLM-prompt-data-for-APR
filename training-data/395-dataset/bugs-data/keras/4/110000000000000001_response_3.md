Potential Error Location: The potential error in this code lies in the `get_updates` function where it attempts to update the gradients based on the loss and parameters.

Reason for the Bug: The bug may be occurring due to the way the function attempts to compute the gradients and apply the updates.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the optimizer has been initialized properly.
2. Ensure that the parameters and loss are compatible with the optimizer being used.
3. Verify that the `global_step` parameter is being used correctly in the `apply_gradients` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, params)
    self.updates = [self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, params))]
    return self.updates
```
