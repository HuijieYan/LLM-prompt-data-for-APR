Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided code is the usage of `@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support`, which seems to be causing the issue.

Reason for the Bug:
It appears that the usage of `@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support` may not be compatible with the method implementation, leading to the bug.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the `@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support` decorator and use the appropriate decorator or method for defining update operations.
2. Review the documentation or source code for the `@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support` to ensure correct usage.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = [self.optimizer.get_updates(loss, params)]
    return self.updates
```
