The error in the given function seems to be related to the use of an outdated method "compute_gradients" in the "self.optimizer" object. This method should be replaced with "get_gradients" which is the updated method used for getting gradients in the TensorFlow optimizer.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.get_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, params), global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In this corrected code, the "compute_gradients" method is replaced with "get_gradients", and the way gradients are applied and updated is also corrected using the "apply_gradients" method. This should resolve the issue and make the function work as intended.
