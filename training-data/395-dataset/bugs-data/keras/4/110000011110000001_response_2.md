Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring within the get_updates method of the TFOptimizer class. Specifically, it seems to be related to the call to self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params), where an incorrect number of positional arguments is being passed.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by an incorrect method signature for the compute_gradients method in the MyTfOptimizer class. It seems that the compute_gradients method is not designed to accept the 'params' argument, resulting in a TypeError when it is invoked with three arguments instead of the expected two.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the compute_gradients method in the MyTfOptimizer class to accept only loss as a positional argument, and then use the 'params' argument as a keyword argument if needed.
2. Revisit the documentation for the compute_gradients method in the TensorFlow optimizer class and ensure that the method is being overridden correctly in the MyTfOptimizer class.

Corrected Code:

```python
# Corrected get_updates method
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, **params)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
