The bug seems to be related to the `self.optimizer.apply_gradients` function. The `apply_gradients` function requires a list of tuples of (gradient, variable), and it seems like this is not being provided correctly.

The bug occurs because the `grads` variable inside the `get_updates` function is a list of tuples containing both the gradients and the variables. However, when calling `self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)`, it's not passing the gradients and variables correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to unpack the `grads` list of tuples and pass them as separate lists of gradients and variables to the `apply_gradients` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` function:

```python
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    grads, vars = zip(*grads_and_vars)  # Unpack the list of tuples into separate lists
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, vars), global_step=self.iterations)  # Pass the separate lists to the apply_gradients function
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
