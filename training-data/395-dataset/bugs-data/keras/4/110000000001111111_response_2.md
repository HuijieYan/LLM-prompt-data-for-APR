Potential Error Location:
The potential error may be in the line where the updates are being appended to `self.updates` list and subsequently returned.

Reason behind the Bug:
The bug may be occurring because the `self.updates` list is first initialized with a Keras update operation `K.update_add` on `self.iterations` and then a native TensorFlow optimizer update operation `self.optimizer.apply_gradients` is being appended to it. This mixing of Keras and native TensorFlow operations could be causing the issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use only Keras update operations for `self.updates` list to ensure consistency.
2. Check if the TensorFlow optimizer is compatible with the Keras update operations and consider using the appropriate Keras optimizer instead.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = self.optimizer.get_updates(loss, params)
    return self.updates
```
