Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `self.updates` list. The code is appending the `opt_update` directly to the `self.updates` list, but the `opt_update` is already included as the second element in `self.updates` from the `K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)` line.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is redundantly adding `opt_update` to the `self.updates` list, which causes a duplication of the update operation.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the redundant addition of `opt_update` to the `self.updates` list.

Corrected code:
```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)  # Apply gradients directly without assigning to a variable
    return self.updates
```
