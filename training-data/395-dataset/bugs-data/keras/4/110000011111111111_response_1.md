The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is receiving 3 positional arguments, but it only takes 2. This means that the `compute_gradients` method is being called with an additional parameter.

The bug is likely located within the `get_updates` method, specifically on the line `grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params)`. The `compute_gradients` method is called with the `loss` and `params` arguments, but it appears that the `self` reference to the `MyTfOptimizer` instance is being passed implicitly as well. This could be the reason for the TypeError.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to remove the reference to `self` when calling `compute_gradients` method of the optimizer. However, it should be noted that it might not be as simple and would depend on the exact implementation of `MyTfOptimizer`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, var_list=params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In this corrected code, the `compute_gradients` method is called with the appropriate arguments, and it's explicitly passing `var_list=params` to specify the list of variables to compute gradients for. This change should resolve the TypeError reported in the error message.
