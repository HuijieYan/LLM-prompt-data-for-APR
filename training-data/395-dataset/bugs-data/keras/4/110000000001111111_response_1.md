Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is related to the way the updates are being appended to `self.updates`. There might be an issue with how the `opt_update` is being appended to `self.updates`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug might occur due to the incorrect manipulation of the updates and the `opt_update` variable. It seems that the updates are not being handled properly, leading to the bug.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the updates are being handled correctly and appended to `self.updates` in the expected format.
2. Verify that the optimizer is properly applied to the gradients and updates the parameters accordingly.

Corrected Code:

```python
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    with tf.control_dependencies([self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, self.iterations)]):
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    
    return self.updates
```
