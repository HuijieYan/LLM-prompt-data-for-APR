The error occurs in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class within the `keras.optimizers` module. The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is being called with three positional arguments, but it only accepts two.

The bug occurs because the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class is not designed to accept the `params` argument. Since the `TFOptimizer` class calls this method with both `loss` and `params` arguments, it results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, the `compute_gradients` method of the `MyTfOptimizer` class should be modified to accept both `loss` and `params` arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/keras_4/keras/optimizers.py

@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In this corrected code, the `self.optimizer.compute_gradients` method is called with only the `loss` argument, and the `apply_gradients` method is also called with `grads_and_vars` obtained from `compute_gradients`. This would resolve the `TypeError` as the `compute_gradients` method is no longer being called with incorrect positional arguments.
