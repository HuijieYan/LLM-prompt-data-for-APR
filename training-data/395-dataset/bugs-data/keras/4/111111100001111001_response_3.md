The potential error location within the problematic function is the `grads` variable, which is a list of tuples containing the gradient tensors and corresponding variables. The error occurs because the `self.optimizer.apply_gradients` method expects gradients to be passed as a dictionary or a list of (gradient, variable) pairs, but the `grads` variable is a list of tuples with both the gradient tensor and the variable.

To fix the bug, we need to convert the `grads` list of tuples into the format expected by the `apply_gradients` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = [(grad, param) for grad, param in zip(
        self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params), params)]
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
        grads_and_vars, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In the corrected code, we create a new list of (gradient, variable) pairs called `grads_and_vars` by iterating through the `grads` list of tuples. Then, we pass `grads_and_vars` to the `apply_gradients` method to fix the bug.
