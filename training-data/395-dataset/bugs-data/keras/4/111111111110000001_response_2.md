The test case is trying to create an instance of the `TFOptimizer` and use it as the optimizer for a Keras model. The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is being called with three arguments, but it is only defined to take two positional arguments.

The potential error location is within the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class. It is likely that when the `compute_gradients` method is called, it is passing the `params` argument as a third argument, which is causing the TypeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `compute_gradients` method is not expecting the `params` argument to be passed to it. It is likely that the original implementation of the method did not account for this additional argument.

To fix the bug, the `compute_gradients` method should be modified to accept the `params` argument. This way, when the method is called, it will not throw a TypeError due to the incorrect number of arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
    @interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
    def get_updates(self, loss, params):
        grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, var_list=params)
        self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
        opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(
            grads, global_step=self.iterations)
        self.updates.append(opt_update)
        return self.updates
```
