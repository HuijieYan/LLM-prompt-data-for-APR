Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `get_updates` method of the `TFOptimizer` class in the file `optimizers.py`. The error is due to the `compute_gradients` method of the optimizer class not supporting named parameters (`loss` and `params`) being passed to it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the `compute_gradients` method is not designed to accept named parameters passed to it, which is causing a TypeError.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by modifying the `get_updates` method to pass the `loss` and `params` as positional arguments to the `compute_gradients` method of the optimizer.

```python
# Corrected function
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```
