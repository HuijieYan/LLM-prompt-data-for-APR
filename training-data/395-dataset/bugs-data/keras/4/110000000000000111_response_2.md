Potential error location: The potential error in the code is with the usage of the `@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support` decorator.

Reason behind the bug: The `@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support` decorator is outdated and is not compatible with the current version of TensorFlow.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Replace the `@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support` decorator with the correct decorator that is compatible with the current version of TensorFlow.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    with tf.control_dependencies([self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads)]):
        updates = [self.iterations.assign_add(1)]
    return updates
```
