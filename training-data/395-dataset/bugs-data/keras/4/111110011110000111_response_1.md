The error message indicates that the `compute_gradients` method is receiving 3 positional arguments, but it only expects 2. This is likely due to the way the `compute_gradients` method is being called in the `get_updates` function of the `TFOptimizer` class.

To fix this, we need to modify the `get_updates` method in the `TFOptimizer` class to correctly call the `compute_gradients` method with the expected arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_updates` method:

```python
@interfaces.legacy_get_updates_support
def get_updates(self, loss, params):
    grads_and_vars = self.optimizer.compute_gradients(loss, params=params)
    self.updates = [K.update_add(self.iterations, 1)]
    opt_update = self.optimizer.apply_gradients(grads_and_vars, global_step=self.iterations)
    self.updates.append(opt_update)
    return self.updates
```

In this corrected code, the `compute_gradients` method is called with the `params` argument explicitly specified, which resolves the issue of passing an extra argument to the method.
