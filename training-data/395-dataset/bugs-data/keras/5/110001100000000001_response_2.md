The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code where the file hash validation is performed. The bug occurs because the function `validate_file` is called with the `algorithm` parameter, which does not exist in the function signature.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `validate_file` function does not have an `algorithm` parameter, so calling the function with this parameter causes an error.

To fix the bug, the `algorithm` parameter should be removed from the `validate_file` function call.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    # ...other code...
    if os.path.exists(fpath):
        # File found; verify integrity if a hash was provided.
        if file_hash is not None:
            if not validate_file(fpath, file_hash):
                print('A local file was found, but it seems to be incomplete or outdated because the file hash does not match the original value, so we will re-download the data.')
                download = True
    else:
        download = True
    # ...other code...
```

In the corrected code, the `validate_file` function is called without the `algorithm` parameter, as it is not required in the function signature.
