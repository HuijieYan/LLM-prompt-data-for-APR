The bug seems to be related to the default value of the cache directory (`cache_dir`) in the `get_file()` function. 

When the `cache_dir` is set to None, the function defaults it to `~/.keras`. This could lead to inconsistency issues, as it may not respect the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable if it is set to a different directory. This might result in models and datasets being stored in different directories, which is not ideal.

To fix this bug, the code could be modified to use the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable as the default cache directory if it is set, otherwise default to `~/.keras`.

Additionally, the function should also handle cases where the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable is set but the cache directory is defined as `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file()` function:

```python
import os

def get_file(
        fname,
        origin,
        untar=False,
        md5_hash=None,
        file_hash=None,
        cache_subdir='datasets',
        hash_algorithm='auto',
        extract=False,
        archive_format='auto',
        cache_dir=None):
    
    # Use KERAS_HOME environment variable as the default cache directory if set
    cache_dir = cache_dir or os.path.expanduser(os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME', '~/.keras'))
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

This fix ensures that the `cache_dir` respects the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable if it is set, thereby addressing the inconsistency issue when `KERAS_HOME` is not `~/.keras`.
