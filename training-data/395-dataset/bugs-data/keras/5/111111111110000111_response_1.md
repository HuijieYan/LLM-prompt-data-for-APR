The error message states that the destination of the downloaded file is inconsistent with the KERAS_HOME directory when 'KERAS_HOME' is not set to ~/.keras. This indicates that the bug is likely to be related to the default value of 'cache_dir' in the 'get_file' function.

The bug occurs because the 'cache_dir' default value does not take into account the custom 'KERAS_HOME' directory that may have been set.

To fix the bug, the 'cache_dir' should default to 'KERAS_HOME' if it's set, and fall back to ~/.keras if 'KERAS_HOME' is not set.

The corrected code for the 'get_file' function is as follows:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.

    By default the file at the url `origin` is downloaded to the
    cache_dir `~/.keras`, placed in the cache_subdir `datasets`,
    and given the filename `fname`. The final location of a file
    `example.txt` would therefore be `~/.keras/datasets/example.txt`.

    Files in tar, tar.gz, tar.bz, and zip formats can also be extracted.
    Passing a hash will verify the file after download. The command line
    programs `shasum` and `sha256sum` can compute the hash.

    # Arguments
        [other arguments...]

    cache_dir: Location to store cached files, when None it
        defaults to the [Keras Directory](/faq/#where-is-the-keras-configuration-filed-stored).

    # Returns
        Path to the downloaded file
    """  # noqa
    
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.environ['KERAS_HOME']
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By updating the 'cache_dir' default value to consider the 'KERAS_HOME' environment variable, the issue with the inconsistent file destination should be resolved.
