The test case `test_data_utils` is asserting that the `data_keras_home` should be equal to the directory of the Keras config path. However, due to some unknown reasons, the `data_keras_home` is pointing to a different directory than expected.

The bug is likely occurring in the `get_file` function's handling of the `cache_dir` where it might not be correctly set when `KERAS_HOME` is specified and not equal to `~/.keras`.

To fix this bug, the `get_file` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the situation when `KERAS_HOME` is specified.

The correction for the `get_file` function is as follows:

```python
import os
import tarfile
import zipfile
from urllib.parse import urljoin, pathname2url
import shutil
from importlib import reload as reload_module

def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.environ['KERAS_HOME']
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')

    # rest of the function remains the same

    return fpath
```

In this corrected code, we check if the `cache_dir` is specified; if not, we use `os.environ['KERAS_HOME']` as the cache directory. This ensures that when `KERAS_HOME` is specified, it will be used as the cache directory, fixing the inconsistency mentioned in the issue.
