The error message suggests that the function `get_file()` is returning a path that is inconsistent with the expected value. This is likely due to the `cache_dir` not being set correctly when `KERAS_HOME` is not equal to `~/.keras`.

The potential error location within the function is when `cache_dir` is set to the default value of `~/.keras` without considering the value of `KERAS_HOME`.

The bug occurs because the function does not take into account the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable when setting the `cache_dir`. As a result, the default cache directory is used, which may be different from the location specified in `KERAS_HOME`. This leads to inconsistencies in file paths and the test failures.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the existence of `KERAS_HOME` and use it as the cache directory if it is defined. Otherwise, it should fall back to the default `~/.keras` location. This ensures that the cache directory is consistent with the Keras backend configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file()` function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...
    """  # noqa
    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ and os.environ['KERAS_HOME'] != '':
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.environ['KERAS_HOME'], cache_subdir)
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In this corrected code, the function checks if the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable is defined and uses it as the cache directory. If not, it falls back to the default `~/.keras` location. This ensures that the cache directory location is consistent with the Keras backend configuration.
