The potential error location within the problematic function is in the part where the default cache directory is defined as `~/.keras`, which may not be consistent with the Keras backend when the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable is not set to the default location.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `get_file()` does not take into account the possibility of a user-defined `KERAS_HOME` environment variable, causing the default cache directory to be inconsistent with the actual location of the Keras configuration file and datasets.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `get_file()` function to take into account the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable and use it as the base directory for the cache, rather than assuming the default location.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# fixed function
def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.

    By default the file at the url `origin` is downloaded to the
    cache_dir `~/.keras`, placed in the cache_subdir `datasets`,
    and given the filename `fname`. The final location of a file
    `example.txt` would therefore be `~/.keras/datasets/example.txt`.

    Files in tar, tar.gz, tar.bz, and zip formats can also be extracted.
    Passing a hash will verify the file after download. The command line
    programs `shasum` and `sha256sum` can compute the hash.

    # Arguments
        fname: Name of the file. If an absolute path `/path/to/file.txt` is
            specified the file will be saved at that location.
        origin: Original URL of the file.
        untar: Deprecated in favor of 'extract'.
            boolean, whether the file should be decompressed
        md5_hash: Deprecated in favor of 'file_hash'.
            md5 hash of the file for verification
        file_hash: The expected hash string of the file after download.
            The sha256 and md5 hash algorithms are both supported.
        cache_subdir: Subdirectory under the Keras cache dir where the file is
            saved. If an absolute path `/path/to/folder` is
            specified the file will be saved at that location.
        hash_algorithm: Select the hash algorithm to verify the file.
            options are 'md5', 'sha256', and 'auto'.
            The default 'auto' detects the hash algorithm in use.
        extract: True tries extracting the file as an Archive, like tar or zip.
        archive_format: Archive format to try for extracting the file.
            Options are 'auto', 'tar', 'zip', and None.
            'tar' includes tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz files.
            The default 'auto' is ['tar', 'zip'].
            None or an empty list will return no matches found.
        cache_dir: Location to store cached files, when None it
            defaults to the [Keras Directory](/faq/#where-is-the-keras-configuration-filed-stored).

    # Returns
        Path to the downloaded file
    """  # noqa
