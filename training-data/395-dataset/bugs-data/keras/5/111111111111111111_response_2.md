The error message indicates that the `K._config_path` does not match the expected `'/Users/jerry/.keras'` value, which implies that the data is not stored in the correct location when KERAS_HOME is not set to the default location.

The potential error location within the function is where the `cache_dir` is set to the default value of `~/.keras`, which does not consider the case where KERAS_HOME is set to a different location.

The bug occurs because the function `get_file` does not handle the case where the `cache_dir` should be the same as `KERAS_HOME` when it is set and does not default to `~/.keras`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to check if `cache_dir` is None and use the value of `os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME')` as the default. If `KERAS_HOME` is not set, then the default directory `~/.keras` should be used.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME', os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras'))

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return fpath
```

With this modification, the `cache_dir` will default to the value of `KERAS_HOME` if it is set, otherwise, it will default to `~/.keras`. This ensures that the data is stored in the correct location based on the KERAS_HOME environment variable.
