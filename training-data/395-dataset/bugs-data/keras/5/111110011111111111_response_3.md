The test case `test_data_utils` attempts to test the `get_file` function by downloading a file from a URL, extracting it, and validating it. However, the test fails with an assertion error when comparing the location of the `data_keras_home` with the location of `K._config_path`.

Upon analyzing the test case and the error message, it appears that the issue arises from the incorrect handling of the default `cache_dir` in the `get_file` function. When the `cache_dir` is not explicitly provided, it defaults to the path `~/.keras`. This behavior leads to inconsistencies when `KERAS_HOME` is set to a different location.

To fix this issue, the `cache_dir` should default to the same directory as `KERAS_HOME` when it is set, ensuring that the config file, models, and datasets are all located in the same folder by default.

The correction involves modifying the behavior of the `cache_dir` initialization within the `get_file` function to accommodate cases where `KERAS_HOME` is not the default `~/.keras` location.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it not already in the cache.
    ... (function documentation remains unchanged)
    """  # noqa

    if cache_dir is None:
        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.path.expanduser(os.environ['KERAS_HOME'])  # use KERAS_HOME if set
        else:
            cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')  # default to ~/.keras

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    return fpath
```

In this corrected version, if `cache_dir` is not provided, it will check if `KERAS_HOME` is set in the environment variables. If it is set, the `cache_dir` will be initialized to the value of `KERAS_HOME`. Otherwise, it will default to `~/.keras`.

This correction ensures that the `cache_dir` is consistent with the location of `KERAS_HOME` when it is set, resolving the issue of inconsistent directory paths and providing better support for custom Keras home directories.
