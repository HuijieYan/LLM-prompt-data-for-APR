The test function is testing the `get_file` function from a URL, including extraction and validation. It involves creating temporary files, using them to extract data, and validating the downloaded files.

The error occurs when the `assert data_keras_home == os.path.dirname(K._config_path)` statement fails, indicating that the `data_keras_home` path doesn't match the expected value.

The bug in the `get_file` function is that it incorrectly uses the `os.path.expanduser` function to define the cache directory. It assumes that `~` represents the home directory, but the cached data should be stored in the `.keras` directory, which could be different from the home directory.

Another issue is the file extraction process, which does not handle the case where the existing file has been extracted.

To fix the bug, we need to determine the location of the cache directory, update the extraction process, and ensure that the paths are correctly handled.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import os
import tarfile
import zipfile
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urljoin
from six.moves.urllib.request import pathname2url, urlretrieve

def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, 
             cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, 
             archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')

    os.makedirs(cache_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    cache_subdir = os.path.join(cache_dir, cache_subdir)
    if not os.path.exists(cache_subdir):
        os.makedirs(cache_subdir)
    
    fpath = os.path.join(cache_subdir, fname)

    download = False
    if os.path.exists(fpath):
        if file_hash is not None:
            if not validate_file(fpath, file_hash, algorithm=hash_algorithm):
                print('A local file was found, but it seems to be '
                      'incomplete or outdated because the ' + hash_algorithm +
                      ' file hash does not match the original value of ' +
                      file_hash + ' so we will re-download the data.')
                download = True
    else:
        download = True

    if download:
        print('Downloading data from', origin)
        urlretrieve(origin, fpath)

    if untar:
        untar_fpath = fpath + '.tar.gz'
        if not os.path.exists(untar_fpath):
            os.rename(fpath, untar_fpath)
            with tarfile.open(untar_fpath, 'r:gz') as tar:
                tar.extractall(cache_subdir)
        return untar_fpath

    if extract:
        _extract_archive(fpath, cache_subdir, archive_format)

    return fpath
```

This corrected function ensures that the cache directory is created if it doesn't exist. It also deals with the extraction process correctly for both `untar` and `extract` scenarios. Additionally, it stores the extracted files in the specified cache subdirectory.
