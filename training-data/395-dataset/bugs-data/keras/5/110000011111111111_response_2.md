The error message from the test function indicates that the cache path for the downloaded file is incorrect. The actual cache directory should match the value of `KERAS_HOME`, but it is currently defaulting to `~/.keras`.

The potential error location within the function is where the `cache_dir` is set to `~/.keras` if it is None, regardless of the value of `KERAS_HOME` in the environment variables.

The bug occurred because the function does not consider the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable when setting the cache directory.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable is set, and if it is, use that as the cache directory. Otherwise, it should default to `~/.keras`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it is not already in the cache.

    By default, the file at the URL `origin` is downloaded to the cache directory specified by the `cache_dir` parameter. If `cache_dir` is not specified, it defaults to `~/.keras`. If the file is compressed, it can also be extracted. Passing a hash will verify the file after download.

    # Other arguments and returns are similar to original function
    """

    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.expanduser('~')

        if 'KERAS_HOME' in os.environ:
            cache_dir = os.environ['KERAS_HOME']

        cache_dir = os.path.join(cache_dir, '.keras')

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return fpath
```

This corrected code explicitly checks for the existence of the `KERAS_HOME` environment variable and uses it as the cache directory if available. Otherwise, it defaults to `~/.keras`. This should ensure that the downloaded files are stored in the correct cache directory.
