Potential Error Location: The potential error location is in the section that validates the file integrity. 

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the file is not being properly validated if a hash was provided. The function should re-download the data if the local file is incomplete or outdated.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check if the file exists and the file hash matches the original value. 
2. If the file hash does not match the original value, re-download the data.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             untar=False,
             md5_hash=None,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    # Rest of the code remains the same as provided in the original function

    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
    if md5_hash is not None and file_hash is None:
        file_hash = md5_hash
        hash_algorithm = 'md5'
    datadir_base = os.path.expanduser(cache_dir)
    if not os.access(datadir_base, os.W_OK):
        datadir_base = os.path.join('/tmp', '.keras')
    datadir = os.path.join(datadir_base, cache_subdir)
    if not os.path.exists(datadir):
        os.makedirs(datadir)

    if untar:
        untar_fpath = os.path.join(datadir, fname)
        fpath = untar_fpath + '.tar.gz'
    else:
        fpath = os.path.join(datadir, fname)

    # Check if file exists and verify integrity if a hash was provided
    if os.path.exists(fpath):
        if file_hash is not None:
            if not validate_file(fpath, file_hash, algorithm=hash_algorithm):
                print('A local file was found, but it seems to be '
                      'incomplete or outdated because the ' + hash_algorithm +
                      ' file hash does not match the original value of ' +
                      file_hash + ' so we will re-download the data.')
                download = True
    else:
        download = True

    # Rest of the code remains the same as provided in the original function
