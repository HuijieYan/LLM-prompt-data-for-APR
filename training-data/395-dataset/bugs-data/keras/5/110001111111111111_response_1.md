In the provided test case, the variable `data_keras_home` is being compared to the directory path of `K._config_path`. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing, as they are different.

The potential error location is likely within the `get_file` function, where the `cache_dir` parameter is not being handled correctly. 

The bug is occurring because the default value of `cache_dir` is not being properly set when `KERAS_HOME` is not `~/.keras`, causing the extracted files to be stored in the default directory. This leads to a discrepancy between the expected and actual paths.

To fix this bug, the `cache_dir` should be set to `KERAS_HOME` if it exists, otherwise, it should default to `~/.keras`. Additionally, the unit test `test_data_utils()` should be modified to ensure that the extracted file `test.txt` is removed at the end of the test.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_file` function:

```python
def get_file(fname, origin, untar=False, md5_hash=None, file_hash=None, cache_subdir='datasets', hash_algorithm='auto', extract=False, archive_format='auto', cache_dir=None):
    if cache_dir is None:
        keras_home = os.environ.get('KERAS_HOME')
        cache_dir = keras_home if keras_home is not None else os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')

    # ... rest of the code ...
```

And the unit test `test_data_utils()` should be updated to ensure proper cleanup of the extracted file `test.txt` at the end of the test.

By making these changes, the function `get_file` will handle the `cache_dir` parameter properly, ensuring that the extracted files are stored in the correct directory when `KERAS_HOME` is not `~/.keras`. This will resolve the inconsistency with the Keras backend.
