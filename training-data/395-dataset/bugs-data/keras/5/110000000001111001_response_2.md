The problem with the buggy function is that it is using deprecated arguments such as `untar` and `md5_hash`. It also has issues with the `validate_file` function and the `ProgressTracker` in the download section.

The `untar` argument is deprecated, and the `extract` argument should be used instead to handle both tar and zip files.

The `validate_file` function is not provided, so it is unclear what it does. It seems to be related to checking the integrity of the downloaded file based on the hash provided, but the implementation is missing.

The `ProgressTracker` class is used for tracking progress during the download, but the implementation can be simplified without using a class.

Finally, the code has some inconsistencies in checking and handling if the file needs to be downloaded.

Here is a possible corrected version of the code:

```python
import os
import requests
from tqdm import tqdm
import tarfile
import zipfile

def get_file(fname,
             origin,
             file_hash=None,
             cache_subdir='datasets',
             hash_algorithm='auto',
             extract=False,
             archive_format='auto',
             cache_dir=None):
    """Downloads a file from a URL if it is not already in the cache.
    
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    # Returns
        Path to the downloaded file
    """  
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.keras')
        
    datadir = os.path.join(cache_dir, cache_subdir)
    os.makedirs(datadir, exist_ok=True)

    fpath = os.path.join(datadir, fname)

    if not os.path.exists(fpath):
        with requests.get(origin, stream=True) as r:
            total_size = int(r.headers.get('content-length', 0))
            with open(fpath, 'wb') as file, tqdm(
                desc=fname,
                total=total_size,
                unit='B',
                unit_scale=True,
                unit_divisor=1024,
            ) as bar:
                for data in r.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
                    file.write(data)
                    bar.update(len(data))

    if file_hash is not None:
        if validate_file(fpath, file_hash, algorithm=hash_algorithm): 
            return fpath
        else:
            print('File hash does not match the original value. Redownloading...')
            os.remove(fpath)

    if extract:
        if archive_format == 'tar':
            with tarfile.open(fpath, 'r:gz') as tar:
                tar.extractall(datadir)
        elif archive_format == 'zip':
            with zipfile.ZipFile(fpath, 'r') as zip_ref:
                zip_ref.extractall(datadir)

    return fpath
```

In this corrected version, we use the requests library for downloading the file and the tqdm library for progress tracking. The file is downloaded directly to the desired location, and the extraction part is handled only if necessary. Additionally, the file's integrity is checked after the download. The `validate_file` function is assumed to be implemented elsewhere.
