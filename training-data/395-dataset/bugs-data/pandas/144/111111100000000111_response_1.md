The problem appears to be related to the inability to set xticks within the bar() plotting function when using the xticks argument. The issue seems to stem from the _decorate_ticks method of the BarPlot class.

The bug occurs because the _decorate_ticks method is not correctly setting the xticks based on the provided arguments. This seems to be causing the xticks argument to have no effect when using the bar() plotting function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _decorate_ticks method to properly handle the xticks argument and set the ticks accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the _decorate_ticks method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        if self.use_index:
            ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))  # Set the xticks based on the length of the ticklabels
            ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        else:
            ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))  # Set the xticks based on the length of the ticklabels
            ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In this corrected code, we are using the range(len(ticklabels)) to set the xticks based on the length of the ticklabels. This should address the issue with the xticks argument having no effect in the bar() plotting function.
