The bug seems to be in the _decorate_ticks function within the BarPlot class. The function is supposed to set the x-axis limits, tick positions, and tick labels, but the xticks are not being set properly.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is trying to set self.tick_pos as the xticks, but it should be using the tick positions defined in the tick_pos variable instead.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to use tick_pos instead of self.tick_pos when setting the xticks.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
