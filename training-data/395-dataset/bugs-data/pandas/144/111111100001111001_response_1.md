The potential error in the buggy function is with the `self.xticks` variable, which is used to set the x-axis tick positions, but it's incorrectly referred to as `self.tick_pos` in the `set_xticks` method.

To fix the bug, the correct variable `self.xticks` should be used to set the x-axis tick positions.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
