Potential error location: The issue seems to be with setting the x-axis limits and ticks.

Reasons behind the bug: It seems that the function is not receiving the correct input parameters for setting the x-axis limits and ticks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can make sure that the input parameters for start_edge, end_edge, and tick_pos are correctly passed to the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, tick_pos):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
