Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the inability to set xticks within the bar() plotting function, as mentioned in the GitHub issue title.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The _decorate_ticks function is not correctly setting the xticks for the bar plot, leading to the xticks argument having no effect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the tick positions are being correctly calculated for the bar plot.
2. Ensure that the xticks argument is being properly passed to the _decorate_ticks function.

Corrected code for the _decorate_ticks function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if self.kind in ['bar', 'barh']:
        ax.set_xticks([i + 0.5 for i in range(len(ticklabels))])
    else:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

This corrected code checks for the 'kind' of plot being generated and sets the xticks accordingly. If the plot type is 'bar' or 'barh', the xticks are positioned at the center of each bar. Otherwise, the xticks are set using the previously calculated tick positions.
