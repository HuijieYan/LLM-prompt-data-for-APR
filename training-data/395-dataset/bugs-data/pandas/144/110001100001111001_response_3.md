Potential Error:
The buggy function `_decorate_ticks` is setting the x-axis limits using `ax.set_xlim()` before setting the tick positions and labels. This can lead to unexpected behavior because the limits are set before the ticks and labels are assigned.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the order of setting the x-axis limits, ticks, and labels is incorrect. When the limits are set before the ticks and labels, it can result in incorrect positioning of the ticks or the labels not being displayed.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
The correct order should be to first set the ticks and labels using `ax.set_xticks()` and `ax.set_xticklabels()`, and then set the x-axis limits using `ax.set_xlim()`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
