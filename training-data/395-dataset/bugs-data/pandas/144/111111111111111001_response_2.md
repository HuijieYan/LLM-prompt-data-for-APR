The error occurs in the `test_xtick_barPlot` test function. The test compares the expected xticks list with the actual xticks obtained from the bar plot. The error message indicates that the shapes of the expected and actual arrays are different. This suggests that the actual xticks are not set correctly, which could be due to the buggy `BarPlot` class method `_decorate_ticks`.

The issue in the buggy function `_decorate_ticks` is that it uses `self.tick_pos` to set the xticks, but in the test case, `self.tick_pos` is an ndarray representing positions, not the actual tick values. The tick position array does not correspond to the `range(0, 11, 2)` specified in the test.

To fix the bug, the `_decorate_ticks` method should use the specified tick values directly from the input parameter `xticks` to set the xticks on the plot.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(self.xticks)
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

This modification will ensure that the xticks are set according to the specified values and will resolve the shape difference issue in the test.
