Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to setting the xticks within the bar() plotting function. The _decorate_ticks function is responsible for setting the xticks and it might be the source of the bug.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be occurring due to the incorrect usage or implementation of setting the xticks within the bar() plotting function. The _decorate_ticks function is not properly handling the xticks argument, which is causing it to have no effect when used.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the _decorate_ticks function to properly handle the xticks argument passed to the bar() plotting function.
2. Ensure that the xticks are correctly set within the bar() plotting function using the _decorate_ticks function.
3. Check for any inconsistencies or errors in the implementation of _decorate_ticks that may be causing the xticks to not take effect.

Corrected code:
```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks=None):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    else:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
