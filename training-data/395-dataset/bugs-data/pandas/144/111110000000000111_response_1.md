The bug seems to be with the `_decorate_ticks` function which is a part of the `BarPlot` class. The function is responsible for setting x-axis limits, ticks, and tick labels.

The error message "unable to set xticks within bar() plotting function" suggests that the xticks argument is not effective within the bar() plotting function. This could be due to the way the xticks are being set within the `_decorate_ticks` function.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` is setting the xticks without considering the xticks argument provided in the plot.bar() function. This is causing the xticks argument to have no effect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_decorate_ticks` function to utilize the xticks argument provided in the plot.bar() function. We can do this by passing the xticks argument to the `_decorate_ticks` function and using it to set the xticks on the plot.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks=None):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

With this modification, the xticks argument provided in the plot.bar() function will be used to set the xticks on the plot, and the bug should be fixed.
