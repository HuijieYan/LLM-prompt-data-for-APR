The error message is indicating that the shapes of the left and right arrays are different. This means there is a discrepancy in the number of elements between the expected and actual arrays.

Upon analyzing the given code, it seems that the issue lies in the `_decorate_ticks` method of the `BarPlot` class. The `self.tick_pos` attribute is set to an ndarray with 10 elements, while the xticks specified in the test function and subsequently passed to the `plot.bar()` method have 6 elements.

The discrepancy in the number of elements is causing the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this bug, one approach is to modify the `_decorate_ticks` method so that it uses the xticks provided as an argument instead of `self.tick_pos`. This change ensures that the number of ticks used for labeling the x-axis matches the provided xticks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By making this change, the method will use the xticks provided as an argument, ensuring that the number of ticks matches the input and resolves the discrepancy in the test case.
