Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `get_xticks()` method, where the shape of the expected numpy array is different from the actual result.

Reason for the bug: The `_decorate_ticks()` function is not setting the tick positions correctly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual tick positions.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Update the `_decorate_ticks()` function to correctly set the tick positions and tick labels based on the input parameters.

Corrected code:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    # Set the x-axis limits
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    
    # Set the x-axis tick positions and labels
    if ticklabels is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)

    # Set the x-axis label if name is not None and self.use_index
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
