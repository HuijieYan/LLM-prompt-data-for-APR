Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the `_decorate_ticks` function within the `BarPlot` class.

Reason for the Bug: The bug is occurring because the `_decorate_ticks` function is not correctly setting the xticks within the bar plot.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace the existing code with a correct implementation that sets the xticks within the bar plot.
2. Use the `ax.set_xticks` method to explicitly set the xticks within the `BarPlot` class.

Corrected Function:

```python
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
