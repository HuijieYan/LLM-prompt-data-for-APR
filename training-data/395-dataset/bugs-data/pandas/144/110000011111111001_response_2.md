The error occurs in the `test_xtick_barPlot` test case when trying to compare the expected xticks with the actual xticks using `assert_numpy_array_equal`. The bug is likely located in the `_decorate_ticks` method, specifically in setting the xticks using `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`.

The bug is occurring because the `xticks` parameter is being passed to the `s.plot.bar()` method, but the `tick_pos` attribute is being used to set the xticks in the `_decorate_ticks` method. This mismatch is causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual xticks, leading to the test failure.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the `xticks` parameter to the `_decorate_ticks` method and use it to set the xticks instead of `self.tick_pos`. Additionally, we should update the `_decorate_ticks` method signature to take the `xticks` parameter as an argument.

Here is the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks=None):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

And here is the corrected `test_xtick_barPlot` test case:

```python
def test_xtick_barPlot(self):
        # GH28172
        s = pd.Series(range(10), index=["P{i:02d}".format(i=i) for i in range(10)])
        ax = s.plot.bar(xticks=np.array(list(range(0, 11, 2))))
        exp = np.array(list(range(0, 11, 2)))
        tm.assert_numpy_array_equal(exp, ax.get_xticks())
```

With these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the test case should pass without any errors.
