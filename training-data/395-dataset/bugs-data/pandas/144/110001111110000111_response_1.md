The error occurs in the `_decorate_ticks` method, specifically in the line `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`. The bug is that the `tick_pos` attribute is not defined within the method, which is causing the `ax.set_xticks()` method to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `tick_pos` attribute is properly defined within the method. We can calculate the `tick_pos` based on the `xticks` argument provided in the `s.plot.bar()` method.

Here's the corrected `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if 'xticks' in self.plot_data:
        ax.set_xticks(self.plot_data['xticks'])
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In this corrected method, we first check if the `xticks` attribute is present in the `plot_data` dictionary (which is a property of the `SeriesPlotMethods` class). If it is present, we use it to set the xticks for the plot.

By making this change, we ensure that the xticks provided in the `s.plot.bar(xticks=range(0, 11, 2))` call will be properly applied to the plot.
