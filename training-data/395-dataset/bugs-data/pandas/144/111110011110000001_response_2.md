The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the shapes of the left and right numpy arrays being compared. This occurs during the comparison of the expected xtick positions (exp) with the actual xtick positions obtained from the `ax` object.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function `_decorate_ticks`, it seems that the issue lies with the `ax.set_xticks` call. The `self.tick_pos` used to set the xticks is not defined within the method, which might be causing the mismatch in the expected and actual xtick positions.

To fix this issue, the `self.tick_pos` needs to be defined within the class and should be updated with the xtick positions specified through the `xticks` parameter when creating the bar plot.

Here's the corrected function for the BarPlot class:

```python
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks=None):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        if xticks is not None:
            ax.set_xticks(xticks)
            self.tick_pos = xticks  # update self.tick_pos with the xticks
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In this corrected function, the `xticks` parameter is added to the method signature to obtain the specified xtick positions. If the `xticks` parameter is provided, it sets the xticks on the axis and updates the `self.tick_pos` with the specified xtick positions. This ensures that the expected and actual xtick positions match, resolving the bug.
