The bug occurs in the _decorate_ticks method of the BarPlot class. The bug prevents the xticks from being set based on the tick_pos attribute.

The bug is caused by the line ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos), which should be setting the xticks based on the self.tick_pos attribute, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _decorate_ticks method to correctly use the tick_pos attribute to set the xticks.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(range(len(self.tick_pos)))
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In the corrected code, ax.set_xticks() is modified to use range(len(self.tick_pos)) to correctly set the xticks based on the tick_pos attribute.
