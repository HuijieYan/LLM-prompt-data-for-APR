The error message from the test function indicates that the xticks set in the `bar` plotting function does not have an effect, causing the AssertionError. This suggests that the `_decorate_ticks` function is not functioning as expected when setting the xticks.

The potential error in the `_decorate_ticks` function is the usage of `self.tick_pos` instead of the input parameter `self.xticks` to set the xticks. This could be the reason why the xticks argument has no effect.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to use the correct input parameter `self.xticks` to set the xticks in the `_decorate_ticks` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.xticks)  # Use self.xticks to set the xticks
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
By using the correct input parameter `self.xticks`, the xticks should now be set properly when using the `bar` plotting function, and the issue described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
