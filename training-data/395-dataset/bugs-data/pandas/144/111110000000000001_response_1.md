Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the line `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` as `self.tick_pos` is not defined in the provided code.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the variable `self.tick_pos` is being used without being defined within the function or outside the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Create a class variable `tick_pos` and initialize it with appropriate values.
2. Pass `tick_pos` as an argument to the function when it is called.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, tick_pos):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(tick_pos)
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
In this corrected code, the function `_decorate_ticks` now accepts an additional argument `tick_pos`. This ensures that `tick_pos` is passed to the function when it is called and the function no longer relies on a class variable for `tick_pos`.
