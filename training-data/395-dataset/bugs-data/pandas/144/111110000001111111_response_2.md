The issue seems to be with the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line inside the `_decorate_ticks` function. The `self.tick_pos` is being set as the xticks, but it should be set as the ticks for the y-axis instead. This is causing the xticks not to be set as expected.

To fix this bug, we need to replace `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` with `ax.set_yticks(self.tick_pos)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_yticks(self.tick_pos)  # Changed from set_xticks to set_yticks
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

With this correction, the xticks should now be set as expected when using the `plot.bar()` function.
