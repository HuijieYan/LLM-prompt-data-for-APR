Potential error location: The issue seems to be with setting the xticks in the bar plot. The xticks argument is not having any effect when using the bar plot.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the buggy function is not correctly setting the xticks for the bar plot.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use ax.set_xticks() to explicitly set the xticks for the bar plot.
2. Ensure that the tick positions are correctly defined and passed to the set_xticks() function.

Corrected code:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
