The bug is occurring in the `_decorate_ticks` function, which is not setting the xticks properly when using the `bar()` plotting function.

The potential error location is within the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line of code. The `self.tick_pos` variable is not being properly set or initialized, which is causing the xticks to not be displayed as expected.

The bug is occurring because the `self.tick_pos` variable is not being assigned a value before the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line is executed. As a result, the xticks are not being properly set when using the `bar()` plotting function.

To fix the bug, the `self.tick_pos` variable needs to be properly initialized and assigned a value before using it to set the xticks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if self.tick_pos:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that `self.tick_pos` is not empty before using it to set the xticks. This will prevent any errors related to uninitialized or empty `self.tick_pos`.
