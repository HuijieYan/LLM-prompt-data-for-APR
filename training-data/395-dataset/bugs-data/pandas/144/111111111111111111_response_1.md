Based on the input parameters and the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the xticks not being set correctly within the `BarPlot` class.

The `_decorate_ticks` method within the `BarPlot` class is responsible for setting xticks, but the bug seems to be related to how the xticks are being set. The method is using the `self.tick_pos` variable, which is an `ndarray` containing the tick positions, but it's not being used to set the actual xticks on the plot.

To fix this bug, the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line should be replaced with `ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))` to ensure that the xticks are set based on the length of the `ticklabels` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))  # Set xticks based on the length of the ticklabels list
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By making this change, the xticks should now be set correctly based on the `ticklabels` list, and the test case should pass without any errors.
