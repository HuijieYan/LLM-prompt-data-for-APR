The error occurs when the `xticks` argument is not taking effect in the `plot.bar()` function. The `test_xtick_barPlot` function is meant to check if the `xticks` argument has any effect on the output plot, but the error message shows that the expected and actual xticks are different.

The potential error location is the `_decorate_ticks` method of the `BarPlot` class, which is responsible for decorating the ticks on the bar plot.

The bug occurs because the xticks are not properly set within the `_decorate_ticks` method. The `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line is used to set the xticks, but it does not take into account the `xticks` argument passed in the `plot.bar()` function.

To fix the bug, the `_decorate_ticks` method should use the `xticks` argument when setting the xticks on the plot.

```python
# Corrected _decorate_ticks method
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if self.xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(self.xticks)
    else:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In the corrected method, the xticks are set using the `self.xticks` attribute, which takes into account the `xticks` argument passed in the `plot.bar()` function. If `xticks` is not provided, it falls back to using `self.tick_pos` as before.

With this fix, the `xticks` argument in the `plot.bar()` function should now have the expected effect on the output plot.
