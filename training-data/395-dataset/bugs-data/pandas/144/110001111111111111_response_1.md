The issue seems to be related to the `get_xticks` method not returning the expected xticks array. This may be due to how the xticks are being set in the `_decorate_ticks` method of the `BarPlot` class.

Upon analysis, it seems that the issue is with the `_decorate_ticks` method. The method sets the xticks using `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`. However, in the test case, the xticks are being set using the `xticks` parameter of the `s.plot.bar()` method. This discrepancy is likely causing the xticks not to be set as expected.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `_decorate_ticks` method to use the `xticks` parameter if it's provided. The method should first check if `self.xticks` is not None, and if it is, it should use that to set the xticks. Otherwise, it should use the `self.tick_pos` as before.

Here's the corrected method:
```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if self.xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(self.xticks)
    else:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

With this modification, the `xticks` provided in the `s.plot.bar()` method should be used to set the xticks in the plot, and the test case should pass without any issues.
