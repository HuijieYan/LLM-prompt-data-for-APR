The bug is likely within the `_decorate_ticks` function, particularly with the line `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`. The error message is not provided, but it is expected to be related to the incorrect type or value being passed to `ax.set_xticks()`.

The bug could be occurring because `self.tick_pos` is of type `ndarray`, but the `ax.set_xticks()` method may expect a different type, such as a list or a range.

To fix the bug, we can convert the `self.tick_pos` ndarray to a list before passing it to `ax.set_xticks()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos.tolist())  # Convert ndarray to list before setting xticks
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
