The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to access the attribute `self.tick_pos` without first defining it within the class. This is likely causing an AttributeError because `self.tick_pos` is not defined.

To fix this issue, the `tick_pos` attribute needs to be defined either within the class or passed as an argument to the `_decorate_ticks` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class BarPlot(MPLPlot):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, tick_pos):
        ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
        ax.set_xticks(tick_pos)
        ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
        if name is not None and self.use_index:
            ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

In this corrected code, `tick_pos` is added as a parameter to the `_decorate_ticks` method and is being used to set the xticks in the function. This assumes that when the `_decorate_ticks` method is called, the caller will provide the `tick_pos` as an argument.
