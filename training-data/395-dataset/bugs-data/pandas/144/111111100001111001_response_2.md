The bug in the given function `_decorate_ticks` is that it tries to set `start_edge` and `end_edge` using the `ax.set_xlim` method. This method expects values to be float or int, but their type is float64. Also, it tries to set the xticks using `ax.set_xticks` with `self.tick_pos` which is an ndarray, but this method expects either an array-like object or scalar.

To fix this bug, we need to convert `start_edge` and `end_edge` to the float type and convert `self.tick_pos` to a list before setting it as xticks.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((float(start_edge), float(end_edge)))
    ax.set_xticks(list(self.tick_pos))
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

With the corrections, the function will work as expected without any type-related errors.
