The error occurs when the test function `test_xtick_barPlot` tries to compare the expected xticks with the actual xticks using `tm.assert_numpy_array_equal()`. The error message indicates that the shapes of the expected and actual arrays are different. This suggests that the xticks are not being set correctly within the `bar` plot.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_decorate_ticks` method, specifically the line `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`.

The bug occurs because the xticks are being set directly using `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`, but the `xticks` argument from the `plot.bar` method should have the priority over the `self.tick_pos` attribute.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_decorate_ticks` method to use the `xticks` argument provided to the `plot.bar` method, and only if it is not provided, then use the `self.tick_pos`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if 'xticks' in ax.properties() and ax.properties()['xticks'] is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(ax.properties()['xticks'])
    else:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

By checking if the `xticks` property is present in the `ax` and using it if available, we ensure that the provided xticks argument takes priority. If not provided, we fall back to using the `self.tick_pos`. This should resolve the issue and allow the xticks to be set correctly within the `bar` plot.
