The error occurs when the test attempts to compare the expected xtick positions with the actual xtick positions on the plot. The bug is likely in the `_decorate_ticks` function, which sets the xtick positions and labels on the plot.

Upon inspecting the function, it seems that the bug is in the line `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` where `self.tick_pos` is not necessarily the same as the xtick positions provided by the user when calling the `plot.bar` method.

The reason for the bug is that the function is using `self.tick_pos` to set the xtick positions instead of the xticks provided when calling the `plot.bar` method. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual xtick positions when the test is run.

To fix the bug, the function should use the xticks provided when calling the `plot.bar` method instead of `self.tick_pos`. This will ensure that the expected and actual xtick positions match during the test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(list(self.xticks))  # Use the xticks provided when calling the plot.bar method
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
