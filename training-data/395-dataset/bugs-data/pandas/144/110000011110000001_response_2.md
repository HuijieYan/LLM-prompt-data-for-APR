The error message is indicating that the shapes of the left and right arrays are different, causing an assertion error when trying to compare them using `tm.assert_numpy_array_equal(exp, ax.get_xticks())`.

Looking at the `test_xtick_barPlot` test function, it seems to be testing the xticks of a bar plot created from a Pandas series. The test is creating a series with an index and then plotting a bar graph with specified xticks.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the way `ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))` is being used. It is not clear from the provided code how `self.tick_pos` is being defined or used, so this could be a potential source of the bug as well.

The bug likely occurred because the `ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))` is not being used correctly and it might be affecting the xtick positions.

To fix the bug, you can try explicitly setting the x-axis limits using `ax.set_xlim(start_edge, end_edge)` and ensure that `self.tick_pos` is correctly defined and used for setting xticks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim(start_edge, end_edge)
    ax.set_xticks(range(len(ticklabels)))  # Assuming ticklabels has the same length as the series
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
