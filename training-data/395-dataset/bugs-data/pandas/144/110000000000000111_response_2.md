Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the inability to set xticks within the bar() plotting function, as indicated in the GitHub issue title.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The _decorate_ticks function is not appropriately handling the setting of xticks within the bar() plotting function. This may be causing the xticks argument to have no effect, as described in the GitHub issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the _decorate_ticks function to properly handle the setting of xticks within the bar() plotting function.
2. Ensure that the xticks argument provided in the plot.bar() function call is correctly utilized within the _decorate_ticks function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks=None):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    if xticks is not None:
        ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    else:
        ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
