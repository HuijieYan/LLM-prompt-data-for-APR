The issue here lies in the _decorate_ticks method of the BarPlot class. The method is intended to set the xticks for the bar plot, but it is not working as expected, as reported in the GitHub issue.

The bug is occurring because the _decorate_ticks method is not correctly handling the xticks argument passed to the bar plot. The method is trying to set the xticks using self.tick_pos, which is not being updated based on the xticks argument provided to the plot function.

To fix this bug, the _decorate_ticks method should extract the xticks from the xticks argument and use them to set the xticks on the plot.

Here is the corrected code for the _decorate_ticks method:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge, xticks):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(xticks)
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```

With this correction, the xticks provided to the bar plot will be correctly reflected in the plot output.
