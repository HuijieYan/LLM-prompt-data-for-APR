The test case `test_xtick_barPlot` is trying to verify the functionality of setting xticks within the `bar` plotting function for a pandas Series. The test is expecting the xticks to be set as specified in the `xticks` argument of the `plot.bar` method call.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the xticks returned by the `ax.get_xticks()` method call. The expected xticks array is of length 6, but the actual xticks array is of length 10, which causes an assertion error.

Based on the error message, it seems that the `_decorate_ticks` function, specifically the line `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)`, is not using the provided xticks as expected. This is likely the cause of the issue faced by the test case.

To fix the bug, the `ax.set_xticks(self.tick_pos)` line should be replaced with `ax.set_xticks(range(0, len(ticklabels)))` to explicitly set the xticks as per the provided tick labels.

Here is the corrected code for the `_decorate_ticks` function:

```python
def _decorate_ticks(self, ax, name, ticklabels, start_edge, end_edge):
    ax.set_xlim((start_edge, end_edge))
    ax.set_xticks(range(0, len(ticklabels)))
    ax.set_xticklabels(ticklabels)
    if name is not None and self.use_index:
        ax.set_xlabel(name)
```
