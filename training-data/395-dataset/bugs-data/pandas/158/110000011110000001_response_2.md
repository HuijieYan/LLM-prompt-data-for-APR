The error occurs because the `rename` method is trying to convert the indexer passed to it into a list, but since `MyIndexer` class does not provide an iterable interface, the conversion fails, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the parameter passed to the `rename` method can be converted into a list without error. This can be achieved by modifying the `rename` method to handle non-mapping indexers differently, possibly by setting the `name` attribute of the `Series` directly.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
    kwargs.pop("inplace", None)
    
    non_mapping = is_scalar(index) or (is_list_like(index) and not is_dict_like(index))

    if non_mapping:
        self.name = index
    else:
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)

    if inplace:
        return self
    else:
        return self.copy()
```

The corrected method directly sets the `name` attribute of the series when a non-mapping indexer is provided. This avoids the conversion to list and resolves the TypeError issue. If `inplace` is set to True, the method returns the modified series, otherwise, it returns a copy of the series with the changes applied.
