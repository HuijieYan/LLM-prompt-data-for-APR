The error occurs because the `Series.rename` method handles anything that isn't a scalar or list-like as a mapping. This causes an issue when an object such as `MyIndexer` is used as the `index` parameter, as it is not callable and triggers a `TypeError` in the internal code.

To fix the bug, the code in the `rename` function should be modified to check if the `index` is callable or dict-like. If it is, the function should call `super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)`, otherwise it should call `self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))`.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ... (existing docstring remains the same) ...
    """

    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

This modification ensures that anything that isn't a dict or a callable will be treated the same way as a scalar or list-like, fixing the issue with `MyIndexer` object.
