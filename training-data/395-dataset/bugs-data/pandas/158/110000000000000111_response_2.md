The test case provided initializes a Series with a custom class `MyIndexer` as the name, which is allowed. However, when trying to call the `rename` method with the same custom class `MyIndexer`, it raises a `TypeError: 'MyIndexer' object is not callable`. This indicates that the bug is likely located within the `rename` method of the `Series` class, specifically in the check for non-mapping types.

The reason for the bug is that the current implementation of the `rename` method in the `Series` class incorrectly handles non-mapping types. It treats anything that isn't a dict-like as a non-mapping type, including callable objects, resulting in the error when the object is not callable.

To fix the bug, we should update the condition to correctly handle non-mapping types. One approach is to check if the index is callable or if it is dict-like. If it is, we should call the superclass's `rename` method; otherwise, we should set the name using the `_set_name` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```
This corrected code should fix the bug and handle non-mapping types correctly, preventing the `TypeError` when non-mapping types are used with the `rename` method.
