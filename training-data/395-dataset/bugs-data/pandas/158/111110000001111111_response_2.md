The error occurs due to the way the `rename` method in the `Series` class handles non-mapping types such as custom classes like `MyIndexer`. The current implementation checks for scalar values or list-like values, but it does not consider custom classes that are not callable.

To fix this bug, the `rename` method should be modified to include a check for callable objects or objects with a dict-like interface. If the object is not callable or dict-like, it should be treated the same way as a scalar or list-like object.

The potential error location is within the `rename` method, specifically in the conditional check for non-mapping types.

The reason behind the bug is that the current implementation of the `rename` method does not consider custom classes that are not callable as non-mapping types, leading to the TypeError when trying to use these objects as an index.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the conditional check in the `rename` method to include a check for callable objects or objects with a dict-like interface. If the object is neither callable nor dict-like, it should be treated as a scalar or list-like object.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ...
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
    
     # New conditional check to handle non-mapping types
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this change, the `rename` method will properly handle non-mapping types such as custom classes that are not callable, and the bug causing the TypeError will be fixed.
