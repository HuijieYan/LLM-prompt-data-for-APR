The error occurs when using the `rename` function on an object that is not callable, such as the `MyIndexer` object in the test case provided. This is because the original code treats anything that is not a scalar or list-like as a mapping, which leads to the error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if the `index` parameter is callable or a dict-like object. If it is neither callable nor dict-like, then we will treat it the same way as a scalar or list-like object.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.

    Function / dict values must be unique (1-to-1). Labels not contained in
    a dict / Series will be left as-is. Extra labels listed don't throw an
    error.

    Alternatively, change ``Series.name`` with a scalar value.

    See the :ref:`user guide <basics.rename>` for more.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : scalar, hashable sequence, dict-like or function, optional
        If callable or dict-like, it will be treated as a mapping to apply to
        the index. If scalar or hashable sequence-like, it will alter the
        ``Series.name`` attribute.
    copy : bool, default True
        Whether to copy underlying data.
    inplace : bool, default False
        Whether to return a new Series. If True then value of copy is
        ignored.
    level : int or level name, default None
        In case of a MultiIndex, only rename labels in the specified
        level.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Series with index labels or name altered.

    See Also
    --------
    Series.rename_axis : Set the name of the axis.
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

By making these changes, the `rename` function will now handle any input that is not a callable or dict-like as a scalar or list-like input, preventing the error that occurred in the test case provided.
