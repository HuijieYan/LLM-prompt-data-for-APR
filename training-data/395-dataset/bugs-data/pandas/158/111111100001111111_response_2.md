The issue here is that the `Series.rename` method is treating anything that isn't a scalar or list-like as a mapping, resulting in an error when non-callable objects like `MyIndexer` are passed to it.

To fix this issue, the code within the `Series.rename` method needs to be updated to handle non-callable objects correctly. The following changes can be made:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ...
    """

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace"))

```

In this updated code, we first check if the `index` is a callable object or a dictionary-like object. If it is, we call the `super().rename()` method. Otherwise, we call the `_set_name` method and handle the `inplace` parameter appropriately. This change should prevent the error when non-callable objects are passed to the `Series.rename` method.
