The issue occurs in the `rename` method of the Series class in pandas. The problem arises when trying to rename a Series using an object that is not callable, resulting in a TypeError.

The potential error location is within the conditional statement in the `rename` method:
```python
non_mapping = is_scalar(index) or (is_list_like(index) and not is_dict_like(index))
if non_mapping:
    return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
```

The bug occurs because non-mapping objects that are not scalar or list-like are not handled properly, leading to a TypeError when trying to use them to rename the Series.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement can be modified to handle non-mapping objects that are not callable or dict-like in the same way as scalar or list-like objects. This can be achieved by checking if the index is callable or dict-like, and if not, treating it as a scalar or list-like.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.

    ... (rest of the docstring)

    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this correction, non-mapping objects that are not callable or dict-like will be handled in the same way as scalar or list-like objects, preventing the TypeError when trying to rename the Series.
