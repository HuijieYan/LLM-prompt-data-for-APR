The test case creates a custom class MyIndexer and then attempts to use it as the index name for a pandas Series. However, when trying to rename the Series using the MyIndexer instance, it raises a TypeError stating that 'MyIndexer' object is not callable.

The issue lies within the Series.rename function, specifically in the code block that determines whether the index is a mapping. This code block incorrectly handles non-mapping objects such as instances of custom classes. It should treat anything that isn't a dict or a callable the same way as a scalar or list-like.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code within the Series.rename function to correctly handle non-mapping objects. We can check if the index is callable or a dict-like object, and if not, treat it similarly to a scalar or list-like object.

Here's the corrected code for the Series.rename function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.
    ...
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```
