The error occurs when the `rename` function is called with an object that is not iterable, such as the `MyIndexer` object. The error is raised because the `rename` function treats anything that isn't a scalar or list-like as a mapping, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `rename` function needs to be updated. The function should consider anything that isn't a dict or a callable as the same way as a scalar or list-like.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.

    Function / dict values must be unique (1-to-1). Labels not contained in
    a dict / Series will be left as-is. Extra labels listed don't throw an
    error.

    Alternatively, change ``Series.name`` with a scalar value.

    See the :ref:`user guide <basics.rename>` for more.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : scalar, hashable sequence, dict-like or function, optional
        dict-like or functions are transformations to apply to
        the index.
        Scalar or hashable sequence-like will alter the ``Series.name``
        attribute.
    copy : bool, default True
        Whether to copy underlying data.
    inplace : bool, default False
        Whether to return a new Series. If True then value of copy is
        ignored.
    level : int or level name, default None
        In case of a MultiIndex, only rename labels in the specified
        level.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Series with index labels or name altered.

    See Also
    --------
    Series.rename_axis : Set the name of the axis.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3])
    >>> s
    0    1
    1    2
    2    3
    dtype: int64
    >>> s.rename("my_name")  # scalar, changes Series.name
    0    1
    1    2
    2    3
    Name: my_name, dtype: int64
    >>> s.rename(lambda x: x ** 2)  # function, changes labels
    0    1
    1    2
    4    3
    dtype: int64
    >>> s.rename({1: 3, 2: 5})  # mapping, changes labels
    0    1
    3    2
    5    3
    dtype: int64
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this correction, the `rename` function will now correctly handle anything that isn't a dict or a callable as the same way as a scalar or list-like, fixing the bug.
