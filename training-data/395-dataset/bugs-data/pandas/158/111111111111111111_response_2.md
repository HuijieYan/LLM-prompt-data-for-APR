The issue seems to arise from the `rename` method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. The function is throwing a TypeError when it encounters an input that is not iterable, even though it should be able to handle non-iterable inputs.

The bug is likely due to the conditional check for non-mapping types in the `rename` method. The condition for `non_mapping` seems to be incorrect and does not handle the input types correctly.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for non-mapping types needs to be modified to correctly handle the input types. One approach is to explicitly check if the `index` is callable or dict-like, and if not, treat it as a non-mapping type. We can then call the `_set_name` method for non-mapping types.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With this modification, the `rename` method should correctly handle non-mapping types and avoid the TypeError that was occurring previously.
