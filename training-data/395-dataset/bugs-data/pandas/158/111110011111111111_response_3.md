The issue arises from the usage of the `rename` method with a custom indexer, which is an object of the `MyIndexer` class. The error message indicates that the `MyIndexer` object is not iterable, which suggests that the bug may be related to the logic that checks whether the `index` parameter is a mapping (i.e., a dict) or non-mapping (i.e., a scalar or list-like). In this case, the custom indexer is not being handled correctly by the `rename` method.

To fix this bug, the `rename` method needs to be updated to properly handle custom indexers and allow them as values accepted by the `Series` constructor.

To resolve this issue, the logic for handling the `index` parameter in the `rename` method should be adjusted as follows:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.

    ... (existing docstring remains unchanged) ...

    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

With these changes, the `rename` method will correctly handle custom indexers. It checks if the `index` parameter is callable (i.e., a function-like object) or dict-like. If it is, the method will proceed with the renaming process using `super().rename`. Otherwise, it will set the name using `self._set_name`.

This fix should address the issue where the `rename` method raises an error when passed custom indexers that are accepted by the `Series` constructor.

By making this code change, the `rename` method will be able to handle custom indexers and accept them as valid values when using the `Series` constructor, thus resolving the bug.

This should be a comprehensive fix for the issue, allowing custom indexers to be used without causing errors in the `rename` method.
