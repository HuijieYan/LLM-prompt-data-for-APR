The error occurs in the `rename` function of the `Series` class. The issue arises due to the `rename` function not handling custom indexers properly.

The bug occurs because the `rename` function incorrectly handles custom indexers. It tries to convert the custom indexer into a list, which results in a TypeError because the custom indexer is not iterable.

To fix the bug, the `rename` function needs to handle custom indexers as a special case and change the name accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if index is not None:
        if callable(index):
            return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
        elif not isinstance(index, (dict, Series)):
            return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))

    return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
```

This corrected code checks if the `index` parameter is callable (a function) or not. If it's callable, it calls the `_set_name` function, otherwise, it defaults to the superclass `rename` method. This way, it handles custom indexers appropriately.
