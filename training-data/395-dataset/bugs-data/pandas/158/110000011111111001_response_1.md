The error occurs because the `rename` function expects the `index` parameter to be a scalar, hashable sequence, dict-like, or function. However, in the test functions, an object of the `MyIndexer` class is passed as the `index`, which is not iterable and causes a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `rename` function needs to handle the case when the `index` provided is an instance of a custom class (in this case, `MyIndexer`). One possible approach to fix the bug is to add a check for custom class instances and handle them appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Alter Series index labels or name.

    Function / dict values must be unique (1-to-1). Labels not contained in
    a dict / Series will be left as-is. Extra labels listed don't throw an
    error.

    Alternatively, change ``Series.name`` with a scalar value.

    See the :ref:`user guide <basics.rename>` for more.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : scalar, hashable sequence, dict-like or function, optional
        dict-like or functions are transformations to apply to
        the index.
        Scalar or hashable sequence-like will alter the ``Series.name``
        attribute.
    copy : bool, default True
        Whether to copy underlying data.
    inplace : bool, default False
        Whether to return a new Series. If True then value of copy is
        ignored.
    level : int or level name, default None
        In case of a MultiIndex, only rename labels in the specified
        level.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Series with index labels or name altered.

    See Also
    --------
    Series.rename_axis : Set the name of the axis.

    Examples
    --------
    ... (same as before)
    """
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    if not callable(index) and not is_dict_like(index):
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
    else:
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
```

This corrected code includes a check for whether `index` is a callable object or a dict-like object. If it is not, then it calls the `_set_name` method to set the name directly. Otherwise, it calls the superclass's `rename` method with the provided `index` and other keyword arguments. This should resolve the TypeError when passing an instance of a custom class as the `index` parameter.
