The test case involves creating a Series with a custom class `MyIndexer` as the name, and then attempting to rename the Series using the same custom class. This results in a TypeError, as the `MyIndexer` object is not callable.

The potential error location within the `rename` function is the `non_mapping` conditional statement:

```python
non_mapping = is_scalar(index) or (
    is_list_like(index) and not is_dict_like(index)
)
```

This conditional statement checks if the `index` parameter is a scalar or a list-like object that is not dict-like, and then calls the `_set_name` method accordingly. However, in the given test case, the `index` parameter is not a scalar or list-like, and it is also not dict-like. This causes the function to treat `index` as a non-mapping object and call `_set_name`, which leads to the TypeError when trying to use the non-callable custom class.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement does not handle the case where `index` is a custom class object, which is not callable.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement in the `rename` function should be modified to check if the `index` parameter is callable or dict-like. If it is callable or dict-like, then the function should call `super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)`, otherwise it should call `self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))`.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    # Checking if the index parameter is callable or dict-like
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

This modification ensures that anything that isn't callable or dict-like will be treated the same way as a scalar or list-like, thus fixing the bug.
