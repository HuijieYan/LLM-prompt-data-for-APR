The error occurs because the `rename` method for the Series is not handling the custom indexer as an input correctly, resulting in a TypeError stating that the custom indexer is not iterable.

The potential error location is identified within the `rename` method of the Series, where it checks whether `index` is a non-mapping type, and if it is, it calls the private method `_set_name`, assuming it's a scalar or list-like object, which is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the `rename` method does not correctly handle custom indexers (such as the `MyIndexer` class in the test case) and assumes it's either a scalar, list-like, or dictionary-like.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statement within the `rename` method to check for callable objects (which would include custom indexers) first, and then for dictionary-like objects. If it's neither of those, it should default to treating it as a scalar or list-like object.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` method:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    if callable(index) or is_dict_like(index):
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
    else:
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
```

This correction ensures that custom indexers are handled correctly and that the `rename` method operates as intended for all types of inputs.
