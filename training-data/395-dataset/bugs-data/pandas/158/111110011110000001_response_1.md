The error occurs when trying to use the `rename` function with a custom indexer object (`MyIndexer`). The error message indicates that the `MyIndexer` object is not iterable, which is necessary for the `rename` function to work properly.

The issue is located in the `rename` function where it attempts to iterate over the provided index object. However, the code does not check if the index object is iterable before trying to iterate over it.

To fix the bug, we should check if the `index` parameter passed to the `rename` function is iterable before trying to use it. If it is not iterable, we can treat it as a scalar and set the `Series.name` attribute accordingly. If it is iterable, we can proceed with the normal `rename` behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `rename` function:

```python
def rename(self, index=None, **kwargs):
    kwargs["inplace"] = validate_bool_kwarg(kwargs.get("inplace", False), "inplace")

    # Check if index is iterable
    if is_scalar(index) or (is_list_like(index) and not is_dict_like(index)):
        return self._set_name(index, inplace=kwargs.get("inplace"))
    else:
        return super().rename(index=index, **kwargs)
```
The `is_scalar`, `is_list_like`, and `is_dict_like` functions are built-in utilities in pandas to check the type of the object.
