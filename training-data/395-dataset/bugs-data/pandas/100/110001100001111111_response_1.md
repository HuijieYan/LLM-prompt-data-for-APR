The problem occurs when using the pct_change function with groupby, where the fill_method is set to None. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the getattr() call, which suggests that the fill_method is expected to be a string but is not passed as one.

The bug is likely to be related to the use of fill_method as an argument to the getattr function within the pct_change method. The function call is trying to get the attribute with the name specified in fill_method, however, it should be directly using the method corresponding to the string value of fill_method.

To fix this bug, the fill_method within the pct_change method should be directly used to call the method, instead of trying to get the attribute using getattr(). This would ensure that the correct method is used based on the fill_method specified.

Here's the corrected code for the pct_change method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    data = self
    if fill_method is not None:
        data = data.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In this corrected version, the fill_method is directly used to call the corresponding method in the fillna process, which should resolve the issue related to the AttributeError caused by the use of getattr().
