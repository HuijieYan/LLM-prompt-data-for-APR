The bug in the provided code is likely due to the `axis` being set to `0` by default without considering the axis for getting the value. This may result in incorrect operations and wrong computation.

To fix this issue, the `axis` should be correctly handled based on the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method with comments:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))  # Get the correct axis
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = data.isna().values
        rs = rs.where(~mask, np.nan)  # Use where method to deal with NaN values
    
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the axis is determined properly and is used in operations to ensure correct computation. Additionally, for handling NaN values, the `where` method is used instead of using `np.putmask` directly to achieve better handling in alignment with the pandas datatypes and operations.
