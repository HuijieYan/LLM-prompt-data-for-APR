The error occurs in the `pct_change` function when the `fill_method` is set to None and the function is applied within a groupby. The error occurs due to an issue with the `getattr` function call within the `pct_change` implementation.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `pct_change` function needs to be updated to handle the case when `fill_method` is None as well as when it is used with a groupby operation.

The corrected code for the `pct_change` function is as follows:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    
    if fill_method is None:
        if limit is not None and limit <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Limit must be greater than 0")

        filled = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit)
        fill_grp = filled.groupby(self.grouper.labels)
        shifted = fill_grp.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq)
    else:
        filled = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        shifted = filled.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)

    rs = filled.div(shifted) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(filled)
    
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(values_from_object(filled))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    
    return rs
```

This corrected code handles the case when `fill_method` is None and the function is used with a groupby, ensuring that the correct operations are performed based on the input parameters.

The corrected code also includes error handling for the case when the `limit` parameter is <= 0, ensuring that a ValueError is raised in such cases.

Finally, the function returns the resulting DataFrame `rs` after performing the necessary calculations.

The corrected code should address the bug and allow the `pct_change` function to work correctly in scenarios where `fill_method` is None and when used with groupby operations.
