The error occurs when the `pct_change` method is invoked with different `fill_method` values. The error message indicates that the DataFrame columns are different at certain indices, showing a percentage difference.

The issue likely arises from the calculation within the `pct_change` method when the `fill_method` is either "pad" or "ffill". It seems that the bug results in incorrect computations and different values than expected, leading to the failed test cases.

To fix the issue, the computation for percentage change needs to be corrected, especially when a `fill_method` is specified. When filling the missing values with the "pad" or "ffill" method, care should be taken to ensure that the subsequent computation for percentage change is accurate and aligns with the expected results.

Corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method=None, limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods, fill_method=None)

    if fill_method:
        mask = rs.isna().any(axis=1)  # Mark the rows with NaN values
        rs = rs.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)  # Do the fill based on fill_method
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)  # Mask the values again
        rs.loc[mask] = np.nan  # Set the rows with NaN values back to NaN
    return rs
```

This corrected method includes a check for `fill_method` to perform the necessary calculations and adjustments based on the specified method. It handles the filling of NaN values and ensures that the percentage change calculation aligns with the expected results for the test cases.
