Potential error location: 

The potential error is in the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))`. The `isna()` method is called without referencing the `self` object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The `isna()` method is being called without referencing the `self` object, which will result in a NameError since `isna` is not defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

To fix this bug, we need to call the `isna` method on the `self` object to check for missing values in the `data` object.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=None, method=fill_method, axis=axis, inplace=False, limit=limit)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, fill_value=None)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = self.isna()
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
