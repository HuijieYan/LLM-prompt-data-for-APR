Potential error location: 

The potential error in the provided function is in the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))`. The function `isna` is called without the appropriate reference to the object, and `com.values_from_object` seems to be an undefined method or attribute.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The code is trying to call the `isna` function without the appropriate reference to the object, and the method `com.values_from_object` is not defined, which causes the bug. This code seems to be incomplete or referencing an undefined method or attribute.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

1. Use the correct reference to the `isna` function, which should be `self.isna`.
2. If `values_from_object` is a custom method, it should be properly defined or replaced with the appropriate method call.

Code for the corrected function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
        rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
        if freq is None:
            mask = self.isna()
            np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
        return rs
```
