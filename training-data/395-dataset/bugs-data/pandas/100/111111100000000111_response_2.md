The issue seems to be occurring when using the `pct_change` function with a groupby and setting `fill_method` to None. The error message suggests that the `getattr` function is being called with `fill_method` as a parameter, which is causing a TypeError.

The potential error location within the `pct_change` function could be with the line that calls `getattr(self, fill_method)(limit=limit)`. This line is attempting to call an attribute on the object using the value of `fill_method`, which is expected to be a string, but in this case, it is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `fill_method` is None, it is being used as an attribute name in the `getattr` function call, which results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `pct_change` function to handle the case where `fill_method` is None. Instead of using `getattr` to call the attribute directly, we can use an if-else condition to check if `fill_method` is None and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

By checking if `fill_method` is None and handling it appropriately, we can ensure that the `pct_change` function works as expected, even with groupby and `fill_method` set to None.
