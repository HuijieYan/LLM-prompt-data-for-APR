The error appears to be related to the pct_change function, which is used to calculate the percentage change between the current and previous element.

The potential error in the code is that the fillna function inside pct_change is using the "method" parameter incorrectly, which causes unexpected results. Additionally, there seem to be issues with data manipulation and comparison, resulting in the test failure.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is improper usage of the fillna method and inconsistencies in data handling, leading to incorrect results and causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the pct_change function to correctly handle the fillna method and ensure proper data manipulation to generate accurate results.

Here's the corrected pct_change function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))

    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(value=None, method=fill_method, axis=axis, inplace=False, limit=limit)

    rs = (data - data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) / data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)

    return rs
```

In this corrected version of the pct_change function, the fillna method is called with the correct parameters to handle missing values appropriately. Additionally, the percentage change calculation has been revised to ensure accurate results.

With this correction, the test case should pass without any errors.
