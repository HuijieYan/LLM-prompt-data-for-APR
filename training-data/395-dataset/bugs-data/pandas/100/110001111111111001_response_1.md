The error is occurring in the `pct_change` method of the DataFrame class. This method is used to calculate the percentage change between the current and previous element in the DataFrame. In the test case, the method is called with different `fill_method` parameters, and the resulting DataFrame is compared to an expected DataFrame using the `tm.assert_frame_equal` method.

The error message indicates that the values are different in the first column of the resulting DataFrame. Specifically, it shows that the percentage change values are different from the expected values.

The issue in the code is with the implementation of the `pct_change` method. The calculations for percentage change are not being performed correctly, resulting in incorrect values in the resulting DataFrame.

One possible approach for fixing the issue is to review and correct the logic for calculating the percentage change in the `pct_change` method. It seems like the calculations for percentage change are not correctly taking into account the `fill_method` and other input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.pct_change(periods=periods, fill_method=fill_method, limit=limit)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the logic for calculating the percentage change has been adjusted to correctly utilize the `fill_method` and other input parameters. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the percentage change is calculated accurately as per the expectations in the test cases.
