The test is trying to check the pct_change function with different fill methods. The main issue seems to be in the calculation of the pct_change in the buggy function.

The main issue in the pct_change method is with the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. This line tries to reindex the result series `rs` using the same index as the original data, but when using pct_change, the index might change and therefore the reindex operation can give unexpected results.

One approach to fix the bug is to reindex using the same logic as shift method, which only keeps the valid values after the shift operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

        shifted = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
        rs = (data - shifted) / shifted
        return rs
```
