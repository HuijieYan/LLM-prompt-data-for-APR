The error in the `pct_change` method is due to the incorrect computation of the  percentage change. The error occurs in the line where `rs` is being calculated as the percentage change.

The reason for the bug is that the `div` method and `shift` method are not being used correctly. Additionally, the data is being treated as a series, which causes the incorrect generation of the `rs` values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct usage of the `div` and `shift` methods, as well as appropriate alignment of the data to calculate the percentage change correctly.

Here's the corrected `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    data = self.copy()  # make a copy so that we don't modify the original data

    data = data.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    
    rs = data.div(shifted_data) - 1
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)

    mask = pd.isna(data)
    data_values = data.values
    np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)

    return rs
```

With this corrected code, the `pct_change` method should generate correct output and pass the provided test cases.
