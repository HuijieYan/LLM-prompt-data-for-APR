The error message indicates that there is a problem within the `pct_change` function, particularly when `fill_method` is set to `None`. The error occurs when the function is called with a `fill_method` of `None`, leading to differing results and the failure of the `assert_frame_equal` test case in the test function.

Looking at the code, the bug seems to be in the `pct_change` function's implementation when `fill_method` is `None`. The function has logic to handle different `fill_methods`, but the logic for handling `None` case is missing. This might be the cause of the different results seen in the test and thus the failure of the test assertion.

To fix this bug, we need to enhance the logic within the `pct_change` function to handle the `None` case properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self.copy()
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.where(~mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

After applying this fix, the `pct_change` function should handle the `fill_method` being `None` correctly and produce the expected results in the test case. Therefore, this fix should resolve the bug.
