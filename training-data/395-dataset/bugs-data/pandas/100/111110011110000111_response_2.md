The buggy function pct_change in the class NDFrame is not working properly as evident from the given error message. The error message is related to a test function that is using the pct_change method. The test function is expecting a certain result but the actual result is different, leading to an assertion error.

After reviewing the code, the potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of the variable "rs" and the subsequent operations on "rs". There could be an issue with the computation of "rs" or the subsequent operations such as filtering and reindexing.

The bug occurs because the pct_change function is not accounting for the case when fill_method is None, which is leading to different results than expected. As a result, the test cases are failing when fill_method is set to None.

A possible fix for this bug is to add a conditional check for fill_method in the pct_change function and handle the case when it is None separately. This can involve altering the logic for the computation of "rs" and associated operations when fill_method is None.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        rs = (self - self.shift(periods)) / self.shift(periods)
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        rs = (data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1)
        rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
        rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
        if freq is None:
            mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
            np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, a conditional check for fill_method is added, and different logic for the computation of "rs" is used based on the value of fill_method. This should address the issue and make the pct_change function work correctly with different values of fill_method, including None.
