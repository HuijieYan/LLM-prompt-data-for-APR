The `pct_change` function seems to be incorrectly computing the percentage change. This method is intended to compute the percentage change between the current element and the prior element.

Looking at the expected outputs, it seems that the logic inside the `pct_change` function is incorrect, which leads to the incorrect calculation of the `rs` DataFrame. The `rs` DataFrame should contain the percentage change between the current and the prior element in the input DataFrame.

Here's the corrected `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shifted = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = (data - shifted) / shifted
    return rs
```

In this corrected function, it computes the percentage change as the difference between the current and the prior element, divided by the prior element. This should provide the correct percentage change for each element, as expected in the test cases provided.
