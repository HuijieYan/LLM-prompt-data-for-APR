1. The function `pct_change` is supposed to calculate the percentage change between the current and previous element along a given axis. However, there are several issues with the current implementation that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location is in the line `rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1`.

3. The bug occurs because the `shift` method does not accept the `freq` and `axis` parameters. It only accepts the `periods` parameter, which specifies the number of shifts to be made.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to remove the `freq` and `axis` parameters from the `shift` method and take only the `periods` parameter into account. Additionally, the use of `fillna` and `reindex_like` methods should be reconsidered.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, **kwargs)
    rs = data.div(shifted_data) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, the `freq` and `axis` parameters have been removed from the `shift` method, and the result is assigned to `shifted_data`. This should fix the bug and allow the function to correctly calculate the percentage change.
