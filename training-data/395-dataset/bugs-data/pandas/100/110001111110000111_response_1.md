The error is likely occurring in the `pct_change` function due to the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))`, which should be replaced with `mask = np.isna(data.values)`. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the DataFrame's values when using the `pct_change` method with different `fill_method` values.

The issue seems to be around how missing values are handled with different `fill_method` values, specifically when `fill_method` is set to `None`. The `pct_change` method fails to handle this case correctly within a groupby operation, as shown in the example.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to update the `pct_change` function to correctly handle the case where `fill_method` is set to `None` and improve the handling of missing values. Additionally, the call to `com.values_from_object(data)` should be replaced with `data.values` for the correct operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the pct_change function
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        rs = self.pct_change(periods=periods, freq=freq, **kwargs)
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
        rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
        if freq is None:
            mask = np.isna(data.values)
            np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

With these changes, the `pct_change` function should now work correctly with different `fill_method` values and handle missing values appropriately. This should resolve the issues seen in the test case.
