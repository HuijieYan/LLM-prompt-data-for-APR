The error seems to be related to the `pct_change` function when the `fill_method` parameter is set to None. The test case prompted the error message related to comparing DataFrame values, indicating a difference in values which is not expected.

The potential error location in the `pct_change` function is likely within the block where it computes the percentage change with the fill method. The division operation and subsequent operations might be causing inconsistencies resulting in failed assertions.

The bug is likely occurring because the `data.fillna` operation, when `fill_method` is None, does not handle `NaN` values correctly, leading to incorrect calculation of percentage change in the subsequent operations.

To fix the bug, the `pct_change` function should handle the case when `fill_method` is None appropriately. It should explicitly check for `NaN` values and handle them to compute the percentage change correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        rs = self.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs) - 1
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

This corrected code handles the `fill_method` parameter being None explicitly, ensuring that the percentage change calculation is handled appropriately in this case.
