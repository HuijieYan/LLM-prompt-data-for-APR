The error in the `pct_change` function is likely in the computation of the `rs` variable. The code should be adjusted to correctly compute the percentage change.

The reason for the bug is that the computation of `rs` is incorrect, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly compute the percentage change based on the given data and fill methods.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
# this is the corrected `pct_change` function
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    shifted_data = self.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    if freq is None:
        mask = data.isna().values_from_object
        np.putmask(shifted_data.values, mask, np.nan)
    rs = (data - shifted_data) / shifted_data
    return rs
```

With the corrected code, the function now correctly computes the percentage change based on the given data and fill methods.
