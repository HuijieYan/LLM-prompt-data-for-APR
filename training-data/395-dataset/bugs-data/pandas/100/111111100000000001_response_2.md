The potential error in the `pct_change` function is related to the `fillna` method call. The `fillna` method is being called with the `axis` parameter, but the `axis` variable that is being passed to the `fillna` method is not explicitly defined in the function signature, causing an error. 

The reason for the bug is that the `fillna` method is being called with an `axis` parameter that is not explicitly defined in the function signature of the `pct_change` method, so the method does not know how to handle it.

To fix the bug, we need to explicitly define the `axis` parameter in the function signature and then pass it to the `fillna` method when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
    @Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, axis=None, **kwargs):
        # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
        rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
        if freq is None:
            mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
            np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
        return rs
```
