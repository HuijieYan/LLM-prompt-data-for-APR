The `pct_change` method of the DataFrame is raising a `AssertionError` when tested with the `test_pct_change_with_duplicated_indices` function. The error message is comparing the values of the DataFrame and finding them different for specific indices.

The potential error in the `pct_change` method is the calculation of the percentage change, and how it interacts with the `fillna` method when `fill_method` is set to None.

The bug seems to occur because when `fill_method` is None, the `fillna` method does not fill missing values, causing issues with the subsequent division operation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `fill_method` is None, missing values are appropriately handled before the division operation occurs.

Here's the corrected `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=1, axis=axis) if fill_method is None else self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)

    if fill_method is None:
        # Handle missing values after the division operation
        mask = pd.isna(self.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)

    return rs
```

In the corrected method, I added a check to handle missing values after the division operation if `fill_method` is None. This should address the issue and ensure that the percentage change calculation works correctly, even when `fill_method` is set to None.
