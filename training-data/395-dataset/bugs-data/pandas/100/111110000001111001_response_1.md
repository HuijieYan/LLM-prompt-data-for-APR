The bug occurs in the `pct_change` function. The bug is caused by incorrect calculation and assignment of the variable `rs`. The expected result for `rs` is not being achieved.

The issue arises because the `shift` operation results in NaN values, which are not being handled properly. This leads to incorrect calculation and assignment of `rs`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the NaN values resulting from the shift operation and update the calculation of `rs` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # TODO: Not sure if above is correct - need someone to confirm.
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    shift_result = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    
    data_div = data.div(shift_result, axis=axis, level=0, fill_value=None)

    rs = data_div - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))
    np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, `shift` operation results are stored in `shift_result`. Then the division of `data` by `shift_result` is performed and stored in `data_div`. Finally, `rs` is calculated as the difference between `data_div` and 1, and the mask is used to handle NaN values.

This corrected code should address the issues with the original code.
