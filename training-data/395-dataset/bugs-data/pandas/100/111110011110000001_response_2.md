The error occurs in the `pct_change` method of the `NDFrame` class. The error message states that the values in the resulting DataFrame are different from the expected values. This is likely due to incorrect calculations or data manipulation within the `pct_change` method.

Looking at the implementation of the `pct_change` method, the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)` is likely causing the issue. This line is intended to reindex the resulting percentage change DataFrame (`rs`) to be similar to the original data (`data`). It is possible that the reindexing process is not being done correctly which leads to incorrect values in the resulting DataFrame.

To fix this bug, it is important to ensure that the reindexing process is done accurately. The `reindex_like` method is used to align the axes of the `rs` DataFrame to the original `data` DataFrame. However, the current implementation lacks proper error handling which might be causing issues.

Here is the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
    
    # Ensure that the reindexing process aligns the axes properly
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data, method=fill_method, limit=limit, tolerance=None)
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.mask(mask, np.nan)
    
    return rs
```

In the corrected code, the `reindex_like` method now includes additional parameters such as `method`, `limit`, and `tolerance` to ensure proper alignment of the axes. Additionally, the `isna` method is called on `rs` directly to identify missing values. The `mask` method is then used to replace those missing values with `np.nan`.

With these changes, the `pct_change` method should now correctly handle reindexing and calculations, preventing the issue reported in the test cases.
