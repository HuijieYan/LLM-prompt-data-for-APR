The code is attempting to define a `pct_change` method for a DataFrame, but the function is incomplete and contains various issues. 

The function is trying to compute the percentage change in the DataFrame values over a given number of periods. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. The logic for processing 'fill_method' is incorrect.
2. It incorrectly calls `fillna` as a method while intending for it to be a function call.
3. The logic for computing 'rs' and applying 'reindex_like' is incorrect.
4. It references 'isna' and 'values_from_object' functions that are not present in the current scope.

To address these issues, the function should be rewritten with proper usage of fillna, correcting the logic to compute the percentage change, and removing unsupported function calls.

Here's the corrected `pct_change` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    rs = (data - data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) / data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    return rs
```

This corrected function properly computes the percentage change by using the `fillna` function, and by directly computing the percentage change using the shifted data. Additionally, unnecessary calls such as 'reindex_like' and 'values_from_object' are removed, as they don't appear to be necessary for the computation.
