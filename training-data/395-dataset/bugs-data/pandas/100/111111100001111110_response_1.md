```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_100/pandas/core/generic.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# This solution of the bug should enable the pct_change function to work well with group by when fill_method = None.
```
