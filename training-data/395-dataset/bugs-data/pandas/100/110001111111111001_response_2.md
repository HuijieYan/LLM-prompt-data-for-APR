The 'pct_change' method is expected to calculate the percentage change between each element and the previous element in the DataFrame. It does so by defaulting to the 'pad' method if 'fill_method' is None. However, the current implementation doesn't seem to provide the expected output. The test function verifies the 'pct_change' method with different fill methods and compares the output with the expected values using the 'tm.assert_frame_equal' function.

There are multiple issues that could be causing the problem in the 'pct_change' method:
1. The mechanism for handling duplicated indices is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect results for duplicated indices.
2. The handling of the 'fill_method' argument might be incorrect, resulting in incorrect calculations.

To fix the buggy function, the code should be updated to correctly handle duplicated indices and ensure that the 'fill_method' argument is handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the 'pct_change' method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated(keep='last')]
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    if freq is None:
        mask = pd.isna(data.values)
        np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```

These changes ensure that duplicated indices are handled correctly and the fill method is applied as expected, providing the correct percentage change output in the DataFrame.
