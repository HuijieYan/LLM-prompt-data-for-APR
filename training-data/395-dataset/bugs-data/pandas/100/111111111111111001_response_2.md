The error occurs at the `pct_change` function, which is probably due to computation errors in the function. This function calculates the percentage change between the current and previous element in the DataFrame.

The pct_change function computes the percentage change between the current and previous element in the DataFrame. The error from the test indicates that the computed percentage change is incorrect.

The cause of the bug might be in the logic of the computation inside the pct_change function. It uses the div and shift methods on the data, and then loc and reindex_like. The bug may be due to incorrect index handling or the computation logic.

To fix this bug:
1. Check the logic involving the DataFrame's index, as this could be causing the computation error.
2. Verify the logic of how the div and shift methods are being used in the pct_change function.
3. Review the logic of loc and reindex_like, ensuring that they are handling the indices correctly.
4. Consider potential edge cases, such as duplicated indices, and ensure that the computation logic handles these cases correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `pct_change` function:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = 1  # Assuming axis 0 as default. Change this based on the specific requirement
    if fill_method is not None:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    else:
        data = self

    # Compute percentage change
    shifted_data = data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)
    rs = data.div(shifted_data) - 1
    rs = rs.dropna()  # Drop rows with NaN values
    rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
    
    return rs
```

In this corrected code, the data is shifted and divided to compute the percentage change, and then any rows with NaN values are dropped. Finally, the result is reindexed using the original data's indices. This should ensure that the computation logic is correctly handling the DataFrame's indices and values.
