The buggy function `pct_change` in the Pandas library can produce incorrect results when the `fill_method` is set to None, especially when used with groupby methods. It is failing to perform as expected and is raising errors when used in certain scenarios, as observed in the provided test failures and GitHub issue description.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        rs = self.divide(self.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis)) - 1
        rs.fillna(value=np.nan, inplace=True)
        rs.iloc[:periods, :] = np.nan
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis)) - 1
    return rs
```

The corrected function addresses the issue by appropriately handling the `fill_method` and performing the calculations to return the expected results. Additionally, it handles the `None` case by setting the missing values to NaN at the appropriate location. This corrected function should fix the errors observed in the test cases and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
