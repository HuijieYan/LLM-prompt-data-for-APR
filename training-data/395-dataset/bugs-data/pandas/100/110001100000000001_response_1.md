Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `mask = isna(com.values_from_object(data))`. The function `isna` and `com.values_from_object` are not defined within the function, and it seems like they should be methods of the `self` object instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error is occurring because the `isna` and `com.values_from_object` methods are not defined within the function, and the intention might have been to use these methods from the `self` object.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The `isna` method needs to be called from the `self` object, and `com.values_from_object` should also use appropriate methods to retrieve the desired results.

```python
    def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
        axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
        if fill_method is None:
            data = self
        else:
            data = self.fillna(value=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)
    
        rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
        rs = rs.loc[~rs.index.duplicated()]
        rs = rs.reindex_like(data)
        if freq is None:
            mask = self.isna()
            np.putmask(rs.values, mask, np.nan)
        return rs
```
