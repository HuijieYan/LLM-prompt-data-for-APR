The error occurs in the `pct_change` method, which computes the percent change between consecutive elements of a DataFrame. The `pct_change` method fails to handle duplicated indices as a result of the `fillna` method. The inputs for the test case include a DataFrame with duplicated indices and specify different `fill_method` parameters to test different scenarios.

The error occurs because the `pct_change` method is not handling the duplicated indices correctly and results in incorrect percent change values.

To fix the bug, the `pct_change` method needs to take into account the duplicated indices and handle the `fill_method` parameter appropriately to calculate the percent change.

Below is the corrected code for the `pct_change` method:

```python
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad"):
    # Add logic to handle duplicated indices by removing duplicates
    data = self[~self.index.duplicated()]
    
    if fill_method is not None:
        data = data.fillna(method=fill_method, axis=0)
        
    data_shifted = data.shift(periods=periods)
    rs = (data - data_shifted) / data_shifted
    return rs
```
In this corrected code, the duplicated indices are handled by removing duplicates before the `pct_change` calculation. The `fill_method` is handled before the calculation to correctly fill missing values in the DataFrame. This should fix the bug and the test cases should pass without errors.
