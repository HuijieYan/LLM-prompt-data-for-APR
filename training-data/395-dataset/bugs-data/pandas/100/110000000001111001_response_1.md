The bug in the function is likely to be in the line `rs = rs.reindex_like(data)`. It seems that the intention here is to reindex `rs` to be like `data`. However, `rs` is a DataFrame resulting from calculations, and reindexing it seems unnecessary.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Unnecessarily reindexing `rs` with the same index as `data`.
2. Incorrect usage of methods or attributes for the `rs` DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary reindexing of `rs` can be removed. Additionally, if necessary, the mask and rs.values creation can be refactored.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["pct_change"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def pct_change(self, periods=1, fill_method="pad", limit=None, freq=None, **kwargs):
    axis = self._get_axis_number(kwargs.pop("axis", self._stat_axis_name))
    if fill_method is None:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self.fillna(method=fill_method, limit=limit, axis=axis)

    rs = data.div(data.shift(periods=periods, freq=freq, axis=axis, **kwargs)) - 1
    if freq is None:
        mask = rs.isna()
        rs = rs.where(~mask, np.nan)
    return rs
```
