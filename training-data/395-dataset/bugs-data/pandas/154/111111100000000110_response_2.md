The issue here seems to be with the `_get_cythonized_result` method of the GroupBy class. To fix this issue, the method needs to be modified to correctly handle timezones. This may involve adding support for timezones in Cython/numpy or modifying the method's logic to preserve the timezone information.

It seems like the issue is related to the shifting of a groupby'd datetime column removing the timezone. The preferred solution would be to modify the `_get_cythonized_result` method to preserve the timezone information during the shifting operation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_cythonized_result` method:

```python
def _get_cythonized_result(
    self,
    how,
    grouper,
    aggregate=False,
    cython_dtype=None,
    needs_values=False,
    needs_mask=False,
    needs_ngroups=False,
    result_is_index=False,
    pre_processing=None,
    post_processing=None,
    **kwargs
):
    # ...existing code...

    for name, obj in self._iterate_slices():
        if aggregate:
            result_sz = ngroups
        else:
            result_sz = len(obj)

        # Preserve timezone information if present
        result = obj.dt.tz_localize(None)

        # ...existing code...

        if result_is_index:
            result = result.dt.tz_localize(obj.dt.tz)

        output[name] = result

    # ...existing code...
```

This modification should preserve the timezone information when performing the shifting operation. Additionally, it's important to update the documentation to indicate that the timezone information will be preserved during the shifting operation.
