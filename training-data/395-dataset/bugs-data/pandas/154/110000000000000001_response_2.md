The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of pre_processing and post_processing functions.

The code checks if post_processing is callable, but the check for pre_processing as callable is done twice, resulting in a redundant check and missing the check for post_processing as callable. Additionally, there is an incorrect comparison on line 60 where it checks if pre_processing is callable.

The correction can be made by modifying the checks for callable functions and adding the missing check for post_processing as callable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_cythonized_result(
    self,
    how,
    grouper,
    aggregate=False,
    cython_dtype=None,
    needs_values=False,
    needs_mask=False,
    needs_ngroups=False,
    result_is_index=False,
    pre_processing=None,
    post_processing=None,
    **kwargs
):
    # ... (same documentation as before)

    if result_is_index and aggregate:
        raise ValueError("'result_is_index' and 'aggregate' cannot both be True!")
    if post_processing and not callable(post_processing):
        raise ValueError("'post_processing' must be a callable!")
    if pre_processing and not callable(pre_processing):
        raise ValueError("'pre_processing' must be a callable!")
    if pre_processing and not needs_values:
        raise ValueError("Cannot use 'pre_processing' without specifying 'needs_values'!")

    # ... (remaining code and return statements stay the same)
```
With these changes, the function should behave as intended without the previous issues.
