The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError on line 1102 in the to_period function. The error is caused by trying to access the attribute 'n' on a NoneType object (freq).

The issue occurs because the freq variable in the to_period function is not being properly handled when it is None. This leads to an AttributeError when freq is used to check its attribute 'n'.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where freq is None in the to_period function. We can either check if freq is None and handle it accordingly or provide a default value for freq if it is None.

Here's the corrected code for the to_period function with the handling of the None freq:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray
    
    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )
    
    if freq is None:
        inferred_freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq
    
        if inferred_freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as the current index has none."
            )
    
        freq = get_period_alias(inferred_freq)
    
    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, if freq is None, we use self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq to get an inferred frequency. If no frequency can be inferred, it raises a ValueError. Otherwise, it uses the inferred frequency to convert to a PeriodArray.
