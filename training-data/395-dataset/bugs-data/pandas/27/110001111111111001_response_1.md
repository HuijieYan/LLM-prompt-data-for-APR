The error occurs in the `to_period` method when trying to access the attribute `n` of the `freq` object, which is `None`. This means that `freq` is not being properly initialized or inferred, leading to an `AttributeError`. 

The potential error location within the `to_period` method is the following block of code:
```python
if freq.n <= 0:
    raise ValueError("no such thing")
```

This block assumes that `freq` is always initialized and has an attribute `n`.

The bug occurs because the frequency is not being correctly inferred or passed to the `to_period` method. It seems that the logic for inferring the frequency (`self.freqstr` and `self.inferred_freq`) is not being correctly implemented. Additionally, the default value for the `freq` parameter is not being handled properly, which leads to the `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug, the following should be done:
1. Properly handle cases where the `freq` is not provided by either inferring it from the data or using a default value.
2. Check the validity of the `freq` before using it to avoid `AttributeError` or other similar issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray
    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError("You must pass a freq argument as current index has none.")

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    if freq is not None and freq.n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid frequency specified")

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `freq` before trying to access its attribute `n`. Additionally, the logic for inferring and defaulting the frequency has been improved.
