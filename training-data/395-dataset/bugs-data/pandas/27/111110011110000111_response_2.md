The error message is indicating an AttributeError on the line `if freq.n <= 0:` within the `dt64arr_to_periodarr` function. This means that the `freq` parameter is None and it is being accessed like an object, resulting in the AttributeError.

The bug is occurring because the `freq` parameter is not being handled properly when it is None. This is leading to the AttributeError when trying to access its attributes.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `freq` parameter is None, and provide a default value in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default if not provided.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        if self.freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )
        freq = get_period_alias(self.freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `self.freq` to be used as the default value for `freq` when it is None. This ensures that a default frequency is used when `freq` is not provided, preventing the AttributeError.
