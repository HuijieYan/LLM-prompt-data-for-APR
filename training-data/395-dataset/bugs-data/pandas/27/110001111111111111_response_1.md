The error occurs on calling the `rng.to_period()` function and the `to_period` method inside the `DatetimeIndex` class. It seems that the `to_period` method is not properly handling the scenario when `freq` is not provided.

The error message indicates that the `freq` variable is being treated as a NoneType object, causing an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'n' attribute. This suggests that the `freq` variable is not being properly handled when its value is None.

The bug occurs because the `to_period` method does not handle the case when `freq` is not provided correctly. When `freq` is not provided, it should be inferred from the data. However, in the current implementation, if `freq` is not provided, it tries to use the value of `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq`, and if those are also None, it raises a ValueError. This causes the `freq` variable to be None and leads to the AttributeError when it is accessed as an attribute.

To fix the bug, the `to_period` method should properly handle the case when `freq` is not provided. It should infer the frequency from the data and use that inferred frequency to create the PeriodArray/Index.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq
        if freq is None:
            freq = pd.infer_freq(self)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, when `freq` is not provided, we use the `pd.infer_freq` method to infer the frequency from the data, and use that inferred frequency to create the PeriodArray/Index. This handles the scenario when `freq` is not provided properly and should resolve the AttributeError issue.
