The error is occurring when the `to_period` method is called on the `rng` object. This method is trying to access the attribute `n` of the `freq` object, which is resulting in an AttributeError because `freq` is None.

The error is occurring because the `freq` parameter is not being handled properly in the `to_period` method. If `freq` is not provided, it is supposed to default to the frequency inferred from the data. However, the code is not handling the case where `freq` is None properly.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `to_period` method to handle the case where `freq` is None by checking for this condition and inferring the frequency from the data if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({"y": [1, 2, 3]},
    ...                   index=pd.to_datetime(["2000-03-31 00:00:00",
    ...                                         "2000-05-31 00:00:00",
    ...                                         "2000-08-31 00:00:00"]))
    >>> df.index.to_period("M")
    PeriodIndex(['2000-03', '2000-05', '2000-08'],
                dtype='period[M]', freq='M')

    Infer the daily frequency

    >>> idx = pd.date_range("2017-01-01", periods=2)
    >>> idx.to_period()
    PeriodIndex(['2017-01-01', '2017-01-02'],
                dtype='period[D]', freq='D')
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

    freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_datetimelike(self, freq)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `freq` is None and then infer the frequency from the data if necessary. We then use the inferred frequency to create the PeriodArray. This should fix the AttributeError that was occurring when `freq` was None.
