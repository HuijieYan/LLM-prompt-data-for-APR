The error message indicates that the `freq` variable in the `to_period` function is being accessed as if it were an object, but it is actually a `NoneType` in one or more test cases.

The potential error location is identified around the following code snippet:
```python
if freq.n <= 0:
```

The bug occurs because the `freq` variable is assumed to be an object with a property `n`, but in the cases where the error occurs, `freq` is `None`. This means that the `freq` variable is not being properly handled when its value is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `freq` variable is properly checked for `None` before accessing its attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    if freq is not None and hasattr(freq, 'n') and freq.n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("`freq` must be a positive integer")

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

In the corrected code, before checking the `freq.n` property, we first ensure that `freq` is not `None` and that it has the necessary attributes. This should prevent the AttributeError when `freq` is `None`.
