The error occurs on the line `pi2 = rng.to_period()` in the `test_to_period_infer` function. The error message states that 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'n' which means that `freq` is None type in the `dt64arr_to_periodarr` method present in the pandas module.

The potential error location in the buggy function is the initialization of `freq`. The function does not handle the case when `freq` is None properly, resulting in the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the buggy function fails to handle the case when the `freq` parameter is not provided and remains None. This can happen when the `freq` is not explicitly specified, and the `self.freqstr` and `self.inferred_freq` are also None.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `freq` is None and determine the frequency based on `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray
    import pandas.api.extensions
    import pandas.tseries.frequencies
    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        if self.freqstr is not None:
            freq = self.freqstr
        elif self.inferred_freq is not None:
            freq = self.inferred_freq
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

        freq = pandas.tseries.frequencies.to_offset(freq)

    return PeriodArray._from_ordinal_representation(self, freq, tz=self.tz)
```
In the corrected code, the `freq` parameter handling has been updated to correctly set the `freq` based on `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq` when `freq` is None. Additionally, the `get_period_alias` function has been replaced with `pandas.tseries.frequencies.to_offset` for inferring the frequency.
