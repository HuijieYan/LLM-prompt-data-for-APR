The error is occurring in the `to_period` function of the `DatetimeArray` class. The error message indicates that there is an attribute error on an object of type `NoneType` in the file `pandas/_libs/tslibs/period.pyx` at line 1575.

The potential error location within the `to_period` function is the following line:
```python
if freq.n <= 0:
```
This line assumes that `freq` is not None and has an attribute `n`. However, the error message indicates that `freq` is actually None, leading to an attribute error when trying to access `n`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `freq` is None, leading to the attribute error when trying to access `n`.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if `freq` is None before accessing its attributes. If `freq` is None, the logic should be handled differently.

Corrected code for the `to_period` function:
```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    if freq is not None:  # Checking if freq is not None
        return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
    else:
        return None  # Return None or handle the case where freq is None
```
In the corrected code, we added a check to see if `freq` is not None before trying to access its attributes. If `freq` is None, the code can return None or handle the case as per the specific requirement.
