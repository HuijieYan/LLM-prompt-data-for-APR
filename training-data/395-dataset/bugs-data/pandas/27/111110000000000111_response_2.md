Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is likely occurring in the `to_period` function at the following line:
```python
freq = get_period_alias(freq)
```
This is where the frequency is being inferred if not provided, and it seems to be causing the AttributeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug seems to occur because when the `freq` argument is not provided, the code attempts to infer the frequency using `get_period_alias(freq)`. However, it seems that the `freq` is None in this case, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access an attribute of a NoneType object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fixing this bug would be to check if the `freq` is None before trying to infer the frequency. If it is None, then the code could use a default frequency or raise a ValueError indicating that the frequency must be provided explicitly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default if not provided.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.
