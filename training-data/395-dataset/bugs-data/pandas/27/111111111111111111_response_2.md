The test case `test_to_period_infer` creates a `PeriodIndex` from a `DatetimeIndex` with a frequency of 5 minutes, and the bug occurs when trying to create the `PeriodIndex` without specifying the frequency.

The bug occurs in the `to_period` method of the `DatetimeArray` class, specifically in the lines:

```python
freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq
freq = get_period_alias(freq)
return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

The error occurs because the `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq` return `None`, leading to the variable `freq` being set to `None`. As a result, when trying to access the attribute `n` of `freq` in the `Period._maybe_convert_freq` method, it raises an `AttributeError` since `freq` is `None`.

To fix the bug, the `to_period` method should handle the case where `freq` is `None` and set a default frequency if it is not provided. One possible approach is to modify the code as follows:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    # Set default frequency if not provided
    if freq is None:
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

        freq = get_period_alias(freq)
    
    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

With this change, the `to_period` method will now handle the case where `freq` is `None` and set a default frequency based on `self.freqstr` or `self.inferred_freq`.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed and the `to_period` method should behave as expected in both test cases.
