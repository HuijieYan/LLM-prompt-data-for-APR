The bug seems to be occurring in the `to_period` function of the `DatetimeArray` class. This function is expected to convert a `DatetimeArray` to a `PeriodArray` at a particular frequency, with the frequency inferred by default if not provided.

Based on the provided input and expected values, the bug seems to be related to the `freq` parameter not being handled correctly. It appears that the frequency is not being properly inferred or assigned.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to update the logic for inferring the frequency and handling the `freq` parameter to ensure that it is used correctly in determining the frequency for the PeriodArray. Additionally, the warning related to dropping timezone information should be handled appropriately.

Below is the corrected function for the `to_period` method:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    """
    Cast to PeriodArray/Index at a particular frequency.

    Converts DatetimeArray/Index to PeriodArray/Index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        One of pandas' :ref:`offset strings <timeseries.offset_aliases>`
        or an Offset object. Will be inferred by default.

    Returns
    -------
    PeriodArray/Index

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When converting a DatetimeArray/Index with non-regular values,
        so that a frequency cannot be inferred.

    See Also
    --------
    PeriodIndex: Immutable ndarray holding ordinal values.
    DatetimeIndex.to_pydatetime: Return DatetimeIndex as object.
    """
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:
        if self.freqstr:
            freq = self.freqstr
        elif self.inferred_freq:
            freq = self.inferred_freq
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

This corrected function handles the case where the `freq` is not provided and infers the frequency using the `freqstr` and `inferred_freq` attributes of the `DatetimeArray`.

This fix should address the bug and ensure that the `to_period` function works as expected in converting a `DatetimeArray` to a `PeriodArray` at the inferred or specified frequency.
