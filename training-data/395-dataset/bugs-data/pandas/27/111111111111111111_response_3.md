The error occurs in the `to_period` function of the `DatetimeArray` class. The `to_period` function is trying to infer the frequency (`freq`) when it is not provided. However, there is a conditional check for `freq.n <= 0` without checking whether `freq` is `None` or not. This leads to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'n' error.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the conditional check for `freq` before accessing its attribute `n`.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_period` function:

```python
def to_period(self, freq=None):
    from pandas.core.arrays import PeriodArray

    if self.tz is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Converting to PeriodArray/Index representation "
            "will drop timezone information.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    if freq is None:  # Add a check for None before accessing the attribute
        freq = self.freqstr or self.inferred_freq

        if freq is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "You must pass a freq argument as current index has none."
            )
        freq = get_period_alias(freq)

    if freq is not None and freq.n <= 0:  # Add a check for freq being not None before accessing its attribute
        raise ValueError("Invalid frequency: must be a multiple of 1 nanosecond")

    return PeriodArray._from_datetime64(self._data, freq, tz=self.tz)
```

With these changes, the function will first check if `freq` is not `None` before accessing its attribute `n`. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
