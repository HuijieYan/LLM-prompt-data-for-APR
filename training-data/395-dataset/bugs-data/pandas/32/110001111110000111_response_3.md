The error is occurring when `pd.read_sas()` is passed a file object from GCSFS. The stack trace indicates that the issue is in the `sas_xport.py` file. Specifically, it fails when trying to encode the contents of the file object, and this is happening at line 280 of `sas_xport.py`.

The reason for the bug is that when a file object is passed, the code is trying to encode its contents, assuming it's encoded in a certain format, which may not be the case. This assumption leads to the AttributeError when the contents are already in bytes format.

To fix the bug, instead of assuming an encoding for the file object, the code should directly use the file object's contents. This can be achieved by removing the attempt to encode the contents and directly using the bytes provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function in `sas_xport.py`:
```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # No need to encode the contents, directly use the bytes provided
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

With this correction, the function should be able to handle file objects from GCSFS without attempting to encode their byte contents.
