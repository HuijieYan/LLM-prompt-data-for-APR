The potential error location within the `__init__` function is the handling of the `filepath_or_buffer` parameter. The function attempts to open the file only if the `filepath_or_buffer` is of type `str` or `bytes`. However, the `filepath_or_buffer` can also be of type `_io.BufferedReader`, as indicated by the input parameter runtime value and type for the buggy function. This leads to the incorrect handling of the `filepath_or_buffer` parameter, resulting in an error.

To fix this bug, we need to include a conditional check for the type of `filepath_or_buffer` and handle the opening of the file accordingly.

The corrected code for the `__init__` function is as follows:

```python
from io import BytesIO

# ... (other imports) ...

class XportReader:
    # ... (other methods) ...

    def __init__(self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None):
        
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize
        
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            (
                filepath_or_buffer,
                encoding,
                compression,
                should_close,
            ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
        elif isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, bytes):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)
        else:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

        self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, an additional conditional check is added to handle the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is of type `bytes`. This is achieved by checking if the `filepath_or_buffer` is an instance of `bytes` and creating a `BytesIO` object accordingly. This modification ensures that the function properly handles different types of input for the `filepath_or_buffer` parameter.
