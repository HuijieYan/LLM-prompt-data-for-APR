The error occurs in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class in the `sas_xport.py` file. The error is due to the attempt to encode the `contents` variable, which is a bytes object, using the `_encoding` attribute.

This occurs because the `contents` variable is directly read from the file, and there is no need to encode it again. The `contents` should be used as is without any additional encoding.

To fix this bug, remove the lines of code that attempt to encode the `contents` with the `_encoding` attribute. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

With this correction, the `contents` variable is used as is when reading from the file, and no additional encoding is attempted. This should resolve the error.
