The error occurs when using the `pd.read_sas` function with a file object from GCSFS. It specifically encounters an AttributeError when trying to encode the contents of the file object.

The potential error location within the `XportReader` class in the `sas_xport.py` file is in the `__init__` method. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to encode the contents of the file object using the specified encoding.

The reason behind the bug is that the code attempts to encode the contents of the file object, assuming it's a string, without checking its type, leading to the AttributeError.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the code to handle both string and bytes types of the file object. If it's a string, the code should open the file and read its contents, and if it's bytes, it should directly create a BytesIO object from the contents.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            (
                filepath_or_buffer,
                encoding,
                compression,
                should_close,
            ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
                self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
            else:
                # Use BytesIO directly if it's bytes type
                self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)
    else:
        # Handle other types of file-like objects
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we check the type of `filepath_or_buffer` and handle string and bytes types separately. If it's bytes, we create a BytesIO object directly from the contents, and for other file-like objects, we handle them as is. This change should fix the AttributeError when trying to encode the contents.
