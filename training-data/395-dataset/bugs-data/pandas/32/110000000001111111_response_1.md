The potential error location within the problematic function is the encoding of the contents. The error message "AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'" indicates that the contents are already in bytes format and cannot be encoded again.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when a file is read from GCSFS using `fs.open`, the contents of the file are already in bytes format. However, the code assumes that the contents need to be encoded based on the specified encoding, which causes the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the code should check the type of the file object and handle the contents accordingly. If the file is already opened in bytes mode, then it should not attempt to encode the contents again. Therefore, we need to modify the code to handle different types of file objects and their contents appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            # If already in bytes format, no need to encode
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if isinstance(contents, bytes):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
        else:
            try:
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

In this corrected code, we check if the `filepath_or_buffer` is already in bytes format and handle it accordingly. If it's a string, we open the file in bytes mode as before. If it's already bytes, we directly use `BytesIO` without encoding the contents again. If it's neither a string nor bytes, we handle the contents as per their type.
