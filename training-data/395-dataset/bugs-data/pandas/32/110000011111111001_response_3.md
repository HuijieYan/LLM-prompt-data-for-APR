The error occurs at the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)` where the `encode()` method is being called on a bytes object, which does not have an `encode` attribute.

To fix this bug, consider using the `BytesIO` class to create a stream from the `filepath_or_buffer` and set its encoding. Then read the contents of the stream and encode them to the desired encoding.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from io import BytesIO

def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure the specified encoding
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer.read().decode(encoding))

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected function, we use `BytesIO` to create a stream from `filepath_or_buffer`, then ensure the specified encoding is used when reading the contents of the stream. This should resolve the error seen in the test case.
