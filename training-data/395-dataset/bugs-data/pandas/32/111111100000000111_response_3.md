The error is occurring in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class in the `sas_xport.py` file. Specifically, the error is happening at the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)`.

The error is occurring because the `contents` variable is of type `bytes`, and the `encode` method is called on it, which is not applicable to bytes objects.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle `contents` differently based on its type (bytes or str). If `contents` is of type `bytes`, we should directly store it in the `filepath_or_buffer` attribute. If it's of type `str`, we should encode it with the provided encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if isinstance(contents, str):
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        self.filepath_or_buffer = contents

    self._read_header()
```
