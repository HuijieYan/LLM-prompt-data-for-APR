After analyzing the issue and the error message, we can see that the bug is occurring in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class. The specific error message is `"AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'"`, which suggests that the `encode` method is being called on a bytes object, which does not have an `encode` method.

The reason behind the bug is that the `filepath_or_buffer` is being read as bytes, but then the `encode` method is being called on it, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is already a bytes object. We can remove the `contents.encode(self._encoding)` line and directly use `contents` to initialize `self.filepath_or_buffer` in the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is not a string or bytes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
    else:
        # filepath_or_buffer is not a string or bytes, handle it accordingly
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

With this fix, the `__init__` method will correctly handle the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is already a bytes object, and the bug should be resolved.
