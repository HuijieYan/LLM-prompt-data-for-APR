Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be located in the `__init__` method of the XportReader class. The method is not properly handling the case when a file object is passed as the `filepath_or_buffer` parameter.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is attempting to encode the contents of the file using the specified encoding (`self._encoding`), which leads to the AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode' error.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `__init__` method must handle the case when a file object is passed properly. It should distinguish between file paths and file objects and handle them accordingly.

Corrected Code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from io import BufferedReader, BytesIO

class XportReader:
    # ... other methods ...

    def __init__(
        self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
    ):
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize
        
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            (
                filepath_or_buffer,
                encoding,
                compression,
                should_close,
            ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
        elif isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (BufferedReader, BytesIO)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input type for filepath_or_buffer")

        self._read_header()

    # ... other methods ...
```

In the corrected code, the `__init__` method has been updated to properly handle the case when a file object is passed. It checks if the `filepath_or_buffer` parameter is a string or a file object (BufferedReader or BytesIO) and assigns it accordingly. It also raises a ValueError if an invalid input type is encountered.
