Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur when trying to encode a bytes object, which is not supported by the `contents.encode(self._encoding)` line. This is likely the cause of the AttributeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `contents` variable is a bytes object, and the `encode()` method is invoked on it, which is not supported for bytes objects.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can handle this situation by checking the type of `contents` before attempting to encode it. If it is a string, we encode it; if it is already bytes, we can leave it as is.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class XportReader(abc.Iterator):

    def _read_header(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def read(self, nrows=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def __init__(
        self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
    ):
    
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize
    
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            filepath_or_buffer, encoding, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
                filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding
            )
    
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            if isinstance(contents, str):
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
    
        self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we first check the type of `contents` after reading from the `filepath_or_buffer`. If it is already a string, we encode it; otherwise, we leave it as is. This should prevent the AttributeError when trying to encode a bytes object.
