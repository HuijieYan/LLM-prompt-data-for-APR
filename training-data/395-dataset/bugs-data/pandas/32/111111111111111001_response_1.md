The error occurs when the `contents` variable is attempted to be encoded with the provided encoding - `self._encoding`. The error message indicates that the `contents` object, which is of type `bytes`, does not have an attribute `encode`.

This happens because the `contents` variable is already a bytes object read from the file, and it does not need to be encoded again.

To fix this issue, the approach would be to directly assign the `contents` to the `self.filepath_or_buffer` without attempting to encode it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Use the 'contents' as it is without encoding
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer.read())

    self._read_header()
```
