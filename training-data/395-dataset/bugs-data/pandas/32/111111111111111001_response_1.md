The error occurs because the code is trying to encode the contents of a file, which is already in bytes, resulting in the 'AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode' error. This means that the 'contents' object is already in bytes format and does not require encoding.

To fix this bug, the 'contents' object should not be encoded if it is already in bytes format. We can modify the code to handle this scenario.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
    def __init__(
        self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
    ):
    
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize
    
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            (
                filepath_or_buffer,
                encoding,
                compression,
                should_close,
            ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
    
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            # No need to encode if contents is already in bytes format
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            if not isinstance(contents, bytes):
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
    
        self._read_header()
```

In this corrected code, we added a condition to check if the 'contents' object is already in bytes format. If it is, then there is no need to encode it. We only encode the contents if it is not in bytes format. This will prevent the 'AttributeError' from occurring.
