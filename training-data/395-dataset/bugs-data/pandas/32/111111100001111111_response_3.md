The error occurs when trying to access the encode() method on the contents variable, which is a bytes object. This is happening in the __init__ method of the XportReader class in the file sas_xport.py.

It seems that the intention is to encode the contents only if it's a string, but the current implementation is trying to encode it regardless.

To fix the bug, the code can be updated to check the type of contents before trying to encode it. If it's a string, then it can be encoded; otherwise, it should be left as is.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method of the XportReader class:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Check if the input is a string before trying to encode it
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        else:
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```
