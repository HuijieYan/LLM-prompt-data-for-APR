Potential error location: The error is occurring in the if-else block where the function reads the contents of the file. The code is attempting to encode ‘contents’ without checking if the contents are of type bytes, leading to the AttributeError.

Reason for the bug: The code does not appropriately handle the case where the input file is a binary file. It attempts to encode the contents of the file unconditionally, which results in the AttributeError when the file is binary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of ‘contents’ before encoding it. If it is not of type bytes, no encoding should be performed.
2. Handle binary files differently from text files. Use ‘rb’ mode while opening, and read the contents accordingly.
3. Ensure that the code works for both text and binary files without throwing any errors related to encoding.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        contents = self.filepath_or_buffer.read()
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
    
    if not isinstance(contents, bytes):
        # If contents are not of type bytes, no encoding is performed
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
    else:
        # If contents are of type bytes, encode using the specified encoding
        try:
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        except UnicodeEncodeError:
            pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```
