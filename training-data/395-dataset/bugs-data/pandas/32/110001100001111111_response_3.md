The error occurs when a file object is passed to the `pd.read_sas` function from GCSFS. The error message `'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'` suggests that there is an issue with handling the file object when encoding is involved.

The potential error location within the `__init__` function of the `sas_xport.py` file is the section where the `open` method is used to open the file when the `filepath_or_buffer` is a string or bytes type. The code then tries to encode the contents and store them in `self.filepath_or_buffer`. This process can lead to the error mentioned.

The error occurs because the code is trying to encode already encoded bytes, or read bytes from a file and then encode them, resulting in a mismatch of data types and encoding.

To fix this bug, we can use the following approach:
1. Check the type of `filepath_or_buffer` first and then handle the file object accordingly.
2. If `filepath_or_buffer` is a string or bytes, read the contents of the file and store them directly in `self.filepath_or_buffer` without encoding them again.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:
```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    with get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding) as (
        filepath_or_buffer,
        encoding,
        compression,
        should_close,
    ):
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            # No need to encode, directly store the contents
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```
This corrected code checks the type of `filepath_or_buffer` and then handles the file object accordingly. It also avoids encoding the contents when unnecessary.
