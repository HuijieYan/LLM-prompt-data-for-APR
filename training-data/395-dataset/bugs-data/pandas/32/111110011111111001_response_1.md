The error is occurring in the __init__ method of the XportReader class. Specifically, the error is happening when attempting to encode the contents of the filepath_or_buffer. The error message indicates that a 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode', which means that the contents variable is already in bytes format and cannot be encoded.

This error occurred because the code attempted to encode the contents of filepath_or_buffer unconditionally, without checking its type or encoding.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to check if the contents are already in bytes format before attempting to encode it. If it is not in bytes format, we can encode it using the specified encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if not isinstance(contents, bytes):
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the filepath_or_buffer is in bytes format. If it is not, we encode it using the specified encoding. If it is already in bytes format, we directly use it for the BytesIO.

This should resolve the encoding issue and prevent the AttributeError.
