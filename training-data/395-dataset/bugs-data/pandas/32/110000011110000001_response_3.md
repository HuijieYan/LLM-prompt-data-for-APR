The error is occurring in the `read_sas` function of the `sasreader.py` file. Specifically, it is happening on line 269, where the `encode` method is being called on the `contents` variable, which is of type `bytes`. This is resulting in an AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'.

The bug is happening because the code assumes that the `contents` variable will always be of type `str`, and tries to encode it using the specified encoding. However, if the `filepath_or_buffer` input is a binary file, then `contents` will be of type `bytes` and cannot be encoded.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to check the type of `contents` before attempting to encode it. If it is of type `str`, then we can proceed with the encoding. If it is of type `bytes`, then we can handle it differently.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:
```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if isinstance(contents, str):
            try:
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```
