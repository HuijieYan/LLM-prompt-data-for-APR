The error occurs in the __init__ function of the XportReader class. The issue arises from the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)` which tries to encode bytes using the value of self._encoding. However, the issue may occur if the contents variable is already in bytes format, as demonstrated in the error message.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code within the else block to handle the case where the filepath_or_buffer is already in bytes format. We can directly assign the contents to the self.filepath_or_buffer without encoding it. This modification will prevent the AttributeError that is currently being raised. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize
    
    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
    
    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, BufferedReader):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
        else:
            # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer.read())
    
    self._read_header()
```
