The error occurs in the `__init__` function of the `XportReader` class of the `sas_xport.py` file. The error message indicates that a 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'. This occurs at the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)`.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is trying to encode the content as per the specified encoding, but since the content is already in bytes format, it cannot be encoded again.

To fix this bug, we should check the type of `filepath_or_buffer` and handle the encoding accordingly. Additionally, we also need to ensure that the file is closed after it has been opened.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    should_close = False

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if should_close:
        with open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb") as file:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = file.read()
    else:
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb").read()
        else:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer.read()

    self._read_header()
```

By using the above correction, we handle the encoding and file reading based on the type of `filepath_or_buffer` and ensure that the file is properly closed after operations are complete.
