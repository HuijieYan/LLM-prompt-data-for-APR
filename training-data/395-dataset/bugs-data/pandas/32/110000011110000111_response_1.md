The error occurs in the `read_sas` function, specifically in the `__init__` method of the `SasReader` class which is called by `read_sas`. The error arises when the `contents` variable is being encoded, even though it's a `bytes` object and not a string.

The reason behind the bug is that the code does not handle the case where the input `filepath_or_buffer` is already a binary file (i.e., a `bytes` object). It assumes that the input will always be a filepath or a string, and doesn't account for the case where it's already a file object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to handle the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is a file object. If it's a file object, we should directly use it, without any further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        filepath_or_buffer, encoding, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Use the file object directly
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

With this correction, the `__init__` method properly handles the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is a file object, and avoids unnecessary encoding operations on `bytes` objects.
