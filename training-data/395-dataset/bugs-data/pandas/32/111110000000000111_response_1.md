Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `__init__` function of the `XportReader` class. Specifically, the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)` is raising an AttributeError because the `contents` object is of type `bytes` and does not have an `encode` method.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the `read_sas` function in pandas is passing a file object of type `bytes` to the `XportReader` class. The `__init__` function of `XportReader` assumes that the input will always be a file path or buffer, and it tries to encode the `contents` object even if it's already of type `bytes`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the type of the `filepath_or_buffer` argument in the `__init__` function and handle the case where it is a file object of type `bytes` differently.
2. Avoid re-encoding the `contents` object if it's already of type `bytes`.

Corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer  # Use the input file object directly

    self._read_header()
```

The corrected code includes a check for whether `filepath_or_buffer` is already a file object of type `bytes`. If it is, then it is used directly without attempting to re-encode its contents.
