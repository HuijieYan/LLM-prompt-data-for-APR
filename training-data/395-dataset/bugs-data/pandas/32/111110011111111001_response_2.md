The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to encode the contents of the filepath_or_buffer. The contents are already in bytes format, so trying to encode them will raise the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary encoding of the contents and modify the function accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize
    
    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer, encoding, compression, should_close
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
    
    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the unnecessary encoding of the contents. Instead, we directly assign the filepath_or_buffer to self.filepath_or_buffer without any modification.

This should resolve the AttributeError issue encountered in the test case.
