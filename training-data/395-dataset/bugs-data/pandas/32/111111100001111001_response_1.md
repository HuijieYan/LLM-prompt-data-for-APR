The potential error location within the __init__ function is where the filepath_or_buffer is being opened as a BufferedReader without error handling or closing the file after use. This could lead to file handling issues and potential memory leaks.

The error occurred because in the __init__ function, the filepath_or_buffer is opened as a BufferedReader without error handling or closing the file after use, which could lead to file handling issues and potential memory leaks.

To fix the bug, error handling and proper file closing should be added to the code. Using a with statement to open the file and ensure it is closed automatically is a good practice.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        with open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb") as file:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = file.read()
            try:
                self.filepath_or_buffer = self.filepath_or_buffer.encode(self._encoding)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        try:
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        except UnicodeEncodeError:
            pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```
