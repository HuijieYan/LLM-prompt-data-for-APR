Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class in the file `sas_xport.py`. Specifically, the error is happening when the `contents` variable is being encoded in the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)`.

Reasons behind the bug: The error message "AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'" suggests that the `contents` variable is already in bytes format and does not need to be encoded again. Therefore, the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)` is causing the issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `contents` is already in bytes format before trying to encode it.
2. If `contents` is not already in bytes format, handle the encoding in a separate branch.
3. Ensure that the code accounts for different data types in the `contents` variable.

Corrected code:
```python
def __init__(self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if isinstance(contents, str):
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```
