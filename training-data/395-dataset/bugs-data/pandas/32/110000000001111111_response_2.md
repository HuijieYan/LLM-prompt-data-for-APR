Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the section of the code where it tries to encode the file contents using the provided encoding. This is indicated by the AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurred because the code is trying to encode the file contents, even though it is already in bytes format. This is causing the AttributeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by checking the type of the contents before trying to encode it. If the contents are already in bytes format, encoding should be skipped.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if isinstance(contents, str):
            try:
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```
