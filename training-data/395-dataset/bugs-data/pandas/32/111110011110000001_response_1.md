The error message indicates an AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode', which suggests that there is an attempt to call the encode method on a bytes object. This occurs in the __init__ method of the XportReader class, specifically in the else block where the contents variable is assigned.

The bug occurs because the code wrongly assumes that the contents variable is always a string and tries to encode it. However, if contents is already of type bytes (as indicated by the error message), then attempting to encode it will result in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the code needs to check the type of contents before attempting to encode it. If contents is already a bytes object, then there is no need to encode it.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method of the XportReader class:

```python
    def __init__(
        self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
    ):
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize
        
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
            (
                filepath_or_buffer,
                encoding,
                compression,
                should_close,
            ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
        
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
        else:
            # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding if contents is bytes
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            if isinstance(contents, str):  # Check if contents is a string
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
        
        self._read_header()
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to see if the contents variable is of type str before trying to encode it. If it's already a bytes object, then it skips the encoding step. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
