The bug is likely located in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class in the `sas_xport.py` file. The specific error mentioned in the issue description is "AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'". This error is likely caused by an attempt to call the `encode` method on a bytes object.

The bug is likely occurring in the following line of code:
```python
contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
```
The variable `contents` is expected to hold a bytes object and calling the `encode` method on it is not valid.

To fix this bug, the `__init__` method needs to be modified to handle the `filepath_or_buffer` differently based on its type. If it's a file path (string), it should open the file and read its contents. If it's an open file object, it should directly read the contents.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        with open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb") as f:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = f.read()
    else:
        # Read the contents of the open file object
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer.read()

    self._read_header()
```

With these changes, the `__init__` method should now correctly handle both file paths and open file objects, and the AttributeError mentioned in the issue should be resolved.
