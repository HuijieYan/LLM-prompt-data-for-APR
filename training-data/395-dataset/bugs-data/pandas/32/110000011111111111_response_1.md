The error occurs due to an AttributeError where the 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'. This happens because the code is trying to encode the contents read from a file, assuming it to be a string, but the contents are in bytes format.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the contents are read as bytes, so we can directly use the bytes without encoding them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize
    
    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        filepath_or_buffer, encoding, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(
            filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding
        )
    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, io.BufferedIOBase):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
        else:
            # Copy to BytesIO
            self.filepath_or_buffer = io.BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer.read())
    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `io.BufferedIOBase` type and directly used the `filepath_or_buffer` if it's of that type. This change ensures that we handle the case when the contents are read as bytes and do not attempt to encode them.
