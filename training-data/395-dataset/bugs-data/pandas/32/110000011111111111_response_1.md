It seems that the issue is occurring in the `read_sas` function when a file object from GCSFS is passed to it. The error indicates that a 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'. This suggests that there might be an issue with encoding when the file is being read.

Based on the error message and the test case provided, it seems that the bug is located in the `read_sas` function, specifically in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class. The issue is likely related to the encoding of the contents of the file when it is being read.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the content encoding in a way that is compatible with different types of file objects, including those from GCSFS. This might involve detecting the type of file object being passed and handling the content accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Ensure no encoding for non-file objects
        if hasattr(filepath_or_buffer, 'read'):
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        else:
            contents = filepath_or_buffer
        try:
            if isinstance(contents, str):
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        except UnicodeEncodeError:
            pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `filepath_or_buffer` is a file object with the `read` attribute. If it is, we read its contents; otherwise, we assume it's already the content itself. Then we handle the encoding based on the type of the contents. This should address the issue with encoding and ensure compatibility with file objects from GCSFS.
