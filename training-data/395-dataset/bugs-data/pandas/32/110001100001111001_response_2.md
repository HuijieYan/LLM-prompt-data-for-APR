Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the __init__ function where the filepath_or_buffer is being handled.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be due to handling the filepath_or_buffer variable. The code tries to open the file if it is of type str or bytes, but it doesn't handle the case where the filepath_or_buffer is already a file object (BufferedReader).

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to check if the filepath_or_buffer is already a file object and handle it accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
from io import BytesIO

# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_32/pandas/io/sas/sas_xport.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _read_header(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def read(self, nrows=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass



# this is the corrected function
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Check if filepath_or_buffer is already a file object, if yes, use it directly
        if hasattr(filepath_or_buffer, "read"):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
        else:
            # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
            contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
            try:
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```
In the corrected code, we added a check to see if filepath_or_buffer is already a file object. If it is, we use it directly. If not, we handle it as before.
