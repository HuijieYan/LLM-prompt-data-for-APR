Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the `__init__` function of the `XportReader` class. Specifically, the problem arises when attempting to encode the contents of the file. 

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs when trying to encode the contents of the file. This is because the file is already read in binary mode ("rb") and is not a string that can be encoded. 

Approach for fixing the bug: The file should be read in binary mode ("rb"), and the condition to encode the contents should be checked to handle the encoding error properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        if isinstance(contents, str):
            try:
                contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

By checking the type of `contents` before trying to encode it, the bug can be fixed. This way, it won't attempt to encode the bytes content of the file.
