The error occurs at the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)` in the `__init__` method of the `XportReader` class in the `sas_xport.py` file. The error is caused because the variable `contents` is of type `bytes` and the `encode` method is being called on it, but `bytes` objects do not have an `encode` method.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is already a file-like object, in which case we should directly assign it to `self.filepath_or_buffer`, without manipulating its encoding.

Here's the corrected version of the `__init__` method:
```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):

    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        filepath_or_buffer, encoding, compression, should_close = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer

    self._read_header()
```

With this fix, we handle cases where `filepath_or_buffer` is a file path or an already opened file-like object, and we avoid unnecessary encoding manipulation on file-like objects. This should resolve the error encountered when reading a file object from GCSFS.
