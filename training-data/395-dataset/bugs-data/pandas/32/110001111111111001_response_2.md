The error occurs due to the wrong handling of a specific data type within the `_init_` method of the XportReader class. The error message indicates that a bytes object, which was read from `filepath_or_buffer`, does not have an `encode` attribute. This is due to the fact that bytes objects in Python do not have an `encode` method, as they are already in a binary format.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_init_` method such that if the `filepath_or_buffer` is an instance of bytes, it is directly used as the `filepath_or_buffer` attribute without attempting to encode it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_init_` method:

```python
def __init__(self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
            filepath_or_buffer,
            encoding,
            compression,
            should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
    elif isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, bytes):  # Check if filepath_or_buffer is bytes
        # Use the bytes object directly
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(filepath_or_buffer)
    else:
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")

    self._read_header()
```

With this correction, the code will now correctly handle the case when `filepath_or_buffer` is a bytes object, which does not need to be encoded, and avoid the AttributeError.
