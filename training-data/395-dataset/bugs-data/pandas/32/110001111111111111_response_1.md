1. The test case involves reading a SAS file as a binary file and comparing it with a CSV file. The error message indicates that there is an attribute error when encoding the contents of the file, specifically with the line `contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the section where the contents of the file are attempted to be encoded using the specified encoding.

3. The error occurs because the contents of the file are being re-encoded even though it is already a binary file, leading to the attribute error. The code is treating the binary file as if it were a text file that needs to be encoded.

4. To fix the bug, we should handle the binary and text file cases separately to ensure that the contents of the file are processed appropriately based on their type. For text files, we need to handle the encoding, while for binary files, no encoding should be applied.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        (
        filepath_or_buffer,
        encoding,
        compression,
        should_close,
        ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
        self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
    else:
        # Handle binary file
        if hasattr(filepath_or_buffer, "read") and hasattr(filepath_or_buffer, "seek"):
            # Reset the file pointer to the beginning
            filepath_or_buffer.seek(0)
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported file type.")

    self._read_header()
```

In the corrected code, we handle the binary file case separately by checking if the `filepath_or_buffer` has `read` and `seek` attributes. If it does, then it is treated as a binary file and the file pointer is reset to the beginning. If it does not, a ValueError is raised for an unsupported file type. This approach ensures that the contents of the file are processed appropriately based on their type.
