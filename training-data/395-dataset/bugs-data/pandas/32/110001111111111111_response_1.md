The error occurs when the `read_sas` function is called with a file object. The `read_sas` function initializes an `XportReader` object, which calls the `__init__` method. Inside the `__init__` method, there is an attempt to encode a `bytes` object directly which causes the `AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'encode'`.

To fix this bug, we need to check the type of the `filepath_or_buffer` and handle it accordingly. If it's a file path, we need to open the file and read it as `bytes`. If it's already a file object, we should read its contents, convert them to `bytes`, and then initialize `self.filepath_or_buffer` using `BytesIO`.

Here's the corrected `__init__` method for the `XportReader` class:

```python
def __init__(
    self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
):
    self._encoding = encoding
    self._lines_read = 0
    self._index = index
    self._chunksize = chunksize

    if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, str):
        with open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb") as file:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = file.read()
    else:
        # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
        contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
        try:
            contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
        except UnicodeEncodeError:
            pass
        self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)

    self._read_header()
```

With this correction, the `__init__` method now handles both file paths and file objects, ensuring that the input is read as `bytes` and can be encoded without raising an error.
