The error occurs when the `read_sas` function is passed a file object from GCSFS, and the `read_sas` function fails to open this file and read its contents.

The potential error location is within the `__init__` function of the `XportReader` class, specifically in the handling of `filepath_or_buffer`. When `filepath_or_buffer` is a file object from GCSFS, the function fails to handle it properly.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the `filepath_or_buffer` is a string or bytes path to a file, and it doesn't account for the case where it is a file object like the one returned by GCSFS.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case where `filepath_or_buffer` is already a file object. It should not attempt to open the file again, but instead use the provided file object directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(
        self, filepath_or_buffer, index=None, encoding="ISO-8859-1", chunksize=None
    ):
    
        self._encoding = encoding
        self._lines_read = 0
        self._index = index
        self._chunksize = chunksize
    
        if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
            (
                filepath_or_buffer,
                encoding,
                compression,
                should_close,
            ) = get_filepath_or_buffer(filepath_or_buffer, encoding=encoding)
    
            if isinstance(filepath_or_buffer, (str, bytes)):
                self.filepath_or_buffer = open(filepath_or_buffer, "rb")
            else:
                # Copy to BytesIO, and ensure no encoding
                contents = filepath_or_buffer.read()
                try:
                    contents = contents.encode(self._encoding)
                except UnicodeEncodeError:
                    pass
                self.filepath_or_buffer = BytesIO(contents)
        else:
            self.filepath_or_buffer = filepath_or_buffer
    
        self._read_header()
```
