The potential error location within the problematic `cut` function is likely to be in the logic for handling non-iterable `bins`. The bug might be related to the input validation for checking if `bins` is a scalar, and the subsequent handling of `bins` when it's a scalar.

The bug is likely to occur when the input `bins` is validated as a non-iterable scalar, and the subsequent logic to handle scalar `bins` is not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, the input validation for scalar `bins` should be reviewed to ensure it properly handles scalar inputs and the subsequent logic to handle scalar `bins` should also be thoroughly tested to ensure it behaves as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `cut` function:

```python
import numpy as np
# previous imports have been omitted for brevity

def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):

    # ... rest of the function body remains unchanged from the original implementation ...

    if not np.iterable(bins) and not isinstance(bins, IntervalIndex):
        if not isinstance(bins, int) or bins < 1:
            raise ValueError("`bins` should be a positive integer.")

        sz = len(x)

        if sz == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot cut empty array")

        rng = (nanops.nanmin(x), nanops.nanmax(x))
        mn, mx = [mi + 0.0 for mi in rng]

        if np.isinf(mn) or np.isinf(mx):
            raise ValueError("cannot specify integer `bins` when input data contains infinity")
        elif mn == mx:
            mn_adjustment = 0.001 * abs(mn) if mn != 0 else 0.001
            mn -= mn_adjustment
            mx += 0.001 * abs(mx) if mx != 0 else 0.001
            bins = np.linspace(mn, mx, bins + 1, endpoint=True)
        else:
            bins = np.linspace(mn, mx, bins + 1, endpoint=True)
            adj = (mx - mn) * 0.001  # 0.1% of the range
            if right:
                bins[0] -= adj
            else:
                bins[-1] += adj

    # ... rest of the function body remains unchanged from the original implementation ...
```

In the corrected code, the validation for a non-iterable scalar `bins` input has been updated to raise a `ValueError` if `bins` is not an integer or not a positive value. The subsequent logic to handle scalar `bins` has also been modified to ensure proper adjustments to the bins based on the input data range.
