The potential error in the function seems to be in the binning logic. The "bins" parameter is expected to be an integer or a sequence of scalars, but it seems that the function is not handling list inputs correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be the mishandling of list inputs for the "bins" parameter. The function expects a scalar or an array-like input, but it seems to be processing lists as well, resulting in unexpected behavior.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic for handling the "bins" parameter to correctly process list inputs. This could involve converting the list to an array or handling it as a sequence of scalars.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    # handle input bins if it is a list
    if isinstance(bins, list):
        bins = np.array(bins)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return _postprocess_for_cut(fac, bins, retbins, dtype, original)
```
