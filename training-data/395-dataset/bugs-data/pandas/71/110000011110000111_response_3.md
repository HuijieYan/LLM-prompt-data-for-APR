The error is occurring during the `searchsorted()` method within the `_bins_to_cuts` function. This error is likely due to the presence of NaN (Not a Number) values in the input series `a`.

The `searchsorted()` method does not handle NaN values. Since the input series contains NaN values, this could lead to the "boolean value of NA is ambiguous" error.

To fix this bug, the NaN values need to be handled before passing the input series to the `searchsorted()` method.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    x = pd.array(x, dtype="Int64")
    result = pd.cut(
        x[~pd.isna(x)],  # Remove NaN values
        bins,
        right=right,
        labels=labels,
        retbins=retbins,
        precision=precision,
        include_lowest=include_lowest,
        duplicates=duplicates
    )

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return result
```

In the corrected function, we use the `pd.array()` method to convert the input `x` to a pandas array and then use the `pd.isna()` method to filter out the NaN values before passing the values to `pd.cut()`.

This approach ensures that the NaN values are handled before performing the operation that caused the error.
