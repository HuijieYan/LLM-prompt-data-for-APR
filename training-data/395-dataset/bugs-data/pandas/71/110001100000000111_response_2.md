Potential error location: The potential error could be caused by the incorrect handling of non-iterable bins.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might occur due to the mishandling of non-iterable bins, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to cast non-iterable bins to arrays.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check for non-iterable bins and handle them appropriately.
- Validate the input bins before processing to avoid unexpected behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas.api.extensions as pdext
from pandas.api.types import is_scalar, is_datetime64tz_dtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import _NS_DTYPE
from pandas.core.arrays import Categorical
from pandas.core.arrays.categorical import factorize
from pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes import IntervalDtype, CategoricalDtype
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import notna
from pandas.core.dtypes.missing import nanops

# ... (omitted code) ...

# this is the fixed function
def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    # NOTE: this binning code is changed a bit from histogram for var(x) == 0

    # for handling the cut for datetime and timedelta objects
    original = x
    x = _preprocess_for_cut(x)
    x, dtype = _coerce_to_type(x)

    if not np.iterable(bins):
        bins = [bins]  # Convert non-iterable bins to a list

    # rest of the function remains the same as the original
```
