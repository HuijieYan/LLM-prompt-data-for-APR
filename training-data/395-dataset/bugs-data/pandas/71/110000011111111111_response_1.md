The error "TypeError: boolean value of NA is ambiguous" occurs in the function `cut` from the module `pandas.core.reshape.tile`. The error is raised when the `searchsorted` method is called on `bins` with the `side` parameter in the `_bins_to_cuts` function.

The error occurs due to the presence of missing values (NA) in the input array `x`. The `searchsorted` method encounters issues when trying to handle missing values, leading to the ambiguous boolean value error.

To fix this issue, the missing values should be handled appropriately to avoid the ambiguity in the boolean comparison during the searchsorted operation.

Here's the corrected function for the `cut` method, including handling for missing values:

```python
def cut(
    x,
    bins,
    right: bool = True,
    labels=None,
    retbins: bool = False,
    precision: int = 3,
    include_lowest: bool = False,
    duplicates: str = "raise",
):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # Handle missing values
    no_missing = pd.notna(x)
    x_no_missing = x[no_missing]
    fac_no_missing, bins = _bins_to_cuts(
        x_no_missing,
        bins,
        right=right,
        labels=labels,
        precision=precision,
        include_lowest=include_lowest,
        dtype=dtype,
        duplicates=duplicates,
    )

    fac = np.empty(len(x), dtype='O')
    fac[no_missing] = fac_no_missing
    fac[~no_missing] = pd.NA

    return fac
```

In this corrected code, missing values are first handled by separating the input into non-missing and missing values. The `searchsorted` operation is performed only on the non-missing values, and then the results are combined with the missing values to return the final output. This approach avoids the ambiguity in boolean comparisons caused by missing values.
