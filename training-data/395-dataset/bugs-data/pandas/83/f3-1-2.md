Code Sample
import pandas as pd
print(pd.__version__)  # '0.25.3'

# simple frame with a name attribute for columns
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1.1], 'b': [2.2]})
df.columns.name = 'x'
print(df)
# x    a    b
# 0  1.1  2.2

# tile rows to a new frame, apparently using the copy of the first frame
df2 = pd.concat([df] * 2, copy=True)
print(df2)
# x    a    b
# 0  1.1  2.2
# 0  1.1  2.2

# clear the column name for the first frame
df.columns.name = None

# and observe the name for the second
assert df2.columns.name is None
print(df2)
#      a    b
# 0  1.1  2.2
# 0  1.1  2.2

# aha, it's the same object
assert df.columns is df2.columns
Problem description
It is expected that copy=True should make a copy of the columns index. However, the demonstration shows it's the same object. Modifications, such as the name property, are made to the source frame and the output frame created by pd.concat.

Expected Output
It is expected that df2.columns is a copy of the original df.columns. This would prevent (e.g.) changing the name property for both frames.

A workaround is to manually copy this property after pd.concat:

df2 = pd.concat([df] * 2, copy=True)
df2.columns = df2.columns.copy()
```
