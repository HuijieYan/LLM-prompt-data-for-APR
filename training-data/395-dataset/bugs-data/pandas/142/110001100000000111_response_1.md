Potential Error Location:
The issue is occurring in the `diff` function, where the subtraction operation `arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]` is giving unexpected results when the input is a boolean array.

Explanation of Bug:
The bug is happening because the current implementation of `pd.Series.diff` uses `algorithms.diff`, which subtracts two numpy arrays in a way that is not consistent with native Python operations. This inconsistency is leading to unexpected results, especially when dealing with boolean values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One approach to fix the bug is to modify the subtraction operation in the `diff` function to handle boolean values more consistently and produce the expected results. Additionally, considering the deprecation warning about the use of native boolean operations in numpy, it may be necessary to update the operation using the recommended bitwise_xor or logical_xor function.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    dtype = arr.dtype

    if arr.dtype == np.bool:
        out_arr = arr.astype(np.int) - arr.shift(n).astype(np.int)
    else:
        out_arr = arr - arr.shift(n)

    return out_arr
```
