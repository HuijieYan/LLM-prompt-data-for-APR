The error occurs because the buggy function `diff` tries to perform boolean subtraction using the `-` operator, which is not supported in numpy for boolean arrays. The error message specifically mentions that "numpy boolean subtract is not supported" and suggests using bitwise_xor, the `^` operator, or the logical_xor function instead.

To fix this, the `diff` function should be modified to handle boolean arrays differently. The function should use `logical_xor` or bitwise_xor instead of the `-` operator when dealing with boolean arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.bool_):
        out_arr = np.where(n >= 0, np.logical_xor(arr, np.roll(arr, n, axis)), np.logical_xor(arr, np.roll(arr, n, axis)))

    else:
        out_arr = np.diff(arr, n, axis)

    return out_arr
```

In this corrected code, the `if` statement checks whether the dtype of the array is a boolean type. If it is, the `np.logical_xor` function is used to perform the difference operation. If the dtype is not boolean, the function falls back to using `np.diff` to calculate the difference. This approach ensures that the correct operation is performed based on the type of the input array.
