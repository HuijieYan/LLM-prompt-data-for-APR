The error message is indicating a TypeError: numpy boolean subtract, the '-' operator, is not supported. This means that the current implementation of the diff function in pandas is trying to perform a subtraction operation on boolean values using the '-' operator, which is not supported in numpy for boolean arrays.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the line:

```python
out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]
```

This line is trying to perform a subtraction operation on boolean arrays, which is not supported in numpy.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are that the diff function is not handling boolean arrays correctly. The subtraction operation on boolean arrays should be different from the standard arithmetic subtraction, but the current implementation is not taking this into account.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle boolean arrays differently. Instead of using the '-' operator for subtraction, we can use the bitwise_xor, the '^' operator, to achieve the desired diff functionality for boolean arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the diff function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=arr.dtype)
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    
    if is_bool_dtype(out_arr.dtype):
        out_arr = np.bitwise_xor(arr[res_indexer], arr[lag_indexer])
    else:
        out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    
    return out_arr
```

The correction involves checking if the dtype of the array is boolean, and then using np.bitwise_xor instead of the subtraction operator to perform the diff operation. This change will ensure that the diff function works correctly for boolean arrays.
