The bug occurs in the `diff` function. The function is intended to calculate the difference between an array and the same array shifted by `n` positions. However, when dealing with boolean arrays, the subtraction operation does not behave as expected. This is due to the way boolean values are handled in NumPy.

To fix the bug, the subtraction operation for boolean arrays needs to be handled differently. We can follow the approach suggested in the GitHub issue, using bitwise_xor or logical_xor instead of the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    is_timedelta = False
    if needs_i8_conversion(arr):
        dtype = np.float64
        arr = arr.view("i8")
        na = iNaT
        is_timedelta = True

    elif is_bool_dtype(dtype):
        arr_shifted = np.roll(arr, n, axis)
        out_arr = np.bitwise_xor(arr, arr_shifted)
        return out_arr

    elif is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        dtype = np.float64

    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = na

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    return out_arr
```

By using `np.bitwise_xor`, the subtraction of boolean arrays is handled as bitwise XOR operations, which aligns with the behavior expected in the context of boolean differences.
