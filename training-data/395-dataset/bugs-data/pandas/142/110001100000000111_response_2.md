Based on the issue title and description, it seems that the problem lies in the behavior of boolean values when using the `diff` method. The current implementation subtracts two numpy arrays directly, which causes unexpected behavior with boolean values.

The bug occurs because the implementation of the `diff` method in the provided code subtracts two arrays directly, which doesn't handle boolean values as expected. The expected behavior of subtracting boolean values in Python is to treat `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`, but the current implementation is not consistent with this behavior.

To fix the bug, the `diff` method should be updated to handle boolean values correctly, perhaps by using a custom implementation for boolean subtraction. Another approach would be to utilize the `np.diff` function, which treats boolean values as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n, axis=axis)

    return out_arr
```

In the corrected code, the `np.diff` function is used to handle the subtraction of numpy arrays, which includes handling boolean values as expected. This approach should ensure consistent behavior when using the `diff` method with boolean values.
