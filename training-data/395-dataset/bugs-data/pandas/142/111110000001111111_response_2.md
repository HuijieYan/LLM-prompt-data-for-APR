Potential Error Location:
The issue lies in the section of the code where the difference between the shifted and the original array is calculated. It seems that the code misunderstands the expected behavior of subtraction with boolean values, which is causing the difference between `x - x.shift()` and `x.diff()` to provide different results.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the subtraction operation for boolean values in the current implementation is not following the native Python behavior. The current implementation is treating the boolean values as 0 and 1, leading to unexpected results when performing subtraction.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use np.diff instead of the current implementation for calculating differences.
2. Adapt the subtraction operation for boolean values to follow native Python behavior, where `True - False` results in 1 and `False - True` results in -1.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    # Checking if the input array is a pandas Series
    if isinstance(arr, pd.Series):
        return arr.diff(periods=n, axis=axis)

    # Perform the subtraction operation for non-pandas Series arrays
    return np.diff(arr, n, axis=axis)
``` 

In the corrected code, the `diff` function now first checks if the input `arr` is a pandas Series. If it is, it directly uses the `diff` method of the Series with the specified periods and axis. Otherwise, it uses the `np.diff` function to calculate the differences for non-Series arrays. This approach ensures that the correct behavior is followed for both pandas Series and other array-like objects.
