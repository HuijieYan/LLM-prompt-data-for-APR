Analyzing the provided function, it seems that the issue arises from the code converting boolean values to 0 and 1 when performing operations. This conversion causes unexpected behavior when using the `diff` function with boolean values.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle boolean values separately, rather than converting them to a different data type and performing arithmetic operations on them.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    Difference of n between self, analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    dtype = arr.dtype
    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = np.nan

    if is_bool_dtype(arr.dtype):
        res = arr.astype(float)
        lag = arr.shift(n).astype(float)

        out_arr[axis][n:] = res[n:] - lag[:-n]

    else:
        res = np.roll(arr, n, axis=axis)
        out_arr[axis] = arr - res

    return out_arr
```

In this corrected code, we handle boolean arrays separately by converting them into float arrays for performing arithmetic operations. For non-boolean arrays, we use `np.roll` to achieve the same behavior as shifting, and then subtract the shifted array from the original array. This approach ensures consistent behavior across different data types when computing differences.
