Potential error location:
The issue seems to be within the calculation of `out_arr` inside the `diff` function. When dealing with boolean values, the subtraction operation is causing unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `diff` function does not handle boolean values properly when subtracting arrays.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, the implementation of the subtraction operation for boolean arrays should be adjusted so that it aligns with the expected behavior of native Python boolean operations.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = na

    if arr.dtype == np.bool_:
        out_arr[axis] = arr.astype(int) - arr.shift(n).astype(int)
    else:
        out_arr[axis] = arr - arr.shift(n)

    return out_arr
```
With this correction, the function now explicitly handles boolean arrays by first casting them to integer arrays before subtraction, which aligns with the expected behavior of native Python boolean operations.
