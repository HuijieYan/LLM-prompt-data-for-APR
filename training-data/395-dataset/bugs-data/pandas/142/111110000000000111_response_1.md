The issue is that when using the `diff` function on a boolean array, the result is different from using the `shift` function. The current implementation is performing array subtraction, which causes the discrepancy due to the way NumPy treats boolean arrays in binary operations.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the block of code:
```python
out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]
```

The reason behind the bug is that the current implementation of the `diff` function is performing direct array subtraction for boolean arrays, whereas the expected behavior would be to treat True as 1 and False as 0, and then perform subtraction for boolean arrays.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include using a different approach to handle boolean arrays, such as treating True as 1 and False as 0, or using the `np.diff` function which treats boolean arrays as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n, axis)
    return out_arr
```
