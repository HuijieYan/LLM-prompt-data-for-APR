Potential error location:
The problematic code seems to be at the line `out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]` where it is attempting to subtract boolean arrays.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation of the `diff` function uses `arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]` to subtract boolean arrays, which is not consistent with regular Python behavior for boolean subtraction.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to use the `np.diff` function, which treats boolean arrays consistently with regular Python behavior (replacing False with 0 and True with 1). This will align the behavior of the `diff` function with the expected output for boolean subtraction.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n, axis=axis)

    return out_arr
```
In the corrected code, we use `np.diff` to calculate the differences between elements of the input array. This aligns the behavior of the function with the expected output for boolean subtraction and removes the bug present in the original code.
