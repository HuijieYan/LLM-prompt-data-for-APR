The issue arises from the use of the `diff` function in pandas when the input array has a dtype of boolean. In this case, the current implementation of the `diff` function calculates the difference between `arr[res_indexer]` and `arr[lag_indexer]` directly, which leads to a different result than when using the native Python calculations or `np.diff`.

To fix this bug, the `diff` function should handle boolean arrays differently and potentially use a method like `np.diff` to get the desired behavior for boolean arrays.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    if arr.dtype == bool:
        return arr.astype(int).diff(periods=n, axis=axis).astype(bool)

    return arr.diff(periods=n, axis=axis)
```

In this corrected implementation, if the input array has a dtype of boolean, it first converts the boolean values to integers using `arr.astype(int)`, then applies the `diff` function from pandas, and finally converts the result back to boolean using `.astype(bool)`. This will ensure that the behavior of the `diff` function is consistent across different data types.
