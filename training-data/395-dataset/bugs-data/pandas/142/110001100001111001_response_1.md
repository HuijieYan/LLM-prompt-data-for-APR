The buggy function `diff` is supposed to calculate the difference of `n` between the elements of the input array `arr`. It considers different data types and handles them accordingly, such as boolean, integer, timedelta, etc.

The issue seems to be with the handling of boolean dtype. The function needs to be updated to handle boolean dtype correctly.

Based on the provided test case:
- The input array `arr` has a boolean dtype.
- The input parameter `n` has a value of `1`.
- The axis value is `0`.
- The array `arr` has a shape of `(5,)` and a dimension of `1`.

As for the variables:
- `na` is the nan value.
- `dtype` is the data type of the array.
- `is_timedelta` is a flag to check if the array has a timedelta data type.
- Others are variables related to indexing and assignment within the function.

To fix the issue, the function needs to handle boolean dtype correctly, ensuring that the boolean dtype is appropriately converted and processed for the difference calculation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    if dtype == 'bool':
        # Convert boolean dtype to int
        arr = arr.astype(int)

    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = na

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    return out_arr
```

In the corrected function, we added a specific check for boolean dtype and converted it to an integer before performing the difference calculation.
