Potential Error Location: The error seems to be related to the subtraction operation in the `diff` function for boolean values.

Reasons behind the Bug: The current implementation of the `diff` function subtracts two numpy arrays directly, which can lead to unexpected behavior with boolean values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The `diff` function should be modified to handle boolean values differently. One possible approach is to convert the boolean values to integers (0 for False, 1 for True) before performing the subtraction.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    if dtype == bool:
        arr = arr.astype(int)

    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n, axis=axis)

    if dtype == bool:
        out_arr = out_arr.astype(bool)

    return out_arr
