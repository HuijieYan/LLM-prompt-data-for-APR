The bug occurs in the `diff` function of the provided source code. The issue arises because when the dtype of the input array is boolean, the function subtracts the lagged array from the original array in a way that doesn't match the expected behavior of boolean subtraction and doesn't align with the behavior of `np.diff`.

The correct approach would be to utilize `np.diff` for boolean arrays, as it handles boolean operations in a way that aligns with native Python behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n, axis)

    return out_arr
```

By using `np.diff` directly, we can ensure that the subtraction operation follows the expected behavior for boolean arrays and aligns with the behavior of native Python for boolean subtraction.
