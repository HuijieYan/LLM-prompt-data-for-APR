The issue is with the subtraction of boolean values in the `algorithms.diff` function. Currently, the logic performs subtraction using the `-` operator directly, which is not supported for boolean arrays in NumPy. This results in a `TypeError` during the subtraction operation.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for performing the subtraction of boolean arrays. We can use the `logical_xor` function from NumPy to perform the subtraction of boolean arrays while addressing the deprecation warning.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    # Existing code remains unchanged

    if is_timedelta:
        # Previous code for boolean subtraction
        # out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]

        # Updated code for boolean subtraction using logical_xor
        out_arr[res_indexer] = np.logical_xor(arr[res_indexer], arr[lag_indexer]).astype(np.float)

    # Rest of the existing logic remains unchanged

    return out_arr
```

By utilizing the `np.logical_xor` function, we can address the deprecation warning and handle the boolean array subtraction correctly, making the `diff` function work as expected for boolean arrays.
