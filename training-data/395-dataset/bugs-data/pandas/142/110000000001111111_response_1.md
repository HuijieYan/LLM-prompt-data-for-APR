The bug is located in the `diff` function at the subtraction operation when `arr` has a boolean dtype. The current implementation does not handle boolean subtraction in the same way as native Python, leading to unexpected behavior.

The reason for the bug is that the current implementation uses regular arithmetic subtraction (`-`) on boolean arrays, which is deprecated in NumPy. This leads to different results compared to native Python boolean subtraction.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) instead of regular subtraction for boolean arrays in the `diff` function. This would align the behavior with native Python boolean operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    if dtype == np.bool:
        out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=np.object_)
        shifted_arr = np.roll(arr, n, axis=axis)
        out_arr = arr ^ shifted_arr
    else:
        out_arr = np.diff(arr, n=n, axis=axis)

    return out_arr
```

In this corrected code, I have used the `^` operator (bitwise XOR) for boolean arrays in the `diff` function. For non-boolean arrays, the code uses `np.diff` to compute the differences. This approach aligns the behavior of boolean subtraction with native Python boolean operations and avoids any numpy deprecation warnings.
