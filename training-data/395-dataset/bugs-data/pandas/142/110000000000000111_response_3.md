Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the part of the code where boolean arrays are being manipulated, specifically in the line `out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]`. 

Reasons behind the bug: The current implementation of the function `diff` is using an algorithm that subtracts two numpy arrays, but numpy's treatment of booleans in binary operations differs from native Python. This causes the `diff` function to provide different results than expected when operating on boolean arrays.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: A possible approach to fix the bug is to avoid using the `-` operator directly on boolean arrays and instead use bitwise operations, logical operations, or the `np.logical_xor` function as recommended in the deprecation warning.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """
    if isinstance(arr, pd.Series):
        return arr.diff(periods=n)
    else:
        return np.diff(arr, n=n, axis=axis)
```
