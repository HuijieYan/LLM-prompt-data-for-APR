The bug occurs in the `diff` function in the conditional block when `is_bool_dtype(dtype)` is `True`. The function tries to handle boolean dtype separately, but the implementation is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior when subtracting boolean arrays.

The reason behind the bug is that the implementation of handling boolean dtype in the `diff` function is not following the expected behavior of boolean subtraction. 

To fix the bug, we can modify the way boolean dtype is handled in the `diff` function. Instead of trying to handle boolean arrays separately, we can convert boolean arrays to integer arrays before performing the subtraction.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    dtype = arr.dtype

    if is_bool_dtype(dtype):
        arr = arr.astype(int)  # Convert boolean array to integer array
        dtype = np.int64

    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = np.nan

    # Perform subtraction on the arrays (now either integer or float)
    out_arr = np.diff(arr, n=n, axis=axis)

    return out_arr
```

In the corrected code:
- We check if the dtype of the array is boolean and convert it to an integer array using `arr.astype(int)`.
- We then use `np.diff` to calculate the difference between elements of the array along a given axis.

This correction ensures that the behavior of subtracting boolean arrays aligns with the expected behavior of boolean subtraction.
