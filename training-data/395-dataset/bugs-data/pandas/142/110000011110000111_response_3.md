The error occurs because the code is attempting to perform subtraction on boolean values in the function `diff()`, which is not supported in the current implementation using the `-` operator.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `diff()` function to address the subtraction of boolean values.

Here's the corrected code for the `diff()` function:

```python
def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    n = int(n)
    dtype = arr.dtype

    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = np.nan

    res = arr
    lag = np.roll(arr, -n, axis=axis)
    result = np.where(res == lag, np.nan, res)

    return result
```

In this corrected version of the function, we use `np.roll()` to shift the array by `n` periods, and then use `np.where()` to compare the elements of the original and shifted arrays. If the elements are the same, we replace the value with `np.nan`. This approach avoids the subtraction of boolean values.

With this corrected function, the test case provided in the question should work without issues.
