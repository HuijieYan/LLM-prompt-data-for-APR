Error location:
The error is likely associated with the conversion of the input array to a specific data type causing issues in performing the difference calculation. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is converting the input array to specific data types like np.float64 and np.object_ based on certain conditions. This could lead to unintended changes in the input array's content or structure, leading to errors in the difference calculation.
2. The implementation involves handling special cases for certain data types and operations, but this logic may not cover all possible scenarios, leading to errors in some cases.
3. There are multiple checks for data type and special cases in the function, making it complex and prone to errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Avoid unnecessary data type conversions and use the input array's original data type for calculations.
2. Simplify the logic for handling special cases and data type conversions to make the function more robust and easier to maintain.
3. Ensure that all edge cases are properly handled and tested to prevent errors in specific scenarios.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype
    out_arr = arr.copy()  # Create a copy of the input array to avoid unintended changes

    out_arr = np.roll(out_arr, shift=-n, axis=axis)  # Use np.roll for shifting the array elements

    return arr - out_arr  # Calculate the difference between the original and shifted arrays to get the desired result
