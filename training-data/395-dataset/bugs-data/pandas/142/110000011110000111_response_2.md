The test case "test_bool_diff" is encountering a TypeError when calling the `diff` method on a boolean Series. The error message indicates that the subtraction of boolean values is not supported in NumPy.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the subtraction of arrays is performed:
```python
out_arr[res_indexer] = arr[res_indexer] - arr[lag_indexer]
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the NumPy array subtraction operator (`-`) does not support boolean values. It is not possible to perform arithmetic operations such as subtraction directly on boolean arrays using the `-` operator.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the problematic function is provided below.

```python
import numpy as np

def diff(arr, n: int, axis: int = 0):
    """
    difference of n between self,
    analogous to s-s.shift(n)

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    n : int
        number of periods
    axis : int
        axis to shift on

    Returns
    -------
    shifted
    """

    n = int(n)
    na = np.nan
    dtype = arr.dtype

    is_timedelta = False
    if needs_i8_conversion(arr):
        dtype = np.float64
        arr = arr.view("i8")
        na = iNaT
        is_timedelta = True

    elif is_bool_dtype(dtype):
        dtype = np.object_

    elif is_integer_dtype(dtype):
        dtype = np.float64

    dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
    out_arr = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)

    na_indexer = [slice(None)] * arr.ndim
    na_indexer[axis] = slice(None, n) if n >= 0 else slice(n, None)
    out_arr[tuple(na_indexer)] = na

    if arr.ndim == 2 and arr.dtype.name in _diff_special:
        f = _diff_special[arr.dtype.name]
        f(arr, out_arr, n, axis)
    else:
        out_arr[res_indexer] = np.diff(arr, n=n, axis=axis)

    if is_timedelta:
        out_arr = out_arr.astype("int64").view("timedelta64[ns]")

    return out_arr
```

In the corrected code, the problematic line that performed subtraction directly on boolean arrays has been replaced with the use of numpy's `np.diff` function, which handles boolean arrays properly. This approach resolves the bug and ensures that the `diff` function supports boolean Series.
