The buggy function seems to be a method of a class (possibly `Block` class) used for setting an item at a specific index.

Based on the analysis of the test case, the potential error is likely to be in the conditional statement that evaluates the length and size of the `arr_value` to decide whether to cast the `values` to the resultant dtype.

The main reason for the bug is that the logic for deciding whether to cast the `values` to the resultant dtype based on the size and shape of `arr_value` is not properly handling the edge cases, leading to incorrect dtype casting.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement for checking the size and shape of `arr_value` can be revised to check whether the size and shape of `arr_value` match the size and shape of `indexer` or not.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def setitem(self, indexer, value):
    """
    Set the value inplace, returning a maybe different typed block.

    Parameters
    ----------
    indexer : tuple, list-like, array-like, slice
        The subset of self.values to set
    value : object
        The value being set

    Returns
    -------
    Block

    Notes
    -----
    `indexer` is a direct slice/positional indexer. `value` must
    be a compatible shape.
    """
    transpose = self.ndim == 2

    # ... (code for coercing and dtype handling)

    # length checking
    check_setitem_lengths(indexer, value, values)

    if is_empty_indexer(indexer, arr_value):  # GH#8669 empty indexers
        pass
    elif is_scalar_indexer(indexer, arr_value):  # setting a single element for each dim and with a rhs that could be e.g. a list; see GH#6043
        values[indexer] = value
    else:
        values[indexer] = value
    
    if transpose:
        values = values.T
    block = self.make_block(values)
    return block
```

In the corrected code, the logic for checking the size and shape of `arr_value` has been replaced with a simpler conditional statement handling different cases of indexer. This should address the issue and provide a more robust handling of the dtype casting.
