The bug exists in the logic that handles the dtype conversion when assigning a categorical value to the block. In the buggy function, there are multiple dtype conversions and checks happening, which seem to be causing the issue.

The bug occurs because the dtype is being checked and converted in several places and there seems to be some redundancy in the logic, leading to potential conflicts and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to simplify the logic for dtype conversion and assignment. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the dtype conversion is applied consistently without unnecessary redundancy.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def setitem(self, indexer, value):
    """
    Set the value inplace, returning a maybe different typed block.

    Parameters
    ----------
    indexer : tuple, list-like, array-like, slice
        The subset of self.values to set
    value : object
        The value being set

    Returns
    -------
    Block

    Notes
    -----
    `indexer` is a direct slice/positional indexer. `value` must
    be a compatible shape.
    """
    transpose = self.ndim == 2

    # coerce None values, if appropriate
    if value is None:
        if self.is_numeric:
            value = np.nan

    # coerce if block dtype can store value
    values = self.values
    if self._can_hold_element(value):
        # We only get here for non-Extension Blocks, so _try_coerce_args
        #  is only relevant for DatetimeBlock and TimedeltaBlock
        if lib.is_scalar(value):
            value = convert_scalar(values, value)
    
    # cast the values to a type that can hold nan (if necessary)
    if not self._can_hold_element(value):
        dtype, _ = maybe_promote(np.array(value).dtype)
        values = values.astype(dtype)

    if transpose:
        values = values.T

    values[indexer] = value

    block = self.make_block(values)
    return block
