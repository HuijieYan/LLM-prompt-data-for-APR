The error message indicates that the inferred frequency from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency of CustomBusinessHour (CBH). This suggests that there is an issue in how the frequency is being handled within the `apply` method.

The potential error location is within the `apply` method where the frequency for CustomBusinessHour is being handled. The bug seems to be related to the frequency calculation and validation.

The bug is likely occurring because the frequency validation in the `apply` method is not handling the CustomBusinessHour frequency correctly. This is causing the ValueError to be raised when the frequency doesn't conform to the expected value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the frequency validation for CustomBusinessHour is accurately represented within the `apply` method.

Here's the corrected `apply` method:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import CustomBusinessHour
from pandas.tseries.offsets import DateOffset

def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # original code...

        if isinstance(self, CustomBusinessHour):
            if not isinstance(other, pd.DatetimeIndex):
                if other < self.onOffset(other):
                    return self.onOffset(other)
                else:
                    return self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                return pd.DatetimeIndex([self.onOffset(o) for o in other])

        # remaining original code...
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected `apply` method, we specifically handle the frequency validation for CustomBusinessHour. This should resolve the ValueError that was being raised in the original buggy code.
