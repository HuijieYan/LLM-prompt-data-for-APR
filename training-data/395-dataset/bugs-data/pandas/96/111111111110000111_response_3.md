The error occurs when using the `pd.date_range` function with a custom business hour frequency along with holidays. The test case `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` verifies this functionality and is failing with a ValueError.

The potential error location is within the `apply` method of the `BusinessHourMixin` class. The error occurs due to the incorrect handling of business hours when adding holidays, leading to an incorrect number of periods being generated.

The bug occurs because the `apply` method does not handle holidays correctly when determining the number of business hours. This results in an incorrect calculation of periods, leading to the `date_range` function producing more dates than expected.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when adding holidays, the method adjusts the calculation of business hours correctly to avoid an incorrect number of periods being generated.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` method:
```python
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... omitted code ...

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                if other in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))
                else:
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if other in self.holidays or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # ... remaining code ...

    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
In the corrected code, we handle holidays by checking if the `other` date is in the list of holidays and adjust the calculation of business hours accordingly. This ensures that the correct number of periods is generated when using `pd.date_range` with custom business hour frequency and holidays.
