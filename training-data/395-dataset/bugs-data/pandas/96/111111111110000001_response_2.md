The error message provided refers to a ValueError raised during the execution of the test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` at line 954. This error is related to frequency validation for a DatetimeArray/Index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `apply` function, specifically in the section where it is adjusting the business day and business hours.

The error likely occurred due to incorrect adjustments made to the `other` datetime object, which led to a mismatch with the expected frequency.

To fix the bug, the adjustments made to the `other` datetime object need to be reviewed and potentially re-implemented to ensure that the frequency remains valid.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # Reset timezone and nanosecond
        other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
        n = self.n

        # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() >= self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() < self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                other = other - timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, adjustments to the `other` datetime object have been simplified and corrected to ensure that the frequency remains valid.
