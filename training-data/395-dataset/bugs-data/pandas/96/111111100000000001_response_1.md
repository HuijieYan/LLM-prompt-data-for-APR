The potential error location within the problematic function is that it is trying to use the `datetime` class without importing it. This will raise a `NameError` when trying to use `datetime` in the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `datetime` class is being used without being imported.

To fix the bug, the `datetime` class needs to be imported. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Import the datetime class
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n

        # rest of the code...
        # (omitted for brevity)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
