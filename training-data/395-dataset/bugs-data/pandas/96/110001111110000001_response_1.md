The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the frequency being passed to the `pd.DatetimeIndex` constructor. The error message states "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH."

The potential error location within the function would be the way the frequency `freq` is being used within the `pd.DatetimeIndex` constructor.

The bug occurred because the frequency `freq` was not being handled correctly within the `apply` function. This caused the frequency to be inferred as None, leading to the error message.

To fix this bug, the `apply` function should handle the frequency `freq` properly to ensure it is correctly passed to the `pd.DatetimeIndex` constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... existing code ...

        # When creating the DatetimeIndex, use the `on` parameter to specify the frequency
        result = pd.DatetimeIndex(
            [other],
            freq=freq,  # Add the freq parameter to specify the frequency
            on=freq  # Use the freq as the frequency for the DatetimeIndex
        )

        return result
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
