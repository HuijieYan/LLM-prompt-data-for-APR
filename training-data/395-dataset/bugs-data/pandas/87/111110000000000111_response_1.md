The issue seems related to the way the column names are formed when a multi-index is used in the input Series objects `s1` and `s2`. The error is related to how the multi-index is processed and transformed into the column names when `pd.crosstab` is used.

The potential error location seems to be within the part of the code where the column names are assigned. Specifically, the issue might be with the line `data.update(zip(colnames, columns))` where the `columns` are being added to the data dictionary.

The bug occurs because the original implementation of the function is not handling the multi-index column names correctly when creating the pivot table. As a result, instead of using the multi-index directly as column names, dummy column names are being created.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the code that handles the assignment of column names and the creation of the pivot table to correctly use the multi-index as column names.

Here's the corrected implementation of the crosstab function:

```python
def crosstab(
    index,
    columns,
    values=None,
    rownames=None,
    colnames=None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins=False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    """
    Compute a simple cross tabulation of two (or more) factors. By default
    computes a frequency table of the factors unless an array of values and an
    aggregation function are passed.
    
    ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    """
    # (Existing code for the function)

    if values is None and aggfunc is not None:
        raise ValueError("aggfunc cannot be used without values.")

    if values is not None and aggfunc is None:
        raise ValueError("values cannot be used without an aggfunc.")

    from pandas import DataFrame

    if values is None:
        df = DataFrame(index, columns=columns)
        table = df.pivot_table(
            fill_value=0, margins=margins, margins_name=margins_name, dropna=dropna
        )
    else:
        df = DataFrame({columns.name: columns, index.name: index})
        kwargs = {"aggfunc": aggfunc}
        table = df.pivot_table(
            values=values,
            index=rownames,
            columns=colnames,
            aggfunc=aggfunc,
            fill_value=0,
            margins=margins,
            margins_name=margins_name,
            dropna=dropna,
            **kwargs,
        )

    # Post-process
    if normalize is not False:
        table = _normalize(
            table, normalize=normalize, margins=margins, margins_name=margins_name
        )

    return table
```

This corrected implementation should address the issue with multi-index column names and produce the expected output for the provided test case.
