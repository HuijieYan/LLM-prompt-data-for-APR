The test case `test_crosstab_both_tuple_names` is designed to create two `pd.Series` objects, `s1` and `s2`. Each of these Series objects has a MultiIndex as its `name` attribute. Additionally, the expected result is a DataFrame with MultiIndex for both rows and columns.

The error message is related to verifying the equality of the expected result and the actual result returned by the `crosstab` function. The issue seems to be with the creation of the columns of the resulting DataFrame, which are inferred to be different from the expected DataFrame.

Upon reviewing the `crosstab` function, the potential error location is in the construction of columns when calling `df.pivot_table` and in the subsequent post-processing section involving normalization.

The bug is likely occurring because the `columns` that are passed through `df.pivot_table` are not aligned with the expected MultiIndex that is specified for the columns in the test case. This can result in inconsistent naming and a mismatch in the resulting DataFrame.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the `columns` specified in the `df.pivot_table` call match the desired MultiIndex. Additionally, any post-processing steps that involve column normalization should also take into account the correctness of the column names and indices.

Here's the corrected version of the `crosstab` function:

```python
def crosstab(
    index,
    columns,
    values=None,
    rownames=None,
    colnames=None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins=False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # (existing code...)

    # ... (Previous code unchanged)

    table = df.pivot_table(
        "__dummy__",
        index=rownames,
        columns=colnames,  # Modified from "columns" to "colnames"
        margins=margins,
        margins_name=margins_name,
        dropna=dropna,
        **kwargs,
    )

    # Post-process
    if normalize is not False:
        table = _normalize(
            table, normalize=normalize, margins=margins, margins_name=margins_name
        )
        
    if colnames is not None:
        table.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(table.columns, names=colnames)  # Set the column names using MultiIndex

    return table
```

In the corrected code, the `df.pivot_table` call uses the `colnames` variable instead of `columns` for specifying the columns. Additionally, after the pivot table operation, the column names are adjusted using `pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples` based on the provided `colnames`. These modifications address the potential bug related to the mismatch between the expected MultiIndex and the resulting DataFrame.
