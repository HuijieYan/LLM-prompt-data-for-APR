The potential error location in the code is within the `crosstab` function. This function calculates a simple cross tabulation of two or more factors. This code currently looks like it is a mix of a method for a DataFrame and a method for numpy. 

The bug occurs when the code tries to create a DataFrame, especially when it tries to call `DataFrame.pivot_table`. This is because there are inconsistencies in the input parameters and some conditional statements that possibly run into errors.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to refactor the code in the `crosstab` function to eliminate references to non-existent methods and to handle input parameters properly. We need to ensure that the input data is being handled correctly and that the DataFrame object is created properly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Union, Dict


def crosstab(
    index: Union[List, np.ndarray],
    columns: Union[List, np.ndarray],
    values: Union[List, np.ndarray] = None,
    rownames: List[str] = None,
    colnames: List[str] = None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins: bool = False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize: bool = False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = np.array(index)
    columns = np.array(columns)

    if rownames is None:
        rownames = [f'row_{i}' for i in range(len(index))]
    if colnames is None:
        colnames = [f'col_{i}' for i in range(len(columns))]

    common_idx = list(set(index) & set(columns))

    data: Dict = {**dict(zip(rownames, index)), **dict(zip(colnames, columns))}

    if values is None and aggfunc is not None:
        raise ValueError("aggfunc cannot be used without values.")

    if values is not None and aggfunc is None:
        raise ValueError("values cannot be used without an aggfunc.")

    df = DataFrame(data, index=common_idx)
    if values is None:
        df["__dummy__"] = 0
        kwargs = {"aggfunc": len, "fill_value": 0}
    else:
        df["__dummy__"] = values
        kwargs = {"aggfunc": aggfunc}

    table = df.pivot_table(
        "__dummy__",
        index=rownames,
        columns=colnames,
        margins=margins,
        margins_name=margins_name,
        dropna=dropna,
        **kwargs,
    )

    # Post-process
    if normalize:
        table = (table - table.min()) / (table.max() - table.min())

    return table
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the function to accept different inputs for `index` and `columns`, and provided default names for them if not provided. We have also handled the creation of the DataFrame and pivot table more robustly, ensuring that the input parameters are used correctly. Additionally, we have included the normalizing operation as an optional step at the end of the function.
