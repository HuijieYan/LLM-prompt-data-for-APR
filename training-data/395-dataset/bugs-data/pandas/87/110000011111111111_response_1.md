The error occurs because the `crosstab` function returns a DataFrame with a MultiIndex, even though the expected output is to have regular integer columns. This discrepancy causes the assertion error in the test function.

The potential error location in the code is likely within the `df.pivot_table` method, where the columns are created in a way that results in a MultiIndex instead of regular integer columns.

The reason behind this bug is that the 'crosstab' function doesn't handle the case where the input Series have tuple names as expected.

To fix the bug, the 'crosstab' function needs to modify the code that creates the DataFrame with the new columns to ensure that it generates regular integer columns instead of a MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `crosstab` function:

```python
def crosstab(
    index,
    columns,
    values=None,
    rownames=None,
    colnames=None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins=False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize=False,
) -> "DataFrame":

    # existing code...

    # convert tuple names to strings if present
    if isinstance(index.name, tuple):
        rownames = [f"{name[0]}_{name[1]}" for name in [index.name]]
    else:
        rownames = [index.name]
    
    if isinstance(columns.name, tuple):
        colnames = [f"{name[0]}_{name[1]}" for name in [columns.name]]
    else:
        colnames = [columns.name]

    # existing code...

    return table
```

This modification ensures that even if the input Series have tuple names, the resulting DataFrame columns will be regular integer columns, as expected.
