The issue is related to the fact that when creating the DataFrame `df` inside the `crosstab` function, the `__dummy__` column is created with a MultiIndex, which is later causing the issue with the column names.

The reason behind the bug is that the `__dummy__` column is created with a MultiIndex because the index and columns are both tuples.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `__dummy__` is created without a MultiIndex. Additionally, we should modify the code to use the proper column names based on the provided input.

Here's the corrected code for the `crosstab` function:

```python
def crosstab(
    index,
    columns,
    values=None,
    rownames=None,
    colnames=None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins=False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (previous code)

    # Create the DataFrame without MultiIndex on the __dummy__ column
    df = DataFrame({("dummy", ""): [0] * len(index)}, index=index)
    
    if values is not None:
        df[("dummy", "")] = values

    if values is None:
        kwargs = {"aggfunc": len, "fill_value": 0}
    else:
        kwargs = {"aggfunc": aggfunc}

    table = df.pivot_table(
        ("dummy", ""),
        index=rownames,
        columns=colnames,
        margins=margins,
        margins_name=margins_name,
        dropna=dropna,
        **kwargs,
    )

    # ... (remaining code)

    return table
```

After making this change, the crosstab function should return the expected output for the given test case.
