The error message indicates that there is an issue with the MultiIndex columns returned by the crosstab function. The expected MultiIndex should be a RangeIndex, but it is a MultiIndex containing empty strings.

The potential error location is likely within the crosstab function, where the columns are being specified.

The bug occurs because the crosstab function is creating a MultiIndex with empty strings as column names instead of using a RangeIndex. This is likely due to the way the DataFrame is being constructed and does not properly handle MultiIndex.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the DataFrame construction and the setting of the columns result in a RangeIndex instead of a MultiIndex with empty strings.

```python
def crosstab(
    index,
    columns,
    values=None,
    rownames=None,
    colnames=None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins=False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (omitted code)

    df = DataFrame(data, index=common_idx)
    if values is None:
        df["__dummy__"] = 0
        kwargs = {"aggfunc": len, "fill_value": 0}
    else:
        df["__dummy__"] = values
        kwargs = {"aggfunc": aggfunc}

    table = df.pivot_table(
        "__dummy__",
        index=rownames,
        columns=colnames,
        margins=margins,
        margins_name=margins_name,
        dropna=dropna,
        **kwargs,
    )

    # ... (omitted code)
```

By ensuring that the columns are properly set in the DataFrame constructor, the bug can be fixed. Specifically, we should verify that the columns are correctly specified as a RangeIndex.

```python
df = DataFrame(data, index=common_idx)
df.columns = range(len(columns))
```

By setting the columns to a RangeIndex with the correct length, we ensure that the MultiIndex with empty strings as column names is replaced with a RangeIndex. This should fix the issue with the MultiIndex columns in the crosstab function.
