Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the creation of dummy columns with the multiIndex as columns when calling the crosstab function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because of the way the DataFrame is being created and manipulated within the crosstab function. The creation of dummy columns with the multiIndex as columns results in unexpected behavior when calling pd.crosstab with specific inputs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by modifying the way the DataFrame is manipulated within the crosstab function, specifically handling the creation and handling of dummy columns in a way that avoids the unexpected behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def crosstab(
    index,
    columns,
    values=None,
    rownames=None,
    colnames=None,
    aggfunc=None,
    margins=False,
    margins_name: str = "All",
    dropna: bool = True,
    normalize=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
