The issue seems to be that the `id_vars` and `value_vars` are not being handled properly when they contain numeric column names. The bug is likely occurring in the section of the `melt` function that checks for the presence of `id_vars` and `value_vars` in the DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the function tries to convert the numeric column names to strings when checking for their presence in the DataFrame, leading to a KeyError.

To fix this bug:
- We should handle numeric column names properly and not convert them to strings when checking for their presence in the DataFrame.
- Additionally, when handling the `id_vars` and `value_vars`, we need to consider both numeric and string column names, and we should make sure that their presence is properly checked and handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `melt` function:

```python
def melt(
    frame: DataFrame,
    id_vars=None,
    value_vars=None,
    var_name=None,
    value_name="value",
    col_level=None,
) -> DataFrame:
    if id_vars is not None:
        if not is_list_like(id_vars):
            id_vars = [id_vars]
        id_vars = list(id_vars)
        missing = [col for col in id_vars if col not in frame.columns]
        if any(missing):
            raise KeyError(
                f"The following 'id_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: {missing}"
            )
    else:
        id_vars = []

    if value_vars is not None:
        if not is_list_like(value_vars):
            value_vars = [value_vars]
        value_vars = list(value_vars)
        missing = [col for col in value_vars if col not in frame.columns]
        if any(missing):
            raise KeyError(
                f"The following 'value_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: {missing}"
            )
    else:
        value_vars = []

    # Remaining code can remain the same...

    # ... (remaining code)

```

In this corrected code:
- We have modified the checks for the presence of `id_vars` and `value_vars` in the DataFrame to handle both numeric and string column names properly.
- We use list comprehensions to find missing columns based on both numeric and string column names.
- We then raise a KeyError if any missing columns are found.

With these changes, the `melt` function should properly handle both numeric and string column names in `id_vars` and `value_vars`.
