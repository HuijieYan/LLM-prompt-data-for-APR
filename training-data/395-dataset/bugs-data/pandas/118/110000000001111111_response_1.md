The issue seems to stem from the fact that the `id_vars` are not recognized when they are numeric column names, such as `1`. This behavior might have changed in newer versions of pandas, leading to a KeyError in the `melt` function.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be modified to handle numeric column names correctly and not treat them as strings.

The potential error location is within the section that checks if `id_vars` are present in the DataFrame. The line `missing = Index(np.ravel(id_vars)).difference(cols)` is likely causing the issue by treating numeric column names as strings.

To fix the bug, the code can be modified to explicitly handle numeric column names. One possible approach is to convert the column names to strings before processing them further.

Here's the corrected code for the `melt` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_list_like
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import ABCMultiIndex
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.tile import Tile
from pandas.core.arrays.base import is_extension_array_dtype
from pandas.core.indexes.multi import get_indexer_non_unique
from pandas.core.dtypes.concat import concat

# this is the corrected function
def melt(
    frame: DataFrame,
    id_vars=None,
    value_vars=None,
    var_name=None,
    value_name="value",
    col_level=None,
) -> DataFrame:
    if id_vars is not None:
        if not is_list_like(id_vars):
            id_vars = [id_vars]
        elif isinstance(frame.columns, ABCMultiIndex) and not isinstance(id_vars, list):
            raise ValueError(
                "id_vars must be a list of tuples when columns are a MultiIndex"
            )
        else:
            id_vars = list(id_vars)
            # Convert numeric column names to strings
            id_vars = [str(col) for col in id_vars]
            missing = Index(np.ravel(id_vars)).difference(cols)
            if not missing.empty:
                raise KeyError(
                    "The following 'id_vars' are not present"
                    " in the DataFrame: {missing}"
                    "".format(missing=list(missing))
                )
    else:
        id_vars = []

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This modification explicitly converts the `id_vars` to strings so that numeric column names are handled correctly, preventing the KeyError that occurs when checking for their presence in the DataFrame.
