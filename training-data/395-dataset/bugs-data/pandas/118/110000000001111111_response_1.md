The issue seems to be related to the use of numeric column names in the `id_vars` parameter. When a numeric column name is used, it is being cast to a string, which causes the `keyError` because the string value is not found in the DataFrame.

The potential error location is within the conditional check for `id_vars` where the code uses `Index(np.ravel(id_vars)).difference(cols)`.

The issue occurs because when a numeric column name is passed as an `id_var`, it is implicitly cast to a string. This causes a mismatch when checking for the presence of the id_var in the DataFrame, resulting in a `KeyError`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle numeric column names explicitly when checking for the presence of id_vars in the DataFrame, and ensure that they are not implicitly cast to a string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def melt(
    frame: DataFrame,
    id_vars=None,
    value_vars=None,
    var_name=None,
    value_name="value",
    col_level=None,
) -> DataFrame:
    if id_vars is not None:
        id_vars = [str(col) if isinstance(col, numbers.Number) else col for col in id_vars]
        missing = [col for col in id_vars if col not in frame.columns]
        if missing:
            raise KeyError(f"The following 'id_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: {missing}")

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged
    ...

    return frame._constructor(mdata, columns=mcolumns)
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly convert numeric column names to strings before checking for their presence in the DataFrame. This ensures that there is no mismatch when checking for the presence of `id_vars`.
