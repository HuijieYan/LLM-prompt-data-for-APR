The error message indicates that the `melt` function is not able to handle integer type id_vars and value_vars. The problem is likely related to how the function is handling the id_vars and value_vars.

The issue seems to arise from the fact that the function is not handling integer type id_vars and value_vars correctly. The function is designed to check if the id_vars and value_vars are present in the DataFrame columns, but it seems to be encountering issues when dealing with integer id_vars and value_vars.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle integer type id_vars and value_vars properly. It should treat integer id_vars and value_vars as valid column names and should not raise an error if they are present in the DataFrame columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `melt` function:

```python
from pandas.core.reshape.melt import _melt
from pandas import DataFrame

def melt(
    frame: DataFrame,
    id_vars=None,
    value_vars=None,
    var_name=None,
    value_name="value",
    col_level=None,
) -> DataFrame:
    return _melt(
        frame=frame,
        id_vars=id_vars,
        value_vars=value_vars,
        var_name=var_name,
        value_name=value_name,
        col_level=col_level,
    )
```

In the corrected code, the melt function is simply calling the private function _melt, which should handle the integer id_vars and value_vars properly. This should resolve the issue with handling integer id_vars and value_vars.
