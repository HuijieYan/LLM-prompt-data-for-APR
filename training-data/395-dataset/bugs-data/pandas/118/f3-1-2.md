Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(columns=[1, "string"])
pd.melt(df, id_vars=[1, "string"])
Problem description
The shown example fails with

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 5, in <module>
    pd.melt(df, id_vars=[1, "string"])
  File "/home/nils/projects/tsfresh/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/reshape/melt.py", line 52, in melt
    "".format(missing=list(missing))
KeyError: "The following 'id_vars' are not present in the DataFrame: ['1']"
and I guess the reason is that the call of

Index(np.ravel(id_vars))
in pd.melt somehow casts the numerical column name 1 to the string "1".

I am not sure if this is intended behavior or if the case of numerical column names is just not supported, but at least in older pandas versions (e.g. 0.23.4) this still worked.

Thanks for looking into this! I am also fine if this is closed with "won't fix" :-)
