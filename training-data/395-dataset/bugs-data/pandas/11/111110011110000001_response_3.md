The error message provided shows a TypeError message that indicates an issue with casting a variable as an integer. This error occurred within the function `_coerce_indexer_frozen` which is called by the function `_make_concat_multiindex`.

The bug occurs because the function `_make_concat_multiindex` tries to use an array `arr` as an index, but it is failing due to a type error. This is likely because `arr` is being incorrectly treated as an integer. The approach to fixing this is to ensure that the array `arr` is being used correctly as an index.

The potential fix for the issue is to verify the way arrays are being handled and cast within the `_make_concat_multiindex` function. Additionally, checking if there are any instances where arrays are incorrectly treated as integers would be helpful.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # Existing code...

    # Verify how arrays are being used as indexes and ensure they are cast appropriately
    for index in indexes:
        if not isinstance(index, (list, np.ndarray)):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid index type: {type(index)}")

    concat_index = _concat_indexes(indexes)

    # Corrected code...
```
