The potential error in the code is likely related to the way the `MultiIndex` is being created. The code is trying to concatenate the indexes, but it's not doing it in a way that ensures the resulting `MultiIndex` is constructed properly.

The bug is occurring because the function is not handling all the cases correctly when creating a `MultiIndex`. It is assuming that the indexes have the same number of levels and that they can be concatenated without considering the levels and codes properly.

To fix this bug, the function should check the levels and codes of the indexes, ensure they are compatible for concatenation, and then create a new `MultiIndex` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    if len({idx.nlevels for idx in indexes}) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Cannot concat indices that do not have the same number of levels")

    if levels is None:
        levels = [None] * len(keys)
    if names is None:
        names = [None] * len(keys)

    codes_list = []
    for key, level in zip(keys, levels):
        if level is None:
            codes, categories = factorize(key)
        else:
            codes, _ = factorize_from_iterable(item for item, _ in zip(key, level))
            categories = level
        codes_list.append(codes)
        levels.append(categories)

    codes_list.extend([index.labels for index in indexes])
    levels.extend([index.levels for index in indexes])

    names.extend(get_consensus_names(indexes))

    return MultiIndex(levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
```

This corrected code properly handles the creation of `MultiIndex` by checking and ensuring the compatibility of levels and codes from the input indexes before concatenating them.
