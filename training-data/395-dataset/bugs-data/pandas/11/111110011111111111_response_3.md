The error is occurring when there is an attempt to concatenate a DataFrame with Series using duplicate keys. This is resulting in a TypeError because the function `_make_concat_multiindex` is not handling the duplicate keys correctly.

The issue seems to be with the generation of `codes_list`. The bug occurs due to incorrect slicing and concatenation with the `to_concat` list. This is leading to the `TypeError` when trying to coerce the dtype to `int8`.

To fix the bug, the function `_make_concat_multiindex` needs to be modified to correctly handle the duplicate keys and create the `codes_list` appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:

    if (levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple)) or (
        levels is not None and len(levels) > 1
    ):
        zipped = list(zip(*keys))
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(zipped)

        if levels is None:
            _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]
    else:
        zipped = [keys]
        if names is None:
            names = [None]

        if levels is None:
            levels = [ensure_index(keys)]
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    if not all_indexes_same(indexes):
        codes_list = []

        for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
            to_concat = []
            for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
                try:
                    i = level.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError as err:
                    raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err

                to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
            codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat))

        if len(levels) == 1:
            level = MultiIndex.from_tuples([(k,) for k in keys])
            levels = [level]
        
        for indices in zip(*indexes):
            for i, idx in enumerate(indices):
                if i == 0:
                    code = codes_list[i]
                else:
                    code = code + len(levels[i-1]) * idx
            codes_list.append(code)

        return MultiIndex(
            levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False
        )
```

This change will properly handle the generation of codes for the multi-index based on the input keys and indexes, fixing the TypeError and allowing for concatenation of DataFrame with Series with duplicate keys.
