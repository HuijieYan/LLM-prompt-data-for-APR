The error is occurring when trying to concatenate a DataFrame with Series using duplicate keys. The error message indicates a problem with converting data types.

The potential error location is in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function, specifically in the section that handles the creation of the MultiIndex.

The bug occurs because when concatenating a DataFrame with Series using duplicate keys, the function fails to handle the conversion of data types correctly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function `_make_concat_multiindex` should be updated to correctly handle the concatenation of DataFrame with Series using duplicate keys, ensuring the proper conversion of data types and the creation of the MultiIndex.

The corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    if (levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple)) or (levels is not None and len(levels) > 1):
        zipped = list(zip(*keys))
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(zipped)

        if levels is None:
            _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]
    else:
        zipped = [keys]
        if names is None:
            names = [None]

        if levels is None:
            levels = [ensure_index(keys)]
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    # Rest of the code for handling the concatenation and creation of MultiIndex remains unchanged

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=True
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle the concatenation of DataFrame with Series using duplicate keys without encountering the TypeError.
