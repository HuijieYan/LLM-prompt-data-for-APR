The error message indicates that there is an issue with the lengths of the arrays being concatenated. Specifically, the `MultiIndex` object that is being created in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function seems to have a problem with the lengths of the different arrays that it is trying to combine. This is likely causing the subsequent error messages and failures in the test case.

The problem occurs because the `MultiIndex` object is being constructed using incorrect lengths of arrays. This could be due to issues with the input data or a bug in the implementation of the `_make_concat_multiindex` function.

One approach to fix the bug in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function is to ensure that the lengths of the arrays being combined are compatible. Additionally, the code should handle the case where the lengths of the arrays may vary and perform the necessary operations to address that.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    codes_list = []
    levels = None
    names = None

    for index in indexes:
        codes = np.arange(len(index))
        codes_list.append(codes)

    if names is None:
        names = [None] * len(indexes)

    return MultiIndex(levels=[indexes], codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
```
