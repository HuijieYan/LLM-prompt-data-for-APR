The bug is likely happening in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function of the `pandas` library when a MultiIndex is being constructed from a list of keys. The error messages suggest that there are issues with the generated keys and their lengths that are causing a TypeError and also an AssertionError.

Looking at the possible error location, the issue could be in the code that constructs the `codes_list` which is used to determine the levels and codes for the MultiIndex. In the buggy function, several slicing operations are being performed on the `codes_list`, and it seems that these slices are not being handled correctly, leading to a TypeError when the indexers are coerced to int8.

The reason behind this bug seems to be the incorrect handling of slicing operations in creating the `codes_list`, which should contain the codes for the corresponding index levels.

To fix this bug, the slicing operation should be handled correctly to convert them into valid codes that can be used to create a MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # ... (previous code)

    # Construct codes
    new_codes = []

    for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
        hlevel = ensure_index(hlevel)
        mapped = level.get_indexer(hlevel)

        mask = mapped == -1
        if mask.any():
            raise ValueError(f"Values not found in passed level: {hlevel[mask]!s}")

        new_codes.append(mapped)  # Append the mapped values directly

    # Modification to handle MultiIndex properly
    if isinstance(new_index, MultiIndex):
        new_levels.extend(new_index.levels)
        new_codes.extend(new_index.codes)
    else:
        new_levels.append(new_index)
        new_codes.append(np.arange(new_index.nlevels))

    if len(new_names) < len(new_levels):
        new_names.extend(new_index.names)

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels,
        codes=new_codes, 
        names=new_names, 
        verify_integrity=False
    )
```

This fix focuses on directly appending the mapped values to `new_codes` and also handling the case where the `new_index` is a MultiIndex. These changes ensure that the correct values are used for creating the MultiIndex.

This corrected method should resolve the TypeError and AssertionError encountered in the test cases.
