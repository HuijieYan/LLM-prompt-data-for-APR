The error message "TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'slice'" and the expected output suggest that the bug is related to concatenating a DataFrame with Series using the `concat` function. 

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function, specifically in the code section where it deals with concatenating the indices.

The bug occurs because the function fails to properly handle the concatenation of a DataFrame with a Series. This leads to an erroneous TypeError being raised when the user attempts to concatenate these objects.

To fix the bug, the `_make_concat_multiindex` function should be modified to handle the concatenation of a DataFrame with a Series properly. This may involve adjusting the logic for concatenating the indices and ensuring that the function can handle the particular case of concatenating a DataFrame with a Series.

Here is the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Corrected logic for concatenating indices

    concat_index = _concat_indexes(indexes)
    
    # Ensure that the concatenation result is a MultiIndex
    if not isinstance(concat_index, MultiIndex):
        concat_index = MultiIndex.from_arrays(tuple(indexes))

    return concat_index
```

This corrected function ensures that the result of concatenating the indices is always a MultiIndex, which addresses the bug related to concatenating a DataFrame with a Series.
