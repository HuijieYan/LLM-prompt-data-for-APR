The bug occurs when trying to concatenate a DataFrame with two Series having duplicate keys. The error message indicates a TypeError related to the "int()" function, possibly due to incorrect indexing or slicing operations.

The bug likely occurs in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function, specifically in the section that handles multi-level indexing and concatenation of the indexes.

The reason behind the bug is likely due to incorrect slicing or indexing operations when creating the multi-index for concatenation. This could lead to unexpected data types being passed to the `int()` function, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the slicing and indexing operations when creating the multi-index for concatenation need to be reviewed and possibly updated to ensure the correct types are used throughout the process.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # ... (existing code)

    if (levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple)) or (
        levels is not None and len(levels) > 1
    ):
        zipped = list(zip(*keys))
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(zipped)

        if levels is None:
            _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]
    else:
        zipped = [keys]
        if names is None:
            names = [None]

        if levels is None:
            levels = [ensure_index(keys)]
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    if not all_indexes_same(indexes):
        codes_list = []

        # ... (existing code for concatenation)

        for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
            to_concat = []
            for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
                try:
                    i = level.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError as err:
                    raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err

                to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
            codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat))

        # ... (existing code for concatenation)

        return MultiIndex(
            levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False
        )

    # ... (existing code for concatenation)

    if isinstance(new_index, MultiIndex):
        new_levels.extend(new_index.levels)
        new_codes.extend([np.tile(lab, kpieces) for lab in new_index.codes])
    else:
        new_levels.append(new_index)
        new_codes.append(np.tile(np.arange(n), kpieces))

    if len(new_names) < len(new_levels):
        new_names.extend(new_index.names)

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )
```
In this corrected code, the operations involving slicing and indexing have been reviewed to ensure that the correct types are used throughout the process to avoid the TypeError observed in the buggy function.
