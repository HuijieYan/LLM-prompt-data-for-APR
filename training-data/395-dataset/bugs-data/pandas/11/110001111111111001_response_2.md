The bug in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function seems to be related to the handling of the `code_list` variable, specifically when there are slices present in the data.

The error message from the test function states that a TypeError is raised due to an attempt to convert a slice into an integer. This suggests that the `code_list` is incorrectly formatted or contains non-integer elements, resulting in the failure of the concatenation process.

Upon reviewing the function and the expected variable values, it seems that the bug arises from the way slices are being handled within the `to_concat` list. This inconsistent handling leads to incorrect data types within the `code_list`, causing the concatenation to fail.

To fix the bug, the handling of slices within the `to_concat` list should be revised to ensure that the resulting `code_list` contains only integer elements. Additionally, the concatenation of indices should be reviewed to correct any data type inconsistencies.

Below is the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # ... previous code ...

    if not all_indexes_same(indexes):
        # ... previous code ...
        
        for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
            to_concat = []
            for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
                try:
                    i = level.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError as err:
                    raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err

                to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
            if any(isinstance(x, slice) for x in to_concat):
                to_concat = [np.arange(len(index)) if isinstance(x, slice) else x for x in to_concat] # Handling slices
            codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat))

        # ... subsequent code ...
        
    return MultiIndex(
        levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False
    )
```

This corrected function should resolve the bug by properly handling slices and ensuring that the `code_list` only contains integer elements, preventing the TypeError encountered in the previous version.
