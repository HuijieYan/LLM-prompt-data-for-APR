Issue:
The bug originates from the comparison of levels and the creation of codes_list within the if-else statement. There is a mismatch in lengths while using `slice` objects within the `codes_list` in the buggy function.

Reason:
The bug arises because the function tries to compare the levels and construct `codes_list` by using slices, leading to mismatched sizes and incorrect concatenation.

Approach:
To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the section of the code where `codes_list` is created within the if-else statement. The use of `slice` objects in creating `codes_list` should be replaced with a consistent approach to ensure there aren't any mismatched sizes.

```python
from pandas import MultiIndex
import numpy as np

def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # existing code
    if (levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple)) or (levels is not None and len(levels) > 1):
        # existing code

        if not all_indexes_same(indexes):
            codes_list = []

            for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
                to_concat = []
                for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
                    try:
                        i = level.get_loc(key)
                    except KeyError as err:
                        raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err
                    
                    to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
                codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat))

            # existing code 

            return MultiIndex(
                levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False
            )

    # existing code
``` 

The correction involves replacing the existing code for constructing `codes_list` within the if-else statement. This modification ensures that there are no mismatched sizes while creating `codes_list` and solves the buggy behavior.
