The bug seems to be occurring in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function. The `TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'slice'` error suggests that there may be an issue with concatenating the indexes. Looking at the code, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of duplicate keys and the slicing of indexes.

The bug occurs when there are duplicate keys in the `s1` and `s2` Series, which causes the slicing process to fail within the `_make_concat_multiindex` function. The slicing process expects specific data types (string, bytes-like object, or number), but when encountering a slice, it raises the `TypeError`.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the slicing process correctly handles slices and does not encounter the `TypeError` by converting the slices to an appropriate format. Additionally, handling duplicate keys in a way that prevents slicing from encountering unexpected data types may also be necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:

    if (levels is None and isinstance(keys[0], tuple)) or (
        levels is not None and len(levels) > 1
    ):
        zipped = list(zip(*keys))
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(zipped)

        if levels is None:
            _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]
    else:
        zipped = [keys]
        if names is None:
            names = [None]

        if levels is None:
            levels = [ensure_index(keys)]
        else:
            levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    if not all_indexes_same(indexes):
        codes_list = []

        # things are potentially different sizes, so compute the exact codes
        # for each level and pass those to MultiIndex.from_arrays

        for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
            to_concat = []
            for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
                try:
                    i = level.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError as err:
                    raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err

                to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
            codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat).astype('int'))

        concat_index = _concat_indexes(indexes)

        # these go at the end
        if isinstance(concat_index, MultiIndex):
            levels.extend(concat_index.levels)
            codes_list.extend(concat_index.codes)
        else:
            codes, categories = factorize_from_iterable(concat_index)
            levels.append(categories)
            codes_list.append(codes)

        if len(names) == len(levels):
            names = list(names)
        else:
            # make sure that all of the passed indices have the same nlevels
            if not len({idx.nlevels for idx in indexes}) == 1:
                raise AssertionError(
                    "Cannot concat indices that do not have the same number of levels"
                )

            # also copies
            names = names + get_consensus_names(indexes)

        return MultiIndex(
            levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False,
        )

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, I've added `.astype('int')` to ensure that slices are converted to integers, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
