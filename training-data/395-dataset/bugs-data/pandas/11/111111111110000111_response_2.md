The error indicates that there is an issue with concatenating a DataFrame with Series using duplicate keys. The specific error "TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'slice'" suggests that there is an attempt to convert a slice into an integer, which is not allowed in Python.

The bug is likely occurring in the `_make_concat_multiindex` function, where the keys are being manipulated for concatenation. There is a problem with the handling of keys and their conversion into integer values.

To fix this bug, the handling of keys and their conversion into integer values needs to be revisited. The bug could be due to improper handling of keys or incorrect type conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_concat_multiindex` function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    key_tuples = [(k,) if not isinstance(k, tuple) else k for k in keys]
    
    zipped = list(zip(*key_tuples))
    
    if names is None:
        names = [None] * len(zipped)

    if levels is None:
        _, levels = factorize_from_iterables(zipped)
    else:
        levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    codes_list = []
    for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
        to_concat = []
        for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
            try:
                i = level.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError as err:
                raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err

            to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
        codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat))

    names = list(names) + get_consensus_names(indexes)

    return MultiIndex(
        levels=levels, codes=codes_list, names=names, verify_integrity=False
    )
```

In the corrected code, the keys are converted into tuples if they are not already tuples. The zipped keys are then processed with levels to generate the codes for a new MultiIndex. Additionally, the names are properly handled to get the consensus names.

This corrected function should address the bug related to concatenating DataFrames with Series using duplicate keys and prevent the "TypeError" that was occurring.
