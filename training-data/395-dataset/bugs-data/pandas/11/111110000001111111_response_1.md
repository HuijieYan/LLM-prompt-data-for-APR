The bug seems to be occurring in the section of the code where the function is trying to handle the concatenation of keys and levels. It is likely that the bug is caused by incorrect handling of the keys and levels in the zipped list, leading to the TypeError encountered in the test case.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling duplicate keys correctly. When the function encounters duplicate keys, it tries to concatenate them without ensuring that the keys are unique. This leads to the TypeError encountered in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should first check for duplicate keys and handle them appropriately. One possible approach is to modify the zipped list to ensure that unique keys are used for concatenating the levels.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None):
    unique_keys = list(set(keys))
    
    if levels is None:
        levels = [ensure_index(unique_keys)]
    else:
        levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    if not all_indexes_same(indexes):
        # handle duplicate keys
        zipped = list(zip(*unique_keys))
        if names is None:
            names = [None] * len(zipped)

        codes_list = []
        for hlevel, level in zip(zipped, levels):
            to_concat = []
            for key, index in zip(hlevel, indexes):
                try:
                    i = level.get_loc(key)
                except KeyError as err:
                    raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err

                to_concat.append(np.repeat(i, len(index)))
            codes_list.append(np.concatenate(to_concat))

        # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that unique keys are used for the concatenation of levels. This should resolve the issue with concatenating DataFrame with Series with duplicate keys.
