Without a test case, it's difficult to definitively identify the bug in the provided function. However, there are a few potential areas where issues could arise:

1. The function checks if the levels parameter is None and if the first element of keys is a tuple. This check seems redundant and could potentially lead to incorrect behavior.

2. The function tries to concatenate indexes, but there may be issues with the logic for determining the structure and values of the concatenated index.

3. The construction of new_levels and new_codes may also have issues related to handling MultiIndex objects and single indexes differently.

To correct these issues, the code could be refactored to remove redundant checks and ensure consistent logic for handling both MultiIndex and single Index objects.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_concat_multiindex(indexes, keys, levels=None, names=None) -> MultiIndex:
    # Initialize names if None
    if names is None:
        names = [None] * len(keys)
    
    # Convert keys to a list of tuples if necessary
    if not isinstance(keys[0], tuple):
        keys = [(key,) for key in keys]
    
    # Ensure levels are properly processed
    if levels is None:
        levels = [idx for idx in zip(*keys)]
    else:
        levels = [ensure_index(x) for x in levels]

    codes = []
    for level, idx in zip(levels, indexes):
        level_codes = []
        for key in level:
            try:
                i = level.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError as err:
                raise ValueError(f"Key {key} not in level {level}") from err
            level_codes.append(np.repeat(i, len(idx)))
        codes.append(np.concatenate(level_codes))

    # Concatenate the indexes and update levels and codes
    concat_index = _concat_indexes(indexes)
    if isinstance(concat_index, MultiIndex):
        levels.extend(concat_index.levels)
        codes.extend(concat_index.codes)
    else:
        new_codes, categories = factorize_from_iterable(concat_index)
        levels.append(categories)
        codes.append(new_codes)

    # Ensure consistency of names
    if len(names) < len(levels):
        names.extend([None] * (len(levels) - len(names)))

    return MultiIndex(levels=levels, codes=codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False)
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic and handles both MultiIndex and single Index objects more consistently.
