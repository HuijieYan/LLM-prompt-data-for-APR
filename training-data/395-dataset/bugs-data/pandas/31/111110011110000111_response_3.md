The bug is occurring in the `quantile` method of the `GroupBy` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` with no matching signature found. This issue is associated with the incorrect dtype handling for nullable integer and boolean arrays.

The reason behind the bug is that the `quantile` method does not handle nullable integer and boolean array types properly, resulting in a `TypeError` due to the lack of a matching signature for these data types.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `quantile` method to handle nullable integer and boolean array types correctly, ensuring that the method can work with these data types and avoiding the `TypeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    if is_scalar(q):
        return self._get_cythonized_result(
            "group_quantile",
            aggregate=True,
            needs_values=True,
            needs_mask=True,
            cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
            pre_processing=self.pre_processor,
            post_processing=self.post_processor,
            q=q,
            interpolation=interpolation,
        )
    else:
        results = [
            self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=self.pre_processor,
                post_processing=self.post_processor,
                q=qi,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
            for qi in q
        ]
        result = pd.concat(results, axis=0, keys=q)
        # Reorder levels to place quantiles on the inside
        result = result.unstack()
        return result
```

In this corrected method, we use the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions defined within the class to handle nullable integer and boolean data types correctly. Additionally, we have updated the concatenation and reshaping logic to produce the desired output.

By applying these corrections, the `quantile` method should now work properly for nullable integer and boolean array types.
