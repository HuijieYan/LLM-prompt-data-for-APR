The potential error location within the problematic function is the error handling. The function is supposed to raise a TypeError if 'quantile' is performed against 'object' dtypes, but the current code does not handle this scenario correctly.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to perform 'quantile' against 'object' dtypes without properly handling this scenario, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix this bug, we should add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that 'quantile' is not performed on 'object' dtypes. If the dtype is 'object', then raise a TypeError with an appropriate error message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    """
    Return group values at the given quantile, a la numpy.percentile.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value(s) between 0 and 1 providing the quantile(s) to compute.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        Method to use when the desired quantile falls between two points.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
        Return type determined by caller of GroupBy object.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame([
    ...     ['a', 1], ['a', 2], ['a', 3],
    ...     ['b', 1], ['b', 3], ['b', 5]
    ... ], columns=['key', 'val'])
    >>> df.groupby('key').quantile()
        val
    key
    a    2.0
    b    3.0
    """
    from pandas import concat

    if is_object_dtype(self):
        raise TypeError(
            "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!"
        )

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
In the corrected code, we have added an if condition to check if the groupby object has an 'object' dtype. If so, it raises a TypeError with an appropriate error message.
