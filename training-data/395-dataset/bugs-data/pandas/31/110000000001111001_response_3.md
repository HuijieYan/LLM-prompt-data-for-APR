The potential error location is within the `pre_processor` function, specifically in the handling of datetime64 dtype. When the `is_datetime64_dtype` condition is met, the function converts the values of that dtype to float. However, it does not account for the case where the values are already in float dtype. This can lead to errors in downstream processing, particularly when checking for the `is_integer_dtype` and the `interpolation` types.

To fix this bug, the `pre_processor` function should be modified to handle the case where the input values are already in float dtype. Additionally, the post-processing tasks should be revisited to ensure the proper handling of values and inference types.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    def pre_processor(vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        if is_object_dtype(vals):
            raise TypeError(
                "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!"
            )

        inference = None
        if is_integer_dtype(vals):
            inference = np.int64
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(vals):
            inference = "datetime64[ns]"
            if vals.dtype != np.float64:  # Check if the values are not already in float dtype
                vals = np.asarray(vals).astype(np.float)

        return vals, inference

    def post_processor(vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        if inference:
            if is_integer_dtype(inference) and interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}:
                if vals.dtype != inference:  # Check if the dtype is different from the inferred type
                    vals = vals.astype(inference)

        return vals

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

With these modifications, the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions will handle input values more robustly, taking into account cases where the values are already in float dtype and ensuring the proper type conversions during post-processing.
