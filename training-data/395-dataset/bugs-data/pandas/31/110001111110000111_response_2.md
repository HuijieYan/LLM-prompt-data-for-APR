The error occurs when calling the `quantile` method on a GroupBy object with nullable integer or boolean data. The error message suggests that there is no matching signature found, which can indicate an issue with the function signature or data types.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_cythonized_result` method, which is called by the `quantile` method. The error occurs when trying to call this method with the given arguments.

The bug occurs because the `_get_cythonized_result` method does not handle nullable integer or boolean data types correctly. The method expects specific data types that may not be compatible with nullable integer or boolean data.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_cythonized_result` method to handle nullable integer and boolean data types correctly. This may involve updating the function signature and handling the specific data type cases within the method.

Here is the corrected code for the `quantile` method within the `GroupBy` class:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    # ... [omitted code] ...
    
    def post_processor(vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        if inference:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(inference):
                vals = pd.array(np.round(vals), dtype=inference)
    
        return vals
    
    pre_proc = None
    if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(self._selected_obj):
        pre_proc = pre_processor_integer
    elif pd.api.types.is_boolean_dtype(self._selected_obj):
        pre_proc = pre_processor_boolean

    return self._get_cythonized_result(
        "group_quantile",
        aggregate=True,
        needs_values=True,
        needs_mask=True,
        cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
        pre_processing=pre_proc,
        post_processing=post_processor,
        q=q,
        interpolation=interpolation,
    )
```

In this corrected code, we have added checks for nullable integer and boolean data types and included appropriate preprocessing and post-processing functions.

The corrected code ensures that the `quantile` method can handle nullable integer and boolean data types correctly when calling the `_get_cythonized_result` method.
