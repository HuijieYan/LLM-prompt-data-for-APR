The error is occurring in the `quantile` method of the `GroupBy` class. The error message suggests that there is no matching signature found, and the error is related to the `group_quantile` method.

The bug is likely caused by a missing or incorrect signature for the `group_quantile` method that is being called within the `quantile` method. This error is leading to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug:
1. The signature of the `group_quantile` method should be checked to ensure that it matches the arguments being passed to it. It seems that the method is not being called with the correct arguments, leading to the "No matching signature found" error. 
2. The method `group_quantile` should be updated to handle the cases where the arguments `q` and `interpolation` are passed to it.

Corrected function for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    # Other code remains the same

    if is_scalar(q):
        return self._get_cythonized_result(
            "group_quantile",
            aggregate=True,
            needs_values=True,
            needs_mask=True,
            cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
            pre_processing=self.pre_processor,
            post_processing=self.post_processor,
            q=q,
            interpolation=interpolation,
        )
    else:
        results = [
            self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=self.pre_processor,
                post_processing=self.post_processor,
                q=qi,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
            for qi in q
        ]
        result = concat(results, axis=0, keys=q)
        # Fix levels to place quantiles on the inside
        # The code to fix levels and reorder index can remain the same

        return result.take(indices)
```

Regarding the test case, it is important to ensure that the test case covers scenarios where this method would be called with different arguments and datatypes to check for correctness.

After making these changes, the `quantile` method should be able to handle nullable integers and perform the necessary quantile calculations without raising a `TypeError`.
