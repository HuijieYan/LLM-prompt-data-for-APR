Error location: The issue is likely to be in the `pre_processor` function as it checks if the values are of object dtype and raises a TypeError if they are.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `pre_processor` function is expecting `vals` to be of type `np.ndarray`, but it is not being imported from the numpy module. Additionally, the `is_object_dtype` function is not defined in the code, so it will cause a NameError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the necessary functions from the numpy module and define the `is_object_dtype` function. Additionally, use the correct condition to check if the values are of object dtype and raise an appropriate error.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
import numpy as np
from pandas import DataFrame, concat
from pandas.api.types import is_object_dtype, is_integer_dtype, is_datetime64_dtype
from typing import Tuple, Optional, Type

def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    def pre_processor(vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        if any(isinstance(val, str) for val in vals):
            raise TypeError(
                "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!"
            )

        inference = None
        if any(isinstance(val, int) for val in vals):
            inference = np.int64
        elif any(isinstance(val, np.datetime64) for val in vals):
            inference = "datetime64[ns]"
            vals = np.asarray(vals).astype(np.float)

        return vals, inference

    def post_processor(vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        if inference:
            # Check for edge case
            if not (
                is_integer_dtype(inference)
                and interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}
            ):
                vals = vals.astype(inference)

        return vals

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...

```

In the corrected code, we have used `isinstance` to check if any of the values are of a specific type, and then raised a TypeError accordingly. We have also imported numpy functions and corrected the dtype checks.
