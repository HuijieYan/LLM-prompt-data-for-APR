The bug is likely located in the `quantile` method of the `GroupBy` class. The error message indicates that no matching signature was found, which suggests that there may be an issue with the method's parameters or input handling.

Upon analyzing the test case, it seems that the error occurs when trying to compute the quantile for a column with nullable integers (`pd.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype="Int64")`). This suggests that the bug may be related to handling nullable integer types.

The `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions within the `quantile` method are likely not handling nullable integers correctly, leading to the error when computing the quantile.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `pre_processor` and `post_processor` functions to properly handle nullable integer types. This may involve checking for nullable integer types and converting them to a suitable format for quantile calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    # ... (other code)

    def pre_processor(vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        if is_object_dtype(vals):
            raise TypeError(
                "'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!"
            )

        inference = None
        if is_integer_dtype(vals) or is_integer_dtype(vals) or is_signed_integer_dtype(vals):
            inference = np.float64
            vals = np.asarray(pd.array(vals)).astype(float)

        return vals, inference

    def post_processor(vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        if is_float_dtype(inference):
            # Check for edge case
            if not (
                is_integer_dtype(vals)
                and interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}
            ):
                vals = vals.astype(inference)

        return vals

    # ... (other code)
```

In this corrected code, the `pre_processor` function now checks for nullable integer types and converts them to `float` for quantile calculation. The `post_processor` function also accounts for nullable integer types in the conversion process.

With these modifications, the `quantile` method should now be able to handle nullable integer types correctly when computing quantiles.
