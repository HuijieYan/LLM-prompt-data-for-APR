The bug in the `quantile` method of the `SeriesGroupBy` object is due to the use of nullable data types (e.g., nullable integers and nullable booleans) in the input data. The `quantile` method fails to handle nullable data types correctly, leading to a "No matching signature found" TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle nullable data types correctly, especially when computing quantiles based on nullable integers and booleans.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    from pandas.api.types import is_integer_dtype, is_boolean_dtype

    def pre_processor(vals):
        if is_boolean_dtype(vals):
            vals = vals.astype(float)

        return vals

    return self._get_cythonized_result(
        "group_quantile",
        aggregate=True,
        needs_values=True,
        needs_mask=True,
        cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
        pre_processing=pre_processor,
        q=q,
        interpolation=interpolation,
    )
```

In the corrected code, a pre-processor function is used to handle nullable data types. If the data type is a nullable boolean, it is converted to a nullable float before computing the quantile. This change ensures that the quantile computation can handle nullable data types correctly.

With this fix, the `quantile` method should be able to handle nullable integers and booleans correctly, resolving the "No matching signature found" TypeError.
