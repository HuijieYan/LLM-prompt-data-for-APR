The issue occurred due to the problem with assigning the variable `ax` when the `axis` parameter is passed as a string instead of an integer. In the provided code for the `interpolate` method, when `axis` is not equal to 0 or 1, `ax` is not being assigned a value, which leads to the UnboundLocalError when used later in the code.

To fix the issue, the `interpolate` method needs to be modified so that when `axis` is a string, `ax` is assigned the appropriate value according to the condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate` method:
```python
@Appender(_shared_docs["interpolate"] % _shared_doc_kwargs)
def interpolate(
    self,
    method="linear",
    axis=0,
    limit=None,
    inplace=False,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    downcast=None,
    **kwargs
):
    """
    Interpolate values according to different methods.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    if axis == 0:
        ax = self._info_axis_name
        _maybe_transposed_self = self
    elif axis == 1:
        _maybe_transposed_self = self.T
        ax = 1
    else:
        if axis == 'index':
            ax = 0
            _maybe_transposed_self = self
        elif axis == 'columns':
            ax = 1
            _maybe_transposed_self = self.T
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid value for axis parameter")
    ax = _maybe_transposed_self._get_axis_number(ax)

    # rest of the method code
```

In the corrected code, when `axis` is a string, we are explicitly assigning the correct values to `ax` according to the given axis name.

With this modification, the `interpolate` method should work without raising the UnboundLocalError when `axis` is passed as a string.
