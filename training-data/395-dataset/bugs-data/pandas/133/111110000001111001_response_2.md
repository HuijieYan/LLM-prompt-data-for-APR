The buggy function is the `interpolate` method inside the class `NDFrame`. The function is not handling the `axis` parameter correctly and is resulting in incorrect behavior. The function checks for `axis` being 0 or 1, but when `axis` is not 0 or 1, it does not handle this case properly.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case when `axis` is not 0 or 1 by raising an error or taking alternative action to handle the given axis.


```python
def interpolate(self, method="linear", axis=0, limit=None, inplace=False, limit_direction="forward", limit_area=None, downcast=None, **kwargs):
        """
        Interpolate values according to different methods.
        """
        inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
        
        if axis == 0:
            ax = self._info_axis_name
            _maybe_transposed_self = self
        elif axis == 1:
            _maybe_transposed_self = self.T
            ax = 1
        else:
            raise ValueError("Axis must be 0 or 1")
        
        ax = _maybe_transposed_self._get_axis_number(ax)
        
        if _maybe_transposed_self.ndim == 2:
            alt_ax = 1 - ax
        else:
            alt_ax = ax
            
        # remaining code...
```

This correction ensures that the `interpolate` method will handle the case when the `axis` is not 0 or 1 by raising a ValueError.
