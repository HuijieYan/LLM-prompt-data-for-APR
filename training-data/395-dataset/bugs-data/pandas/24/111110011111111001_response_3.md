The test case `test_tz_localize_invalidates_freq` sets up a `DatetimeIndex` `dti` with a frequency of 1 hour and then tries to localize it to the US/Eastern timezone with `nonexistent` set to "shift_forward". The assertion failure indicates that the frequency is not being preserved as expected.

The potential error location within the `tz_localize` function could be in the part where it handles the timezone localization. It seems that the code is not correctly handling the preservation of frequency during the localization process.

The incorrect preservation of the frequency might be happening due to the logic within the `tz_localize` function that handles the adjustment of timezone and localization. It appears that the adjustments made to timezone might be affecting the frequency preservation.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to carefully review the logic responsible for handling the frequency preservation during the timezone localization. This might involve updating the logic to ensure that the frequency attribute is correctly preserved after localization.

Below is the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
        self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
    )
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    if self.freq is not None:
        # Preserve the original frequency
        return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=tz_to_dtype(tz), freq=self.freq)
    else:
        return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=tz_to_dtype(tz))
```

In the corrected code, after performing the timezone localization, it checks if the original `freq` attribute is not None and if so, preserves the original frequency while creating the new `DatetimeArray`. If the original `freq` is None, it creates the new `DatetimeArray` without setting the frequency.

This approach ensures that the frequency is correctly preserved after timezone localization.
