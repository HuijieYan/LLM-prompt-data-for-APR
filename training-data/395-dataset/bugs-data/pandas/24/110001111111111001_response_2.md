The error is likely occurring in the `tz_localize` method of the `DatetimeArray` class. The error message indicates that after localizing the datetime array to "US/Eastern" with `nonexistent="shift_forward"`, the frequency is not being set to None as expected.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the way the frequency is being handled during the localization process, especially in ambiguous cases with DST transitions.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the frequency is properly handled in ambiguous cases with DST transitions. This might involve explicitly setting the frequency to None in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... (existing code)

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
        new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
        
        # Set the frequency based on the ambiguous and nonexistent parameters
        if ambiguous in ('raise', 'NaT') or nonexistent in ('raise', 'NaT'):
            freq = None
        else:
            freq = self.freq

        dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
        return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

In this corrected code, the frequency is explicitly set to None when ambiguous or nonexistent cases result in frequencies that conflict with the expected behavior. This should resolve the issue and align with the expected behavior in the test case.
