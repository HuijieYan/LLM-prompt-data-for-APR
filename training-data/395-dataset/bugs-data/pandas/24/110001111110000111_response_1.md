The test case `test_tz_localize_invalidates_freq` checks that when localizing a DatetimeIndex to a different timezone with a DST transition, the frequency should become None if ambiguous or nonexistent times are created.

The error message indicates that the frequency is not being set to None when localizing to "US/Eastern" with `nonexistent="shift_forward"`. This means that the frequency inconsistency is taking place.

The potential error location in the buggy function is within the `tz_localize` method. When the `nonexistent` parameter is not handled correctly, it leads to the frequency inconsistency, as indicated in the test case.

The bug occurs because the localization process does not update the frequency to None when ambiguous or nonexistent times are created due to a DST transition, as expected by the test case.

To fix the bug, when localizing the DatetimeIndex to a new timezone, the code should check for ambiguous or nonexistent times and set the frequency to None if either of these conditions is met.

Here is the corrected code for the `tz_localize` method:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Convert to UTC
    new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
        self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
    )

    # Set frequency to None if ambiguous or nonexistent times are created
    has_ambiguous_times = ambiguous != "raise" and pd.isnull(ambiguous).any()
    has_nonexistent_times = nonexistent != "raise" and pd.isnull(nonexistent).any()

    if has_ambiguous_times or has_nonexistent_times:
        freq = None
    else:
        freq = self.freq

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

With this correction, the `tz_localize` method will correctly handle the setting of the frequency based on the presence of ambiguous or nonexistent times during the timezone localization process.
