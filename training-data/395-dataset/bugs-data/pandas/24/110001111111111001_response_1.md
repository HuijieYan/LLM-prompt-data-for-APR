The test case `test_tz_localize_invalidates_freq` is trying to ensure that the `tz_localize` method behaves correctly when converting a DatetimeIndex with a frequency to a different timezone, especially across DST transitions.

The error message indicates that the frequency attribute of the resulting DatetimeIndex, after being localized to "US/Eastern" timezone with `nonexistent="shift_forward"`, is not being set to `None` as expected.

Upon analyzing the buggy function `tz_localize`, it seems that the variable `freq` is not being handled appropriately across timezone localizations. The code is setting the frequency to `None` in cases where it should be preserved. This is causing the test failure.

The bug occurs because the handling of the frequency attribute is not consistent or appropriate when localizing the timezone.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the cases where the frequency should be preserved, and where it should be set to `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... rest of the code...

    # convert to UTC if the input timezone is not None
    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )

    # preserve the frequency if the timezone change is unambiguous
    if ambiguous == 'raise' and nonexistent == 'raise':
        freq = self.freq
    else:
        freq = None
        
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

The corrected code includes a conditional block to determine when to preserve the frequency and when to set it to `None` during the timezone localization. This should address the issue observed in the test case.
