The buggy code attempts to localize a tz-naive Datetime Array to a tz-aware Datetime Array. This process should convert timestamps to the specified time zone and handle ambiguous and nonexistent times. The bug seems to be caused by mishandling of time zones in the `tz_convert` method and the `dtype` method.

The potential error is located in the `tz_localize` method. There is an issue with handling the time zone properly. The code wrongly checks if the `self.tz` is not None. However, `tz` is the parameter that should be used for time zone conversion. Additionally, the conversion from UTC is not handled correctly.

To fix the bug, replace the `if self.tz is not None` statement with `if tz is None` to correctly check if the time zone is not specified. Then, perform the time zone localization with the correct time zone (`tz`) and handle the unconversion from UTC to the local zone, making sure to return a new instance of `DatetimeArray` with the correct time zone.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... existing code ...
    nonexistent_options = ("raise", "NaT", "shift_forward", "shift_backward")
    if nonexistent not in nonexistent_options and not isinstance(nonexistent, timedelta):
        raise ValueError(
            "The nonexistent argument must be one of 'raise', "
            "'NaT', 'shift_forward', 'shift_backward' or "
            "a timedelta object"
        )

    tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
    new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
        self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
    )

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=self.freq)
```

With these changes, the TZ localization should work correctly and handle the ambiguous or nonexistent times properly, returning a new instance of `DatetimeArray` localized to the specified time zone.
