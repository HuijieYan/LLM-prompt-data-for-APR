```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    """
    Localize tz-naive Datetime Array/Index to tz-aware
    Datetime Array/Index.

    This method takes a time zone (tz) naive Datetime Array/Index object
    and makes this time zone aware. It does not move the time to another
    time zone.
    Time zone localization helps to switch from time zone aware to time
    zone unaware objects.

    Returns
    -------
    Same type as self
        Array/Index converted to the specified time zone.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the Datetime Array/Index is tz-aware and tz is not None.
