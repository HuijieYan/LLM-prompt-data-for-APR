The bug occurs in the `tz_localize` method, where the frequency of the index is not properly handled when localizing the timezone.

The error message from the test function indicates that the frequency of the index after localizing to US/Eastern with the `nonexistent` parameter set to "shift_forward" is not being handled correctly. The result should have a frequency of None, but it is still "Hour" as shown in the assertion error.

The bug occurs because when localizing to US/Eastern with a shift in time due to DST, the frequency of the index is not being updated to None as it should be when timestamps are duplicated/missing.

To fix the bug, the `tz_localize` method should be updated to properly handle the frequency of the index after localizing to a new timezone. The method should check for cases where the frequency should be set to None, and update it accordingly.

Below is the corrected `tz_localize` method:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    """
    Localize tz-naive Datetime Array/Index to tz-aware Datetime Array/Index.
    This method takes a time zone (tz) naive Datetime Array/Index object
    and makes this time zone aware. It does not move the time to another
    time zone.
    Time zone localization helps to switch from time zone aware to time
    zone unaware objects.
    """
    nonexistent_options = ("raise", "NaT", "shift_forward", "shift_backward")
    if nonexistent not in nonexistent_options and not isinstance(nonexistent, timedelta):
        raise ValueError(
            "The nonexistent argument must be one of 'raise', 'NaT', 'shift_forward', 'shift_backward' or a timedelta object"
        )

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)

    if hasattr(self, "freq"):
        if nonexistent in ("shift_forward", "shift_backward"):
            # Update frequency based on DST transition
            freq = None
        else:
            freq = self.freq
        return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
    else:
        return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype)
```

In this corrected method, after the new dates are obtained post-localization, the frequency of the index is properly handled based on the `nonexistent` parameter. If the index frequency should be updated to None, it is handled accordingly.

This correction should resolve the issue of frequency inconsistency on time offset change when using the `tz_localize` method.
