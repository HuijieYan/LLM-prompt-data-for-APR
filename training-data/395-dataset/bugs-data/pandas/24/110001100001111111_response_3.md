The bug seems to be occurring because the tz_localize function is not updating the frequency of the index after localizing it to None, especially in the case of transitioning to or from Daylight Saving Time.

To fix this bug, the tz_localize function should update the frequency of the index after localizing it to None. This can be achieved by checking if the frequency is still consistent with the new localized index, and in the case of Daylight Saving Time switch, the frequency of the index should become None (since duplicated/missing timestamps are created).

Here's the corrected code for the tz_localize function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    """
    Localize tz-naive Datetime Array/Index to tz-aware
    Datetime Array/Index.

    This method takes a time zone (tz) naive Datetime Array/Index object
    and makes this time zone aware. It does not move the time to another
    time zone.
    Time zone localization helps to switch from time zone aware to time
    zone unaware objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tz : str, pytz.timezone, dateutil.tz.tzfile or None
        Time zone to convert timestamps to. Passing ``None`` will
        remove the time zone information preserving local time.
    ambiguous : 'infer', 'NaT', bool array, default 'raise'
        When clocks moved backward due to DST, ambiguous times may arise.
        For example in Central European Time (UTC+01), when going from
        03:00 DST to 02:00 non-DST, 02:30:00 local time occurs both at
        00:30:00 UTC and at 01:30:00 UTC. In such a situation, the
        `ambiguous` parameter dictates how ambiguous times should be
        handled.

        - 'infer' will attempt to infer fall dst-transition hours based on
          order
        - bool-ndarray where True signifies a DST time, False signifies a
          non-DST time (note that this flag is only applicable for
          ambiguous times)
        - 'NaT' will return NaT where there are ambiguous times
        - 'raise' will raise an AmbiguousTimeError if there are ambiguous
          times.

    nonexistent : 'shift_forward', 'shift_backward, 'NaT', timedelta, \
default 'raise'
        A nonexistent time does not exist in a particular timezone
        where clocks moved forward due to DST.

        - 'shift_forward' will shift the nonexistent time forward to the
          closest existing time
        - 'shift_backward' will shift the nonexistent time backward to the
          closest existing time
        - 'NaT' will return NaT where there are nonexistent times
        - timedelta objects will shift nonexistent times by the timedelta
        - 'raise' will raise an NonExistentTimeError if there are
          nonexistent times.

    Returns
    -------
    Same type as self
    Array/Index converted to the specified time zone.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
    If the Datetime Array/Index is tz-aware and tz is not None.

    DatetimeIndex.tz_convert : Convert tz-aware DatetimeIndex from
    one time zone to another.

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    freq = new_dates.inferred_freq if tz is None else self.freq
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)
```

This corrected code will update the frequency of the index after localizing it to None, ensuring that it is consistent with the new localized index.
