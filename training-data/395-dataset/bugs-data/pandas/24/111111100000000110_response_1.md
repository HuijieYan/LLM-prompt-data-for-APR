class DatetimeArray(dtl.DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, dtl.TimelikeOps, dtl.DatelikeOps):
    """
    Pandas ExtensionArray for tz-naive or tz-aware datetime data.
    
    .. versionadded:: 0.24.0
    
    .. warning::
    
       DatetimeArray is currently experimental, and its API may change
       without warning. In particular, :attr:`DatetimeArray.dtype` is
       expected to change to always be an instance of an ``ExtensionDtype``
       subclass.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    values : Series, Index, DatetimeArray, ndarray
        The datetime data.
    
        For DatetimeArray `values` (or a Series or Index boxing one),
        `dtype` and `freq` will be extracted from `values`.
    
    dtype : numpy.dtype or DatetimeTZDtype
        Note that the only NumPy dtype allowed is 'datetime64[ns]'.
    freq : str or Offset, optional
        The frequency.
    copy : bool, default False
        Whether to copy the underlying array of values.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    None
    
    Methods
    -------
    tz_localize : function
        Corrected function for localizing tz-naive Datetime Array/Index to tz-aware 
        Datetime Array/Index.

        Localize tz-naive Datetime Array/Index to tz-aware
        Datetime Array/Index.

        This method takes a time zone (tz) naive Datetime Array/Index object
        and makes this time zone aware. It does not move the time to another
        time zone.
        Time zone localization helps to switch from time zone aware to time
        zone unaware objects.
