The error occurs because the tz_localize method doesn't properly handle the frequency when the time offset changes due to daylight saving time transitions. When the time offset changes, the frequency of the index should become None since duplicated or missing timestamps are created, but the method fails to reset the frequency.

To fix the bug, the tz_localize method needs to properly handle the frequency when the time offset changes due to daylight saving time transitions. This can be achieved by resetting the frequency to None when this situation occurs.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged) ...

    if self.freq is not None:
        # Reset the frequency to None when the offset changes
        if nonexistent in ('shift_forward', 'shift_backward') or ambiguous == 'infer':
            freq = None

    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=freq)  # Update the frequency when creating a new index
```
In this correction, we check if the frequency needs to be reset to None based on the values of ambiguous and nonexistent options. If the frequency needs to be updated, it is set to None before creating the new index.
