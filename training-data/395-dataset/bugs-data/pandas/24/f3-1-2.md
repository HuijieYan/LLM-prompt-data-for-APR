The issue description is:

```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
import pandas as pd

index = pd.date_range("2019-3-31", freq="30T", periods=10, tz="Europe/London")
print(index)  # this has a freq
print(index.freq)
print(index.tz_localize(None))  # this shouldn't have it anymore, but it does
print(index.tz_localize(None).freq)
Problem description
tz_localize(None) doesn't check if the frequency is still consistent with the new localized index. In the case of Daylight Saving Time switch, the frequency of the index should become None (since duplicated/missing timestamps are created).

Expected Output
Achievable with:

new_index = index.tz_localize(None)
new_index.freq = new_index.inferred_freq  # drop frequency if not inferrable
print(new_index)  # this is correct
print(new_index.freq)
```
