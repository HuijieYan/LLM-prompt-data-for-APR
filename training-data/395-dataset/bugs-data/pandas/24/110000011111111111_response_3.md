The error occurs in the `test_tz_localize_invalidates_freq` function, specifically in the assertion `assert result.freq is None`. The test is expecting the frequency to be None after localizing the DatetimeIndex with the timezone `US/Eastern` and using `nonexistent="shift_forward"`. However, the actual frequency is `<Hour>`.

The bug is likely in the `tz_localize` method, where the frequency inconsistency occurs due to the handling of timezone changes. When the timezone is changed and daylight saving time shifts are involved, the frequency of the DatetimeIndex should become None. However, the method is not updating the frequency correctly in these cases, leading to the inconsistency observed in the test.

One approach to fix the bug is to modify the `tz_localize` method to correctly handle the frequency update when dealing with timezone changes that involve daylight saving time shifts. The method should update the frequency to None when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` method:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # existing code

    # ... (prior code)

    if self.tz is not None:
        if tz is None:
            new_dates = tzconversion.tz_convert(self.asi8, timezones.UTC, self.tz)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Already tz-aware, use tz_convert to convert.")
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        # Convert to UTC
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
        if ambiguous == 'infer' or nonexistent != 'raise':
            self.freq = None  # update the frequency to None
    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=self.freq)
```

With this correction, the `tz_localize` method should now update the frequency to None when needed, resolving the inconsistency observed in the test case.
