The test case `test_tz_localize_invalidates_freq` checks if the `tz_localize` method correctly preserves or invalidates the frequency of the DateTimeIndex. The error occurs when the frequency is incorrectly preserved after localizing the DateTimeIndex to a timezone that has a Daylight Saving Time transition.

The bug in the `tz_localize` method is related to how it handles frequency preservation. When localizing to a timezone with a Daylight Saving Time transition, the frequency should be set to `None` to prevent inconsistencies due to duplicated or missing timestamps. However, in the current implementation, the frequency is incorrectly preserved, leading to inconsistencies.

To fix this bug, the `tz_localize` method needs to be updated to correctly handle frequency preservation when localizing to timezones with Daylight Saving Time transitions. Specifically, when the `nonexistent` option is set to "shift_forward" or "shift_backward", the frequency of the resulting DateTimeIndex should be set to `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` method:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # existing code
    # ...

    if nonexistent in ("shift_forward", "shift_backward"):
        freq = None  # Set the frequency to None in case of nonexistent times
    else:
        freq = self.freq

    # existing code
    # ...
    return new_dates.asfreq(freq)
```

By updating the `tz_localize` method to correctly handle frequency preservation based on the `nonexistent` option, the bug can be fixed, and the test case `test_tz_localize_invalidates_freq` should pass without errors.

Finally, the GitHub issue related to this bug can be resolved by implementing the fix and providing the corrected behavior to the user.
