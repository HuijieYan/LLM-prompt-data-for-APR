The bug occurs in the `tz_localize` method where the frequency of the index is not being updated correctly when performing a localization that involves changes in time offsets, specifically during Daylight Saving Time transitions.

The reason behind this bug is that the frequency of the index is maintained during the `tz_localize(None)` operation, which is incorrect. The frequency should be updated to None in cases where duplicated or missing timestamps are created, such as during DST transitions.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `tz_localize` method to correctly handle the change in frequency when performing `tz_localize(None)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `tz_localize` method:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # existing code remains unchanged 

    # ... (other parts of the method)

    if tz is None:
        new_dates = self._round(freq=None)
    else:
        tz = timezones.maybe_get_tz(tz)
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )

    new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
    # set freq to None if duplicated or missing timestamps are created
    new_freq = getattr(new_dates, 'inferred_freq', None)
    return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=new_freq)

```

This change ensures that when performing `tz_localize(None)` if duplicated or missing timestamps are created, the frequency of the index is correctly updated to None.

After making this change, the `test_tz_localize_invalidates_freq` test case should pass without raising the AssertionError.
