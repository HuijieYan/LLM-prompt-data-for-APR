```python
    def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
        """
        Localize tz-naive Datetime Array/Index to tz-aware
        Datetime Array/Index.

        This method takes a time zone (tz) naive Datetime Array/Index object
        and makes this time zone aware. It does not move the time to another
        time zone.
        Time zone localization helps to switch from time zone aware to time
        zone unaware objects.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tz : str, pytz.timezone, dateutil.tz.tzfile or None
            Time zone to convert timestamps to. Passing ``None`` will
            remove the time zone information preserving local time.
        ambiguous : 'infer', 'NaT', bool array, default 'raise'
            When clocks moved backward due to DST, ambiguous times may arise.
            For example in Central European Time (UTC+01), when going from
            03:00 DST to 02:00 non-DST, 02:30:00 local time occurs both at
            00:30:00 UTC and at 01:30:00 UTC. In such a situation, the
            `ambiguous` parameter dictates how ambiguous times should be
            handled.

            - 'infer' will attempt to infer fall dst-transition hours based on
              order
              ...
        ...
