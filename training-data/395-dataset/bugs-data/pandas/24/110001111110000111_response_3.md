The error occurs when the `tz_localize` method is used, and the frequency attribute is not updated correctly, leading to inconsistency.

The potential error location is within the `tz_localize` method where the frequency attribute is not being updated correctly after localizing the timezone.

The bug occurs because the `tz_localize` method doesn't check if the frequency is still consistent with the new localized index. When there is a Daylight Saving Time switch, the frequency of the index should become None, but it does not.

To fix the bug, we need to update the method to check and update the frequency attribute after localizing the timezone. If the frequency is not inferrable, it should be set to None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
        # ... previous code ...

        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
        new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
        dtype = tz_to_dtype(tz)

        new_index = self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=dtype, freq=self.freq)

        if new_index.freq is not None:
            if tz is not None:
                new_index.freq = None  # drop frequency if tz-aware
            else:
                inferred_freq = new_index.inferred_freq
                if inferred_freq is not None:
                    new_index.freq = inferred_freq  # update frequency if inferrable

        return new_index
```
