Based on the error message, the `tz_localize` function is not correctly updating the frequency when localizing to "US/Eastern" time zone with the option `nonexistent="shift_forward"`. The frequency should become None, but it is not being updated properly.

The potential error location is in the `tz_localize` function, specifically when localizing to a time zone with the option `nonexistent="shift_forward"`. It is failing to update the frequency to None in this specific case.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case of `nonexistent="shift_forward"` properly, leading to the frequency inconsistency after localization.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case when `nonexistent="shift_forward"` is used and update the frequency to None if necessary.

Below is the corrected code for the `tz_localize` function:

```python
def tz_localize(self, tz, ambiguous="raise", nonexistent="raise"):
    # Previous code...

    # Check if nonexistent="shift_forward" and update frequency
    if nonexistent == "shift_forward":
        new_dates = conversion.tz_localize_to_utc(
            self.asi8, tz, ambiguous=ambiguous, nonexistent=nonexistent
        )
        new_dates = new_dates.view(DT64NS_DTYPE)
        return self._simple_new(new_dates, dtype=None, freq=None)

    # Previous code...
```

This fixes the bug by handling the case when `nonexistent="shift_forward"` is used and properly updates the frequency to None. This ensures that the frequency is consistent after localizing to the specified time zone.
