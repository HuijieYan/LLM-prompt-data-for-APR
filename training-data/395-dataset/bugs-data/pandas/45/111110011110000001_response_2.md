The error message from the test function indicates that the `pd.DataFrame` is not raising a `TypeError` as expected when the input dictionary contains a set as a value.

The potential error location within the `sanitize_array` function is not immediately clear as the function is long and contains multiple conditional blocks.

The bug is likely occurring due to the handling of sets within the `sanitize_array` function. The function should handle sets as values within the input dictionary and raise a `TypeError` if a set is encountered.

To fix the bug, the `sanitize_array` function should include a conditional block to handle sets within the input dictionary. When a set is encountered, it should raise a `TypeError` with an appropriate message.

The corrected code for the `sanitize_array` function, handling sets, is as follows:

```python
def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if isinstance(data, dict):
        for value in data.values():
            if isinstance(value, set):
                raise TypeError("Set type is unordered")

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This code includes a check to iterate through the values of the input dictionary and raise a `TypeError` with the appropriate message if a set is encountered.
