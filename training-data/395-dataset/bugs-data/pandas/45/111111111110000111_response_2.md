The error message indicates that the `pd.DataFrame({"a": {1, 2, 3}})` call did not raise the expected TypeError. This suggests that the `sanitize_array()` function is not working correctly when handling sets, leading to unexpected behavior in constructing a DataFrame.

Upon analyzing the function `sanitize_array()`, it seems that the issue may lie in the logic for handling different data types, as well as in handling sets specifically. The function tries to extract an ndarray or ExtensionArray, and then applies various checks, conversions, and casts based on the data type. However, the logic for handling sets might be missing or incorrect, which leads to the unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the `sanitize_array()` function does not have a specific handling mechanism for sets. As a result, when trying to create a DataFrame with a set as a value in the dictionary, the function incorrectly replicates the set n times, whereas it should treat the set as a single object.

To fix the bug, we need to add specific handling for sets within the `sanitize_array()` function. We should check for set objects and handle them appropriately to ensure that they are treated as single objects, rather than being replicated.

Here's the corrected `sanitize_array()` function:

```python
def sanitize_array(data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False):
    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if isinstance(data, set):
        # Convert the set to a list to ensure it is treated as a single object
        data = [data]

    # The rest of the function remains the same, with the handling for sets added

    # ... (previous logic)

    return subarr
```

By adding the specific handling for sets as shown above, the function will correctly treat sets as single objects, and the bug causing the unexpected replication of sets will be fixed.
