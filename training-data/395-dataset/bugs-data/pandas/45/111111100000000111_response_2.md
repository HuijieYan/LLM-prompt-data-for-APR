Potential Error Location:
The `sanitize_array` function is the likely location of the bug as it handles the conversion of input data to an ndarray, including handling different data types such as sets.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `sanitize_array` function does not handle sets in the expected way. When a set is passed as input, it is replicated multiple times instead of being treated as a single entity.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `sanitize_array` function needs to be updated to handle sets appropriately. Instead of replicating the set, it should treat it as a single entity and convert it to an ndarray accordingly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def sanitize_array(
        data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
    ):
        """
        Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
        dtype if specified.
        """
        if dtype is not None:
            dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    
        if isinstance(data, (list, tuple)):
            data = np.array(data)
        elif isinstance(data, range):
            arr = np.arange(data.start, data.stop, data.step, dtype="int64")
            data = np.array(arr)
        elif isinstance(data, set):
            data = np.array(list(data))

        if dtype is not None:
            data = _try_cast(data, dtype, copy, raise_cast_failure)
        else:
            if copy:
                data = data.copy()

        return data
```

In the corrected code, the `sanitize_array` function now correctly handles sets by converting them to a list before creating an ndarray. Additionally, it ensures that the dtype is appropriately handled based on the input data.
