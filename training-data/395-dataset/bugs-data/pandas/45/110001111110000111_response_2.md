The error message from the test function indicates that the code did not raise a TypeError as expected. This suggests that the function pd.DataFrame is not correctly handling the input '{1, 2, 3}' as a set.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `sanitize_array` function, where the input data is being sanitized to an ndarray. It seems that the conversion of a set to a DataFrame is not being handled correctly in this function.

The bug occurred because the `sanitize_array` function was not properly handling sets as input. When the function encountered a set as input, it was replicating the set n times, where n is the length of the set, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `sanitize_array` function needs to be modified to handle sets as input correctly. When the input data is a set, it should be converted directly to a DataFrame without replicating it. This will ensure that the set is not replicated n times, and the expected behavior is achieved.

The corrected function for the problematic `sanitize_array` function:

```python
def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if isinstance(data, set):
        data = pd.DataFrame(data)
    elif isinstance(data, ma.MaskedArray):
        # ... (existing code for handling MaskedArray)
        pass
    # ... (existing code for handling other data types)

    return data
```

With this modification, the `sanitize_array` function will correctly handle sets as input and convert them directly to a DataFrame without replicating them. This will resolve the issue with creating a column with a set replicating the set n times.
