The test case 'test_construction_from_set_raises' is trying to create a DataFrame using a set as a value for a column. The expected behavior is that it should raise a TypeError because sets are unordered. However, the error message indicates that the TypeError was not raised as expected.

The potential error location within the 'sanitize_array' function is in the block of code where it handles the case for sets. It seems that the function does not properly handle the input data when it is a set.

The reason behind the bug is that the 'sanitize_array' function is not handling sets as input data correctly, which leads to the incorrect behavior observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, the 'sanitize_array' function needs to handle sets as input data explicitly. Specifically, it should raise a TypeError when encountering a set as input data to match the expected behavior in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the 'sanitize_array' function:

```python
def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # handle sets explicitly
    if isinstance(data, set):
        raise TypeError("Set type is unordered")

    # rest of the code remains unchanged...
```
