The error message indicates that the test case `test_construction_from_set_raises` did not raise a `TypeError` as expected. The test case is attempting to create a DataFrame from a dictionary containing a set `{1, 2, 3}`.

Upon analyzing the error message and the test case, it appears that the issue is related to the handling of sets when creating a DataFrame.

The potential error location within the `sanitize_array` function is in the logic that processes the input data. This function is responsible for sanitizing input data and ensuring it is in the correct format and type.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling sets in the `sanitize_array` function is not correctly processing sets when creating a DataFrame. As a result, the set is being replicated multiple times instead of being handled as a single set.

To fix the bug, the `sanitize_array` function needs to be updated to correctly handle sets when creating a DataFrame. It should ensure that sets are not replicated and are handled as single entities.

Below is the corrected code for the `sanitize_array` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import pandas_dtype

def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    
    if isinstance(data, set):
        data = np.array(list(data))

    if isinstance(data, (list, tuple)):
        data = np.array(data)

    return data
```

In this corrected code:
1. The function checks if the input data is a set. If it is, the set is converted into a numpy array using `np.array(list(data))`.
2. If the data is a list or tuple, it is also converted into a numpy array using `np.array(data)`.

This corrected code should handle sets, lists, and tuples appropriately when creating a DataFrame and prevent the issue of sets being replicated.
