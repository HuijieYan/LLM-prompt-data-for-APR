The test_construction_from_set_raises function is trying to create a DataFrame using a set as a value, and it expects this operation to raise a TypeError with the message "Set type is unordered". However, the function does not raise the expected error, which indicates a bug in the sanitize_array function.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of sets within the sanitize_array function. It's possible that the function is not properly handling sets when attempting to convert them to an ndarray.

To fix the bug, the sanitize_array function needs to properly handle sets as input data. It should raise a TypeError with the message "Set type is unordered" when encountering a set as input.

Here's the corrected sanitize_array function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pandas.api.types as lib

def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if isinstance(data, set):
        raise TypeError("Set type is unordered")
        
    # other parts of the function remain unchanged
    # ...

```

In the corrected function, we added a check for sets and raised a TypeError with the appropriate message. This change will ensure that the function properly handles sets as input data and raises the expected error when encountered.
