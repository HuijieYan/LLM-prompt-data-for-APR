The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `pd.DataFrame` function when it encounters a set as a value in the dictionary.

The potential error location within the sanitize_array function is likely around the logic that handles set/array-like data types.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling sets as input data correctly. When creating a DataFrame with a dictionary containing a set, the set is being replicated n times, where n is the length of the set. This is unexpected behavior as it does not align with the behavior when using a list or other data types.

To fix the bug, the function should handle sets as input data in a way that aligns with the expected behavior for creating DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the sanitize_array function:

```python
def sanitize_array(
    data, index, dtype=None, copy: bool = False, raise_cast_failure: bool = False
):
    """
    Sanitize input data to an ndarray, copy if specified, coerce to the
    dtype if specified.
    """
    if isinstance(data, set):  # handle sets as input data
        data = list(data)  # convert set to list

    if dtype is not None:
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    # rest of the function logic remains unchanged
    ...
```

By adding the specific handling for sets at the beginning of the function, we ensure that sets are converted to lists before proceeding with the rest of the logic. This should prevent the unexpected behavior observed with the `pd.DataFrame` function.
