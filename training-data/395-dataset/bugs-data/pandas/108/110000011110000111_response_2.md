The buggy function `infer_dtype_from_scalar` is not correctly inferring the dtype for Interval objects when `pandas_dtype` is set to True. As a result, the test cases are failing with AssertionError because the expected dtype is not being returned.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies within the block that handles instances of Interval. The function is not inferring the correct dtype when the input is an Interval object and `pandas_dtype` is set to True.

The reason behind this bug is that the function does not have logic to handle Interval objects when `pandas_dtype` is True. As a result, it defaults to returning `numpy.object_` as the dtype, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we should include logic to handle Interval objects when `pandas_dtype` is True and return the correct dtype for Interval objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `infer_dtype_from_scalar` function with the bug fixed:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import Interval, Timestamp, Timedelta, IntervalDtype

def infer_dtype_from_scalar(val, pandas_dtype: bool = False):
    dtype = np.object_

    if isinstance(val, pd.Interval):
        if pandas_dtype:
            # Infer the dtype as IntervalDtype with subtype
            subtype = val.right.dtype
            dtype = IntervalDtype(subtype=subtype)
        else:
            dtype = np.object_, val

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    ...

    return dtype, val
```

With this corrected code, the `infer_dtype_from_scalar` function will correctly infer the dtype for Interval objects when `pandas_dtype` is set to True, and the test cases should pass without any AssertionErrors.
