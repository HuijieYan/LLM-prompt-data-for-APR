The function `infer_dtype_from_scalar` seems to have a few issues:
1. The function is not properly handling certain input types such as `Interval`, `Timedelta`, and `Timestamp`.
2. The function uses the variable `val` without checking its actual type, leading to mismatched comparisons.
3. The cases for `Interval`, `Timedelta`, and `Timestamp` need to be corrected to handle pandas extension types properly.

To fix the function, we can explicitly check the types of the `val` parameter and handle each type separately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs import Timestamp, Timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT as tslibs_NaT
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaTType as tslibs_NaTType
from pandas._libs.tslibs import (period as lib, Timedelta as tslibs_Timedelta,
                                 Timestamp as tslibs_Timestamp)
from pandas._libs.tslibs import tslib as libts


def infer_dtype_from_scalar(val, pandas_dtype: bool = False):
    """
    Interpret the dtype from a scalar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pandas_dtype : bool, default False
        whether to infer dtype including pandas extension types.
        If False, scalar belongs to pandas extension types is inferred as
        object
    """

    dtype = np.object_

    if isinstance(val, (tslibs_Timestamp, Timestamp)):
        val = tslibs_Timestamp(val)
        if val is tslibs_NaT or val.tz is None:
            dtype = np.dtype("M8[ns]")
        else:
            if pandas_dtype:
                dtype = libts.DatetimeTZDtype(unit="ns", tz=val.tz)
            else:
                return np.object_, val
        val = val.value

    elif isinstance(val, (tslibs_Timedelta, Timedelta)):
        val = tslibs_Timedelta(val).value
        dtype = np.dtype("m8[ns]")

    elif pandas_dtype:
        if lib.is_period(val):
            dtype = libts.PeriodDtype(freq=val.freq)
            val = val.ordinal

    return dtype, val
```
This corrected function explicitly handles the various pandas extension types and adjusts the `dtype` and `val` values accordingly based on the input type.
