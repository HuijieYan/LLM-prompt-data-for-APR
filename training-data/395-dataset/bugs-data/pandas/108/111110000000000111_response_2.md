Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the section of the code that handles `pd.Interval` objects.

Reasons behind the bug:
- The function `infer_dtype_from_scalar` is written to infer the data type from a scalar value, including pandas extension types. However, the implementation for `pd.Interval` objects is not correctly handling the `pandas_dtype` parameter.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- We need to update the code to correctly handle the `pd.Interval` objects when `pandas_dtype` is set to True. This involves checking for `pd.Interval` objects and assigning the appropriate dtype (IntervalDtype) based on the `pandas_dtype` parameter.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas._libs.tslibs as tslibs
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas.api.types import is_bool, is_integer, is_float, is_complex
from pandas.api.extensions import ExtensionDtype, register_extension_dtype
from pandas.tseries.offsets import to_offset

def infer_dtype_from_scalar(val, pandas_dtype: bool = False):
    """
    Interpret the dtype from a scalar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pandas_dtype : bool, default False
        whether to infer dtype including pandas extension types.
        If False, scalar belongs to pandas extension types is inferred as
        object
    """

    dtype = np.object_

    if isinstance(val, pd.Interval) and pandas_dtype:
        dtype = pd.IntervalDtype(subtype=np.int64)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return dtype, val
```

In the corrected code, we have added a specific check for `pd.Interval` objects when `pandas_dtype` is True, and assigned the appropriate dtype as `pd.IntervalDtype(subtype=np.int64)`. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
