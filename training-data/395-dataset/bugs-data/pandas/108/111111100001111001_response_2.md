The issue with the function `infer_dtype_from_scalar` is that it is not handling all the input types correctly and there is also inconsistency in the return values. 

The error message mentions that an invalid `ndarray` is passed to the function, which indicates that the function is not properly handling `np.ndarray` inputs.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to handle all input types correctly and ensure that the return values are consistent.

Here's the corrected code for the `infer_dtype_from_scalar` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs import Timestamp
from pandas.errors import IncompatibleFrequency

def infer_dtype_from_scalar(val, pandas_dtype: bool = False):
    if isinstance(val, (np.ndarray, np.number)):
        dtype = val.dtype
        val = np.asscalar(val)
    elif isinstance(val, str):
        dtype = np.object_
    elif isinstance(val, (np.datetime64, Timestamp)):
        val = Timestamp(val)
        dtype = np.dtype("M8[ns]")
    elif isinstance(val, (np.timedelta64, timedelta)):
        dtype = np.dtype("m8[ns]")
    elif isinstance(val, bool):
        dtype = np.bool_
    elif isinstance(val, int):
        dtype = np.int64
    elif isinstance(val, float):
        dtype = np.float64
    elif isinstance(val, complex):
        dtype = np.complex_
    else:
        dtype = np.object_
        
    return dtype, val
```

In the corrected code:
1. We handle np.ndarray inputs separately and use `np.asscalar` to convert it to a scalar value.
2. We're not checking for pandas extension types explicitly, as the original code had a parameter `pandas_dtype` which could control the inference of such types. We also use `np.number` to handle different numeric types.
3. We're consistently returning the `dtype` and `val` regardless of the input type, to ensure the return values are always in the same format.

These changes will address the inconsistencies and ensure that the function handles different input types correctly.
