The error message occurs when trying to merge two DataFrames using the `pd.merge_asof` function with a specific tolerance and direction. The error message indicates that the tolerance is not compatible with the data type of the merge keys.

The issue in the provided function `_get_merge_keys` is that it doesn't handle the data type of the merge keys properly when checking for compatibility with the tolerance. The current implementation raises a `MergeError` without considering different data types that could be encountered.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the data type check and tolerance validation. This can be achieved by checking the data type of the merge keys and ensuring that the tolerance is compatible with the data type before proceeding with the merge operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    if self.tolerance is not None:
        # validate tolerance; must be compatible with the data type of merge keys
        if any(isinstance(lk.dtype, type) for lk in left_join_keys for type in [np.datetime64, np.float64, int]):
            # ensure tolerance is a Timedelta if the merge keys are of datetime64, float, or integer type
            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
                raise MergeError("Tolerance must be a Timedelta")

    # validate allow_exact_matches
    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
        raise MergeError(msg.format(passed=self.allow_exact_matches))

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected implementation, the tolerance is checked for compatibility with the data type of the merge keys, and appropriate exceptions are raised if the tolerance is not compatible. Additionally, the function ensures that `allow_exact_matches` is a boolean and raises a `MergeError` if it's not.
