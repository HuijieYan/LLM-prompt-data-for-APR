Potential error location:
The error message "incompatible tolerance {tolerance}, must be compat with type {lkdtype}" indicates that there is an issue with validating the tolerance. It seems to be specifically related to the type of the left join key.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the index is a TimedeltaIndex when validating the tolerance. It only checks for cases where the index is a datetime or integer type, leading to the error message and incorrect behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the code needs to include a validation check specifically for the TimedeltaIndex type to handle the tolerance. This involves checking if the left join key is a TimedeltaIndex and ensuring that the tolerance is compatible with this type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                # for them here.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )

            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
                raise MergeError("incompatible tolerance {tolerance}, must be compatible with type Timedelta")
            if self.tolerance < Timedelta(0):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")
        else:
            # Existing tolerance validation code for other types remains unchanged
            # ...

    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
