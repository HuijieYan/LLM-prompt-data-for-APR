The error is occurring in the `_get_merge_keys` function of the `_AsOfMerge` class due to a validation check for the tolerance value. The function is checking the type of tolerance and raising an error if it doesn't match the expected type, which leads to the `MergeError` being raised with the message "key must be integer, timestamp or float".

To fix this bug, the validation logic for the tolerance value needs to be modified. The function should only check for the tolerance value if it is not None. Additionally, it should only raise an error if the tolerance is not of type `Timedelta` and the left index is of type `datetime64`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):

    # ... (omitted code)

    # note this function has side effects
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                #
                # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                # for them here.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate tolerance; must be a Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if is_datetime64_dtype(left_join_keys[-1]) and not isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
            raise MergeError("Tolerance must be a Timedelta when merging on datetime-like objects.")

        if isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta) and self.tolerance < Timedelta(0):
            raise MergeError("Tolerance must be a positive Timedelta")

    # validate allow_exact_matches
    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
        raise MergeError(msg.format(passed=self.allow_exact_matches))

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```
