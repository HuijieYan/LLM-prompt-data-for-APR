The error occurs when the `pd.merge_asof` function is used with the `tolerance` parameter on a DataFrame with a `TimedeltaIndex`. The error message specifically mentions that "key must be integer, timestamp or float."

The bug is likely located in the `_get_merge_keys` function of the `_AsOfMerge` class. The function is not handling the case where the index is a `Timedelta`. It tries to validate the tolerance based on the index type, which leads to the error.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_get_merge_keys` function does not have proper handling for `TimedeltaIndex` when validating the tolerance.

To fix the bug, the `_get_merge_keys` function should be modified to correctly handle the case where the index is a `TimedeltaIndex`. It should perform tolerance validation based on the type of index (`DatetimeIndex` or `TimedeltaIndex`).

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # validate index types are the same
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                #
                # In this function, the join keys include both the original
                # ones of the merge_asof() call, and also the keys passed
                # to its by= argument. Unordered but equal categories
                # are not supported for the former, but will fail
                # later with a ValueError, so we don't *need* to check
                # for them here.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # validate tolerance
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if isinstance(self.left.index, TimedeltaIndex):
            if not isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be a Timedelta")
            if self.tolerance < Timedelta(0):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")
        else:
            # For DatetimeIndex or other types, perform the existing tolerance validation
            # ...

    # validate allow_exact_matches
    if not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        msg = "allow_exact_matches must be boolean, passed {passed}"
        raise MergeError(msg.format(passed=self.allow_exact_matches))

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In this corrected code, the tolerance validation is extended to check if the index is a `TimedeltaIndex`. If it is, it specifically checks for `Timedelta` type and positivity of the tolerance. Otherwise, it performs the existing tolerance validation for other index types.
