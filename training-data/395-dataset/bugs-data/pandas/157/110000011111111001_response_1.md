**Analysis:**

In this case, the buggy function is `_get_merge_keys`. The error message indicates that the code inside the conditional block for checking tolerance is not functioning as expected. It raises a `MergeError` with the message "key must be integer, timestamp or float", implying that the tolerance is not being handled correctly within the function.

**Reasons for the Bug:**

The bug occurs due to the mishandling of tolerance types. The conditional checks for different types of data (datetime64, int64, and float) are not handling the `Timedelta` type, leading to the incorrect exception being raised.

**Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:**

1. Check if the tolerance is a `Timedelta` and handle it accordingly based on the provided business logic.
2. If a `Timedelta` is not handled correctly within the existing conditional checks, introduce a separate conditional block to handle the `Timedelta` type for tolerance.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # ... [existing code]

    # validate tolerance; must be a Timedelta if we have a DTI
    if self.tolerance is not None:
        if isinstance(self.tolerance, Timedelta):  # New conditional check for Timedelta
            if self.tolerance < Timedelta(0):
                raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")
        else:
            lt = self.left.index if self.left_index else left_join_keys[-1]
            msg = "incompatible tolerance {tolerance}, must be compat with type {lkdtype}".format(
                tolerance=type(self.tolerance), lkdtype=repr(lt.dtype)
            )
            if is_datetime64_dtype(lt) or is_datetime64tz_dtype(lt):
                raise MergeError(msg)  # Handle as before
            elif is_int64_dtype(lt):
                if not is_integer(self.tolerance) or self.tolerance < 0:
                    raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")
            elif is_float_dtype(lt):
                if not is_number(self.tolerance) or self.tolerance < 0:
                    raise MergeError("tolerance must be positive")
            else:
                raise MergeError("key must be integer, timestamp or float")

    # ... [existing code]
```

In the corrected code, a new conditional check for `Timedelta` type is added to validate the tolerance. If the tolerance is a `Timedelta`, it is checked for positivity. Otherwise, the existing conditional logic for different types is applied as before. This approach ensures that the `Timedelta` type is handled correctly within the tolerance validation process.
