The bug is occurring in the `_get_merge_keys` method of the `_AsOfMerge` class. The bug is triggered by the attempt to use the `tolerance` flag when the index is a `Timedelta`.

The issue arises because when the index of the left DataFrame is a `TimedeltaIndex`, the comparison with the `tolerance` value may not work as intended. The tolerance needs to be compatible with the type of the index.

To fix this bug, the code needs to handle cases where the index type is `Timedelta`. It should only perform tolerance checks if the index is of type `datetime` or any other compatible type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_merge_keys` method:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    if self.tolerance is not None and not is_datetime64_dtype(left_join_keys):
        raise MergeError("Tolerance is only supported when the index is of type datetime")
    elif self.allow_exact_matches is not None and not is_bool(self.allow_exact_matches):
        raise MergeError("allow_exact_matches must be boolean")
    else:
        return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `tolerance` should be compared based on the type of the `left_join_keys`. If it's not of type `datetime`, we raise an error. Otherwise, we proceed with the comparison. Similarly, we check the type of `allow_exact_matches` and raise an error if it's not a boolean.

This fix ensures that the tolerance comparison is only performed when the index is of the appropriate type, avoiding the error caused by incompatible types.
