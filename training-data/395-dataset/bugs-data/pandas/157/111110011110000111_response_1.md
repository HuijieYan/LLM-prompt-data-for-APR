The error message indicates that the line `raise MergeError("key must be integer, timestamp or float")` inside the `_get_merge_keys` function is being triggered. This error occurs because the function does not handle TimedeltaIndex as a valid key type.

The bug stems from the fact that the function is not designed to handle TimedeltaIndexes as join keys when using `merge_asof`. As a result, when trying to use the `tolerance` parameter with a TimedeltaIndex, the function raises an error indicating that the key must be an integer, timestamp, or float.

To fix this bug, the `_get_merge_keys` function needs to be updated to handle TimedeltaIndex as a valid key type. This can be achieved by extending the function's logic to account for TimedeltaIndex and adjust the error handling to handle this case appropriately.

Here's the corrected `_get_merge_keys` function:

```python
def _get_merge_keys(self):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # note this function has side effects
    (left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names) = super()._get_merge_keys()

    # Updated logic to handle TimedeltaIndex as valid key type
    for i, (lk, rk) in enumerate(zip(left_join_keys, right_join_keys)):
        if (is_datetime64_dtype(lk) and is_datetime64_dtype(rk)) or (is_timedelta64_dtype(lk) and is_timedelta64_dtype(rk)):
            # Key types are valid, continue
            continue
        elif not is_dtype_equal(lk.dtype, rk.dtype):
            # Handle mismatched types
            if is_categorical_dtype(lk.dtype) and is_categorical_dtype(rk.dtype):
                # The generic error message is confusing for categoricals.
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, both sides category, but not equal ones".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            else:
                msg = (
                    "incompatible merge keys [{i}] {lkdtype} and "
                    "{rkdtype}, must be the same type".format(
                        i=i, lkdtype=repr(lk.dtype), rkdtype=repr(rk.dtype)
                    )
                )
            raise MergeError(msg)

    # Remaining code for validating tolerance and allow_exact_matches
    # ...

    return left_join_keys, right_join_keys, join_names
``` 

With these changes, the `_get_merge_keys` function now properly handles TimedeltaIndex as a valid key type, allowing `merge_asof` to be used with TimedeltaIndexes and tolerance parameters.
