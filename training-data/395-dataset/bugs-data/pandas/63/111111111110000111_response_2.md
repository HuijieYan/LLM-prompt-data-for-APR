The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The error is raised when the method is used for the `.at` accessor, specifically when `is_integer(i)` returns False.

The problem arises because the `_convert_key` method does not handle the case when the index is an integer and the key is a non-integer properly. The method incorrectly raises a ValueError in this case.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_convert_key` method to properly handle the case when the index is an integer and the key is a non-integer. We can check if the index is an integer and if the key is not an integer, then we can raise a TypeError instead of a ValueError.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` method is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this modification, the `_convert_key` method will generate a TypeError instead of a ValueError when an integer index has a non-integer key, ensuring consistent behavior between `at` and `loc` accessors.
