The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function. The function is currently designed to check if the index is an integer and then check if the key is an integer. However, the current implementation does not consider the scenario where the key is not an integer but the index is. This leads to inconsistent behavior when using the `at` and `loc` methods.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function should be modified to check for non-integer indexes and non-integer keys. If the index is non-integer, the key must also be non-integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This fix ensures that the behavior of `at` and `loc` methods is consistent and aligns with the expected behavior according to the test case provided.
