The error is likely occurring in the for loop where the function is iterating through the axes and the key. The function is supposed to check if the key is of the same type as the index, and if not, raise a ValueError.

The issue seems to be with the logic of determining the data type and subsequently raising errors based on the data type of the index and key.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the logic in the for loop to correctly check the data type of the index and key, and raise the appropriate error if they are not compatible.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):  # check if key is an integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):  # check if key is a non-integer
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, the `is_integer()` method has been replaced with `isinstance()` to properly check if the key is of the same type as the index. The logic to raise the ValueError has been adjusted accordingly to ensure that the appropriate error is raised based on the data type of the index and key.
