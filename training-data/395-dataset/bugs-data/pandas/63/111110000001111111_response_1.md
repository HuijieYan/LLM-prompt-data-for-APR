Potential error location: The potential error location is within the for loop in the _convert_key function. The loop iterates through the axes and corresponding key elements to check for consistency in data types between the axes and key.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the comparison logic inside the loop is not consistently checking for data types. Additionally, the error messages in the test case suggest that the behavior of df.at[0] should be similar to df.loc[0], indicating a discrepancy in the behavior of the at and loc methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the comparison logic inside the for loop to consistently check for data types and raise appropriate error messages.
2. Ensure that the behavior of df.at[0] aligns with df.loc[0] to provide consistent indexing functionality.
3. Consider the data types of both the axes and the key elements to determine if the indexer is valid for the given operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In the corrected code, the comparison logic has been updated to consistently check for data types. The error messages have been aligned with the expected behavior of the at method, ensuring consistent indexing functionality.
