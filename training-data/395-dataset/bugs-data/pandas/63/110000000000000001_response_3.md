Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the section that checks if the index is integer or non-integer, as there are errors in the condition checks.

Reasons for the bug: 
1. The function is trying to determine if the index is of integer type or non-integer type, but the condition checks are using incorrect methods and are not thorough enough.
2. The conditions are not checking for all possible scenarios and are not handling the cases properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct methods to check for integer and non-integer types.
2. Add more thorough condition checks to cover all possible scenarios.
3. Improve the error messages to provide more detailed information.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Index)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code:
1. We have used `isinstance` method to check if the index is of integer type or non-integer type.
2. Added more thorough condition checks to cover all possible scenarios.
3. Improved the error messages to provide more detailed information.
