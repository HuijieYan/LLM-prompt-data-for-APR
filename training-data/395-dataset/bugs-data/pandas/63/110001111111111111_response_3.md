Potential error location: The issue is likely occurring in the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The error is raised when attempting to use `df.at[0]`, indicating that there may be inconsistency between the behavior of `.at` and `.loc`.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be related to the handling of non-integer indexes. The `.at` method is intended for label-based indexing, but it is throwing a ValueError related to non-integer indexing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One possible approach is to ensure that the behavior of `.at` and `.loc` is consistent. This could involve updating the logic inside the `_convert_key` method to properly handle non-integer indexes for both `.at` and `.loc`.

Corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    ax = self.obj.index
    for i in key:
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code ensures that the behavior for non-integer indexes is consistent between `.at` and `.loc` by checking the properties of the index and the type of the key.
