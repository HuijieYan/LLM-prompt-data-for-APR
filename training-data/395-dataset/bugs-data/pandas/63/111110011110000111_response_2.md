The error is occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. The error message indicates that there is inconsistency between the behavior of the `at` and `loc` methods. The `at` method is raising a `ValueError` while the `loc` method is raising a `TypeError`.

The reason behind this bug is that the logic in the `_convert_key` function is not handling the input key properly, leading to inconsistent error messages.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is being handled consistently for both `at` and `loc` methods. This can be achieved by properly checking the data type and the type of the index in the `_convert_key` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this corrected code, the behavior of the `at` and `loc` methods will be consistent, and the inconsistent error messages related to data type mismatches will be resolved.
