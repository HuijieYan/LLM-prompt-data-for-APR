Potential Error Location: The error could be occurring in the if-else conditions that check the type of the index keys and their compatibility with the axis.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug may be caused due to incorrect condition checking or type mismatches in the if-else conditions that are used to validate the index keys.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the `isinstance()` function to check the type of index keys and ensure they match the index type.
2. Use `try-except` blocks to capture and handle type mismatches or invalid index key types.
3. Refactor the condition checks to make them more readable and accurate.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
