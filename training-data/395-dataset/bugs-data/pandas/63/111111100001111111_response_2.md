The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` function. The function is intended to convert the key to be the same type as the index. However, the check for integer and non-integer types is not working as expected, leading to inconsistent errors in `at` and `loc` function calls.

The bug occurs because of the incorrect handling of index types in the `_convert_key` function. The function should check the type of the key and compare it with the type of the index to ensure consistency. However, the current implementation does not handle the type checking correctly, leading to inconsistent error messages.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the type checking of the index and the key.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            if not isinstance(ax, (pd.Int64Index, pd.UInt64Index, pd.Float64Index)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not (isinstance(ax, (pd.Index, pd.RangeIndex)) and
                    not isinstance(ax, (pd.Int64Index, pd.UInt64Index, pd.Float64Index))):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code includes proper type checking for the index and the key, ensuring consistent error messages between `at` and `loc` function calls.
