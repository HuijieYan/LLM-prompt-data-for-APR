The bug occurs when the function `_convert_key` attempts to iterate over the `key` but does not take into account that the `key` may be a tuple. This causes an error message to be raised when attempting to iterate over a non-iterable value.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if `key` is a tuple, and if so, convert it to a list before iterating over it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key) if isinstance(key, tuple) else key

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This should address the issue and allow the function to handle both tuples and lists as `key` inputs.
