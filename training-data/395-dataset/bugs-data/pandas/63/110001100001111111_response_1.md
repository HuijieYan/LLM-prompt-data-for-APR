Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the logic that checks the type of the index and key. The function is not handling the case where the index is non-integer and the key is an integer properly.

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring because the logic to handle non-integer keys when the index is non-integer is not implemented correctly. This leads to inconsistent behavior between `loc` and `at` methods.

Approach for fixing the bug: The logic needs to be updated to handle non-integer keys properly when the index is also non-integer. This will ensure consistent behavior between `loc` and `at` methods.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index, or handle non-integer keys properly.
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() or ax.is_floating():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code properly handles the case where the index is non-integer and the key is also non-integer, ensuring consistent behavior between `loc` and `at` methods.
