The error occurs when the `ser.at[0]` line is executed in the test function. It seems that the error is related to improper handling of indexing in the `_convert_key` method.

The issue arises because the `_convert_key` method is not handling the integer and non-integer type checking properly. The method is supposed to ensure that the keys are the same type as the index, but it is throwing a `ValueError` in a case where it should actually be a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` method to handle the type checking correctly and raise the appropriate error (TypeError instead of ValueError).

Here is the corrected `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` method should now handle type checking correctly and raise a `TypeError` instead of a `ValueError` in cases where the type of the index and key do not match.
