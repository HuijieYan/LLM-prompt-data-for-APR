Potential error location: The issue might be occurring in the for loop where the function checks if the index is of the same type as the index. 

Reason for the bug: The bug might be happening because the function is using an incorrect method "is_integer()" which is not a standard method for checking the type of the index.

Possible fix: We need to use the "isinstance()" method to check the type of the index instead of "is_integer()".

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
@Appender(IndexingMixin.at.__doc__)
class _AtIndexer(_ScalarAccessIndexer):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
        """
        Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
        fallback)
        """
        # allow arbitrary setting
        if is_setter:
            return list(key)
    
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
            elif not isinstance(i, int) and (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        return key
```
