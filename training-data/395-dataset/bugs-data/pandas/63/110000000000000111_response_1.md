Potential error location: The error seems to arise in the code block that checks whether the index is an integer or not, and then raises a ValueError based on that condition.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be caused by inconsistencies in how the `at` and `loc` methods handle indexing on non-integer indexes. The `at` method is raising a ValueError, while the `loc` method is raising a TypeError. This inconsistency in error messages and behavior is not expected and can lead to confusion for users.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `at` and `loc` methods handle indexing on non-integer indexes consistently, either by raising the same type of error or by providing clear and consistent error messages.
2. Update the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes and indexers consistently for both the `at` and `loc` methods.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, I have used `isinstance(i, int)` instead of `is_integer(i)` to check if the index is an integer. This should help in ensuring consistent handling of non-integer indexes and indexers for both the `at` and `loc` methods.
