The bug occurs because the function is attempting to call methods `is_integer()`, `holds_integer()`, and `is_floating()` on the `Index` object, but it is not using the correct object to call these methods. This is causing AttributeError or method missing errors, and may also lead to incorrect type checking for the index and key.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the correct object to call the methods `is_integer()`, `holds_integer()`, and `is_floating()` to perform type checking on the index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.NumericIndex):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (int, float)) and not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.numeric.NumericIndex):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
