The issue with the provided function is that it is not correctly handling the case when 'is_setter' is False. The function is intended to convert the 'key' into the appropriate format, but it is only checking for the 'is_setter' flag and returning the key as a list without performing the necessary checks when 'is_setter' is False.

The error message and the test case indicate that there is inconsistency between the behavior of `at` and `loc` methods. The bug seems to be related to the type of index and how the function handles the conversion of the key.

To fix the bug, the function should perform the necessary checks for the index type and handle the conversion of the key appropriately. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check for the type of index and the type of key. If the index is non-integer, then the function should ensure that the key is also non-integer. Likewise, if the index is integer, then the key should be an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code includes checks for the type of the index and the type of the key, ensuring that they are consistent with each other based on whether the index is integer or non-integer.
