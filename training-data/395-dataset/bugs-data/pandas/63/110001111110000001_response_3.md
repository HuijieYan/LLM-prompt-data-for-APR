The test case is attempting to use the `.at` indexing method on a Series, which is a method for strictly label-based indexing. The error message indicates that the bug is occurring within the `_convert_key` method in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file.

The bug is caused by a conditional check in the `_convert_key` method that is not correctly handling non-integer indexes. The error message specifically mentions the line where the ValueError is raised for non-integer indexes, indicating that this is the point of failure.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for non-integer indexes needs to be modified to correctly handle the different index types. This could involve checking the type of the index and ensuring that the indexer aligns with the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, (int, np.integer)):
            if not ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not ax.is_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we use `isinstance` to check if the indexer `i` is an integer or a floating point number, and then handle the appropriate error cases accordingly.
