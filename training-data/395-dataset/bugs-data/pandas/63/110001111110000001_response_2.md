The test case `test_series_at_raises_type_error` is testing the behavior of the `at` and `loc` methods on a `Series` object. The `at` method is expected to raise a `TypeError` with a specific error message when trying to index with an integer on a non-integer index.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function in `pandas/core/indexing.py` is the block that checks for integer indexing on non-integer indexes. The code is raising a `ValueError` in this block, which is consistent with the error message from the test case.

The bug occurs because the code is not correctly handling the case when integer indexing is used on a non-integer index. It should raise a `TypeError` instead of a `ValueError` to match the expected error message in the test case.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to raise a `TypeError` with the appropriate error message when integer indexing is used on a non-integer index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code now raises a `TypeError` with the appropriate error message when integer indexing is used on a non-integer index, matching the expected behavior in the test case.
