Potential error location:

The potential error occurs in the for loop where the function iterates over the axes of the object and checks the type of the elements in the key.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks the type of the elements in the key, and it does not handle the case where the key is a tuple.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Handle the case when the key is a tuple.
2. Use the isinstance() function to check the type of the elements in the key.


# Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        key = list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
