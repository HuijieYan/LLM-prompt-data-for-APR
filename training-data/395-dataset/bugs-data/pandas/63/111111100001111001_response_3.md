The buggy function `_convert_key` is designed to check if the keys are of the same type as the index in the `self.obj` attribute. The function iterates through the axes of the object and checks if the given key is compatible with the type of each axis. If not, it raises a ValueError.

The error occurs because the function doesn't handle the case where the key is a tuple of strings and the axes are of type 'Index' containing strings.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where the key is a tuple of strings. We should also validate that the length of the key matches the number of axes in the object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if len(key) != len(self.obj.axes):
        raise ValueError("Key length does not match number of axes")

    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, str):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code ensures that the length of the key matches the number of axes, and the type of each element in the key is validated against the type of the corresponding axis in the object.
