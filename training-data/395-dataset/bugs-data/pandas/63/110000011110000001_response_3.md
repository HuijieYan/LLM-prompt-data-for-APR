The test case `test_series_at_raises_type_error` is attempting to access the value of the series using `.at[0]`. The error message indicates that the issue occurs in the `_convert_key` method, specifically at the line `raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers")`. This suggests that the method is not handling non-integer indexers properly.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` method is not correctly differentiating between integer and non-integer indexers. This results in the method raising a `ValueError` when the indexer is non-integer.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` method to correctly identify the type of indexer and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we use `pd.api.types.is_integer(i)` to check if the indexer is an integer, and handle it accordingly. This should resolve the issue with non-integer indexers in the `_convert_key` method.
