Potential error location: 

The potential error location is within the if-else conditions that check the type of index and indexers.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the code is not correctly handling the type of index and indexers when using the `at` method compared to the `loc` method. This results in inconsistent error messages and behavior between the two methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Update the logic to handle the type of index and indexers consistently for both the `at` and `loc` methods.
2. Refactor the code to ensure that the error messages are aligned with the expected behavior for both methods.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (isinstance(ax, pd.RangeIndex) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code:
- I've used `isinstance` to check the type of index and indexers.
- Updated the error messages to be more clear and aligned with the expected behavior for both `at` and `loc` methods.
