The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` function where the error message is inconsistent between using `at` and `loc` methods to access a non-integer index. The error message for `at` method raises a `ValueError` while the error message for `loc` method raises a `TypeError`, which is inconsistent.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function is not handling non-integer indexes properly and is inconsistent between `at` and `loc` methods.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle non-integer indexes properly and ensure consistent error messages for both `at` and `loc` methods.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The changes include:
- Using `isinstance` instead of `is_integer` and `is_floating` to check the type of `i`.
- Raising a `TypeError` instead of `ValueError` for consistency with the error message raised by the `loc` method.

With these changes, the `_convert_key` function should handle non-integer indexes properly and provide consistent error messages for both `at` and `loc` methods.
