The `test_series_at_raises_type_error` function from the test case attempts to access the "0" index of a Series using both the `at` and `loc` methods. As per the expected behavior, both `at` and `loc` methods should raise the same error, but they don't. The error message for the `at` method states "ValueError: At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers," while the error message for the `loc` method states "TypeError: cannot do label indexing on <class 'pandas.core.indexes.base.Index'> with these indexers [0] of <class 'int'>."

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_convert_key` method, where it seems to be incorrectly checking for integer and non-integer indexers.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_convert_key` method does not handle the conversion of key values correctly based on the index type.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` method to correctly handle the conversion of key values based on the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, Index):
            if not ax.equals(i):
                raise ValueError(f"At based indexing on an {type(ax).__name__} index can only have {type(ax).__name__} indexers")
        elif isinstance(ax, RangeIndex):
            if not np.isscalar(i):
                raise ValueError(f"At based indexing on an {type(ax).__name__} index can only have scalar indexers")

    return key
```

The modified code checks the type of the index and based on that, it compares the key values. It raises a ValueError with the appropriate message if the types do not match. This change ensures that the error messages between `at` and `loc` methods are consistent.
