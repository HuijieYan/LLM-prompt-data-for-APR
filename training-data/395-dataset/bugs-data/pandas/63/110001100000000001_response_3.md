The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the key with the index to ensure they are of the same type.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to compare the key to the index without properly handling different types. This can lead to a ValueError being raised even when the key and index are of the same type, but the function doesn't recognize it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle comparisons of the key and the index when they are of different types.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, str) and not isinstance(ax, pd.core.indexes.category.CategoricalIndex):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-categorical index can only have non-categorical "
                "indexers"
            )
        elif isinstance(i, (int, float)) and not isinstance(ax, (pd.core.indexes.numeric.Int64Index, pd.core.indexes.numeric.Float64Index)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer or float index can only have integer or float indexers"
            )
        elif type(i) != type(ax):
            raise ValueError(
                "Keys should be of the same type as the index"
            )
    return key
```
