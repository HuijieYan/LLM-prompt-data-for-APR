The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the section where it checks for the type of the indexers and raises a `ValueError` if they do not match the type of the axis.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle non-integer indexers correctly when the axis is also non-integer. The check `if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating())` is incorrect as it always returns `False` for non-integer values of `i`. 

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle non-integer indexers when the axis is also non-integer.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't fallback).
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index "
                    "can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
