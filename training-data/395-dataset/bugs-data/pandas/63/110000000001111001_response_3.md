The potential error is located within the if-else statements in the for loop of the _convert_key function.

The error occurs because the function is trying to call methods is_integer(), holds_integer(), and is_floating() on the variable 'ax', which is of type 'Index'. The 'Index' class does not have these methods, which leads to the AttributeError when trying to call these methods.

To fix the bug, we can replace these method calls with appropriate checks on the types of the elements in the 'key' tuple.

Below is the corrected code for the _convert_key function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int):
            if not isinstance(ax, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, (float, str)) and not isinstance(ax, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
