The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly handling the conversion of the key for 'at' based indexing. The error messages for 'at' and 'loc' based indexing should ideally be consistent for the same input, but in this case, they are not.

The function `_convert_key` is used to convert the key for 'at' based indexing. The issue seems to be with the validation of the key against the index. The error messages indicate that there is a problem with handling non-integer indexes with non-integer indexers and vice versa.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly validating the key against the index. This is causing inconsistent behavior between 'at' and 'loc' based indexing.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly validate the key against the index for 'at' based indexing. It should ensure that the type of the key matches the type of the index, similar to how the 'loc' based indexing works.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        if not (ax.is_integer() or ax.is_floating()) and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function should properly validate the key against the index for 'at' based indexing and ensure consistent behavior with 'loc' based indexing for the same input. This should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report as well.
