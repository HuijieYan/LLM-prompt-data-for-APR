The error occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class defined in the file `indexing.py`. The method is intended to handle setting/getting keys for indexing operations, and ensure that keys are of the same type as the index.

Looking at the error message from the test function, the specific issue occurs when the `ser.at[0]` is invoked. This triggers a ValueError raised from the `_convert_key` method, indicating that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers".

The bug arises due to the incorrect logic in the `_convert_key` method related to handling non-integer indexers.

To fix the bug:
1. Correct the condition for non-integer indexers to allow integer values only if the axis is not floating or not holding integer values.
2. Simplify the logic to check the type of indexers and appropriately raise errors if the conditions are not met.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if is_integer(i):
            if ax.is_integer():
                continue
            elif ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
            else:
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an index with unsupported type"
                )
        else:
            if ax.is_integer():
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )

    return key
```

With these changes, the method will correctly handle integer and non-integer indexers and raise appropriate errors if the conditions are not met.
