The issue occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. This method is used to convert the input key to a format suitable for indexing. The bug arises from the inconsistency in error messages between the `loc` and `at` functions.

The expected behavior is that `at` and `loc` should behave consistently. However, the error messages show different behaviors for the two methods.

To fix this bug, the `_convert_key` method needs to be modified to ensure that both `at` and `loc` methods provide consistent error messages when dealing with non-integer indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the error messages for the `at` and `loc` methods should now behave consistently for non-integer indexes, addressing the bug reported.
