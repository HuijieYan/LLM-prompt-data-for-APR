Potential Error Location: The error may be occurring in the for loop where the function is checking if the index is of integer type.

Reason for the Bug: The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the methods like is_integer(), is_floating(), and holds_integer(). It seems that these methods are not defined or used incorrectly in this context.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check if the methods is_integer(), is_floating(), and holds_integer() are correctly defined and used in the context of the code.
2. If these methods are not part of the pandas library or are used incorrectly, consider using other methods available within the pandas library to validate index and key types.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(ax, pd.Int64Index) or isinstance(ax, pd.Float64Index):
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index or float index "
                    "can only have integer or float indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer or non-float "
                    "index can only have non-integer or non-float "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
