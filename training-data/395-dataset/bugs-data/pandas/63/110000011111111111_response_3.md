The error occurs when trying to access a value in a Series using the `at` method with an integer index. The buggy function `_convert_key` is responsible for this error.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking the type of the index against the type of the key without considering the specific case of using `at` to access an element by its index.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `_convert_key` function to handle the special case when `is_setter` is `False` in the context of using `at` to access elements by index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    ax = self.obj.axes[0]
    i = key[0]
    
    if ax.is_integer():
        if not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
    else:
        if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                "index can only have non-integer "
                "indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected function properly handles the case when accessing elements by index using the `at` method without raising unnecessary exceptions.
