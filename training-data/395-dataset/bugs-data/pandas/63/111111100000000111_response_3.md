The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function, which is used to convert the keys used for indexing in the `at` and `loc` methods. The error messages are inconsistent between `at` and `loc`, which is causing confusion for users.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for checking the type of indexes and keys. The function is not handling the conversion of keys properly, leading to inconsistencies in error messages between `at` and `loc`.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function is not handling the conversion of keys consistently for `at` and `loc`. This inconsistency in handling indexers is causing the inconsistent error messages.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the logic for checking the type of indexes and keys is consistent for both `at` and `loc`. Additionally, proper error messages should be raised in a consistent manner for both methods.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key`:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not pd.api.types.is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, I've made sure to use `pd.api.types.is_integer` to check the type of the indexers, and I've adjusted the error messages to ensure consistency between `at` and `loc`.
