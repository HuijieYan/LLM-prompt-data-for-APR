Issue analysis:

The error message "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" indicates that there is a type mismatch in the index and the key passed to the `_convert_key` function.

Error location:

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is in the loop where it checks the type of the index and the key. 

Reasons behind the bug:

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function is not handling the key and index types correctly. It is not comparing the types of the index and the key properly, leading to inconsistent behavior between `at` and `loc`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check the type of the index and key against each other properly.
2. Compare the types of the index and key to ensure consistency between `at` and `loc`.
3. Consider the specific behavior of `at` and `loc` and adjust the key and index types accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code includes proper type checking for the index and key, ensuring consistency between `at` and `loc` behavior.
