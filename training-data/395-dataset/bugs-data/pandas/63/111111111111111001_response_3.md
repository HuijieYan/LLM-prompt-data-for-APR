This is a bug in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class in the `pandas/core/indexing.py` file. The method is used to convert the key used for indexing.

Based on the test case, when a Series object is indexed using `ser.at[0]`, a `ValueError` should be raised. However, the actual error message indicates that a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers. This suggests that the logic for distinguishing integer and non-integer indexers within the `_convert_key` method is incorrectly implemented.

The bug occurs because the method is not correctly checking the type or nature of the index and the key values.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the type of the index and key value.
2. If the index is numeric, ensure that the key is also numeric (integer or floating point).
3. If the index is non-numeric, ensure that the key is also non-numeric (e.g., strings).

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_numeric():
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a numeric index can only have numeric indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, str):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-numeric index can only have non-numeric indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With these changes, the method now correctly checks the type and nature of the index and the key value, ensuring that they match appropriately.
