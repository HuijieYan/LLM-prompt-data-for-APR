The bug in this code appears to be that the function is improperly checking if the index is an integer and is not handling the case of a non-integer index appropriately.

The function `_convert_key` is designed to require the keys to be the same type as the index. It then checks if the index is an integer, but the check is flawed. It also appears to be converting the input `key` into a list unnecessarily when `is_setter` is True.

To fix this issue, we need to properly check if the index is an integer and handle the case of a non-integer index appropriately. We should also handle the conversion of `key` into a list separately from the index type checking logic when `is_setter` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    if not is_setter:
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if not ax.equals(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing requires the keys to be the same type as the index"
                )
    
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    else:
        return key
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `is_setter` is False, then we iterate through the axes of the index and compare each axis with the corresponding key. If they are not equal, we raise a ValueError. If `is_setter` is True, we directly return the `key` as a list.

This should fix the issues with the original function and handle the cases of non-integer indices appropriately.
