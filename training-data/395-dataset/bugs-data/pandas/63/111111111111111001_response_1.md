The error occurs at the `_convert_key` function, specifically at the block where it checks whether the index value is an integer or not. It raises a ValueError if the index is expected to be non-integer but an integer is encountered.

The bug occurs because the `_convert_key` function does not handle the case when the key is out of range. When accessing an element using `.at`, it requires that the provided index should exist within the index of the Series. If an index that does not exist in the Series is provided, it raises a ValueError when handling this case.

To fix this bug, we need to add an additional check in the `_convert_key` function to ensure that the provided key exists within the index of the Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # Allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    # Check if the key exists in the index
    if key not in self.obj.index:
        raise KeyError(f"Index '{key}' is out of range for axis 0 with size {len(self.obj.index)}")
    
    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the `_convert_key` function will raise a KeyError with a specific error message when the provided index/key does not exist in the Series.
