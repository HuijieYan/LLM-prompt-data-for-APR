The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function in the `pandas.core.indexing.py` file. This function is responsible for converting the key to the same type as the index. The error message mentions that based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers. This indicates that the issue might be related to the data type of the index and the type of indexers being used. 

The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the conversion of keys and the type of index. It should be validating the type of the key in relation to the index type.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_convert_key` function to properly validate the type of the key in relation to the index type. We should also consider the type of indexers being used and ensure that they are compatible with the index type.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With these changes, the function should now properly validate the type of the key in relation to the index type, and ensure that the indexers are compatible with the index type. This should resolve the inconsistency in errors/msgs between `loc` and `at`.
