The buggy function checks the type of the index and the key values to ensure they match, raising a ValueError if they do not. However, based on the expected output and the error message, it seems the function is not correctly determining whether the index is of type integer or floating.

The bug seems to be located in the section that checks the type of index for Integer and Floating. The function is_integer() should be called from the object ax, and is_integer() method should be called afterwards.

We should update the function to correctly determine whether the index is of type integer or floating and then perform the type checking accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() or isinstance(i, int):
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        elif ax.is_floating() or isinstance(i, float):
            if not isinstance(i, float):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
