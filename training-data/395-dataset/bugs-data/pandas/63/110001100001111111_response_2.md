The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class, which is used for converting the key type for indexing. The error messages suggest that there is inconsistency between the behavior of `at` and `loc` methods when indexing with non-integer keys.

The bug appears to be in the logic that checks the type of the index and the type of the key for at-based indexing. The current implementation is not correctly handling non-integer index keys, leading to inconsistent error messages.

To fix the bug:
1. The function should correctly handle non-integer index keys for at-based indexing.
2. The function should also ensure that the behavior is consistent between `at` and `loc` methods when indexing with non-integer keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index.
    """
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int):
                raise TypeError(
                    f"cannot do label indexing on {type(ax)} "
                    f"with these indexers [{i}] of {type(i)}"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles non-integer index keys for at-based indexing and ensures consistent behavior between `at` and `loc` methods.
