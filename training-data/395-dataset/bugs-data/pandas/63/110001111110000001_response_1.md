The test case `test_series_at_raises_type_error` is attempting to use the `at` indexer to access an element in the `Series` using an integer index (0), and is expecting it to raise a TypeError. The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is raised instead, which is unexpected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional checks for whether `i` is an integer or not. This is likely causing the function to raise a `ValueError` when the test case is expecting a `TypeError`.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking for integer types in the key, which results in the wrong type of error being raised. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the expected behavior of the function.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the conditional checks to correctly handle the cases where integer indexes are used. By checking the type of the index and handling integer indexes appropriately, the function can be made to raise the correct `TypeError` when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
            raise TypeError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and ax.is_integer():
            raise TypeError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```
