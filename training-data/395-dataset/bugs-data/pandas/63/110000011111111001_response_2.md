The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function. The error message indicates that the issue lies in the portion of the code where it checks if the index is an integer and the key is non-integer. This triggers a ValueError.

The bug is likely occurring because the code is incorrectly handling comparisons between the index and the key in terms of integer and non-integer types.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle comparisons between the index and the key, ensuring that the appropriate type checks are performed.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fall back)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        # Check if the index is an integer type
        if ax.is_integer():
            # Ensure that the key is also an integer
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            # If the index is non-integer, ensure that the key is also non-integer
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```
In this corrected function, the index type and key type are appropriately handled, and the ValueError conditions are checked to ensure that they are both aligned with the expected types.
