Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function is at the condition `if is_integer(i)` and `ax.holds_integer()`. The function `is_integer()` is not a valid function in Python, it should be replaced with `isinstance(i, int)` to check if the variable `i` is an instance of the `int` class.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurred due to the incorrect usage of the `is_integer()` function, which is not a valid function in Python. This caused a syntax error and would not allow the code to run successfully.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Replace the usage of `is_integer(i)` with `isinstance(i, int)` to properly check if the variable `i` is an instance of the `int` class.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
