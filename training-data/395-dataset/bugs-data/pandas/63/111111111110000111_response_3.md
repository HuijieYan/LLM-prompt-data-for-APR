1. The test case is trying to use the `at` method to access an element in a Series object using a non-integer key. The expected behavior is to raise a `TypeError` with a specific message. However, the actual behavior is raising a `ValueError` with a different message.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop where it checks whether the index is an integer or not.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the non-integer key properly and is raising a `ValueError` instead of a `TypeError`.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the function to check for the type of the key and raise a `TypeError` when it doesn't match the index type.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

The corrected code now raises a `TypeError` instead of a `ValueError` when the key type does not match the index type. This aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the inconsistency between `at` and `loc` methods.
