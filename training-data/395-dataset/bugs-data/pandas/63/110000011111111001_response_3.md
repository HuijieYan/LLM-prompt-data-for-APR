The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method. The error occurs because the method is not handling the case where the index is a non-integer index and the indexer is an integer.

To fix this bug, the method needs to be modified to handle both cases (integer and non-integer indexes) correctly.

Here's the correction for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if isinstance(i, int) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

With this correction, the function should be able to handle both cases of integer and non-integer indexes correctly and the error message should no longer occur.
