The bug is occurring in the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. This function is used to validate keys for indexing and is currently raising a `ValueError` if an index is non-integer and an integer key is used.

The test case is attempting to access an integer index using both `at` and `loc`. The error message for `loc` is a `TypeError`, while the error message for `at` is a `ValueError`. The issue is that these two methods should behave in a consistent manner, so they should both produce similar error messages when faced with the same situation.

To fix this bug, the approach is to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle both integer and non-integer indexes in a consistent manner. One possible approach is to remove the type-specific error checking and replace it with a more general validation that ensures the key is compatible with the index.

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)
    
    if not all(k in self.obj.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError("One or more keys are not present in the index")
    
    return key
```

This approach simplifies the key validation process and ensures consistent behavior between `at` and `loc`. It checks if all keys are present in the index, and if not, it raises a `KeyError`. Otherwise, it returns the key, allowing the indexing operation to proceed.
