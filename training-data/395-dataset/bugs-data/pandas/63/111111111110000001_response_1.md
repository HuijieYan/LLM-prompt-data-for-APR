The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the conditional checks where it is trying to determine if the index is an integer or not. The error message indicates that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers" is being raised, which suggests that there is an issue with the logic that determines whether the index is an integer or non-integer.

The potential source of the bug is in the conditional checks for `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods. It seems that the logic is incorrect or incomplete, leading to the incorrect error being raised.

To fix this bug, the conditional checks for whether the index is an integer or non-integer need to be revised. Additionally, the logic for determining the type of indexers should be reviewed and updated to correctly handle the situation where the index is non-integer.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_integer():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
        elif not isinstance(i, int) and not ax.is_float():
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

In the corrected code, we are checking whether the indexer `i` is an instance of `int` or `float` as opposed to using the `is_integer()` and `holds_integer()` methods. This approach ensures that we correctly handle the situation where the index is non-integer and raise the appropriate error if needed.
