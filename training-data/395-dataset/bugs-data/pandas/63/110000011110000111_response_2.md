The error occurs in the `_convert_key` function, specifically in the part where it checks for the type of the index before returning the key. The function does not handle the case where the index is a non-integer, leading to inconsistent error messages when using `.at` and `.loc` for label indexing.

The bug occurs because the function fails to appropriately handle non-integer indexes. The function checks if the index is an integer, but it doesn't account for non-integer indexes, resulting in the inconsistent error messages observed in the test case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add an additional condition to check for non-integer indexes and handle them accordingly. This will ensure consistency in error messages when using `.at` and `.loc` for label indexing.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In the corrected `_convert_key` function, the condition for checking non-integer indexes has been added within the `else` block. This ensures that non-integer indexes are appropriately handled and consistent error messages are generated when using `.at` and `.loc` for label indexing.
