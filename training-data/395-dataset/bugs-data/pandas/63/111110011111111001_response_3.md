The error message indicates that when calling the `ser.at[0]` method, a `ValueError` is raised within the `_convert_key` function of the `_AtIndexer` class. The specific error message states: "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` function is identified as the conditional block that checks for the type of index and key. The issue seems to arise from the comparison between the key and the index.

The reason behind this bug might be that the comparison logic for the key and index types is incorrect, leading to the incorrect raising of a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic should be adjusted to accurately determine whether the key and index types are compatible. This could involve using different type-checking methods or revising the conditional statements in the `_convert_key` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, (float, int)):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This corrected code adds type checking based on the index types, ensuring that integer indexes can only have integer indexers and non-integer indexes can only have non-integer indexers.
