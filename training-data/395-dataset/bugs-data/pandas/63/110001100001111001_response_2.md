The bug occurs in the for loop where the function iterates through the axes of the object. It checks if the index is an integer, and if so, it should only accept integer indexers. Otherwise, it should only accept non-integer indexers. However, the current code is not properly checking for these conditions.

To fix the bug, we can update the code to properly check the conditions and raise the ValueError with the appropriate error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require keys to be the same type as the index, so we don't fallback
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not isinstance(i, int):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if not isinstance(i, (int, float)):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This fixes the conditions for checking integer and non-integer indexers and raises the appropriate ValueError with the correct error message.
