The bug is causing inconsistent error messages between the `at` and `loc` methods in the pandas DataFrame. The specific issue is with the `_convert_key` function in the `@AtIndexer` class. The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking for integer types when converting keys.

The potential error location is in the conditional statements within the for loop that checks the index type.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not properly handling integer and non-integer index types when converting keys. This leads to inconsistent error messages when using the `at` and `loc` methods on the DataFrame.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statements within the for loop to properly check for integer and non-integer index types and raise consistent error messages for both cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif not ax.is_integer() and isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )

    return key
```

This corrected code properly checks for integer and non-integer index types and raises consistent error messages for both cases, ensuring that the `at` and `loc` methods behave the same way.
