The bug occurs in the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas.core.indexing` module. The method is intended to handle label indexing and requires the keys to be the same type as the index. The bug causes a `ValueError` to be raised when performing label indexing on an integer index with non-integer indexers.

The bug is likely occurring due to the check for integer and non-integer indexers not working as intended. This results in the method incorrectly identifying the type of indexers, leading to the incorrect `ValueError` being raised.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and comparisons for integer and non-integer indexers within the `_convert_key` method need to be revised. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the type of indexers and their compatibility with the corresponding index more carefully.

Here's the corrected version of the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not isinstance(i, int):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index "
                "can only have integer indexers"
            )
        else:
            if not ax.is_integer() and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on a non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```

In this corrected version, the `is_integer()` method is used to check if the index is an integer index, and `isinstance(i, int)` is used to verify if the indexer is of type `int`.

This should address the bug related to the incorrect error being raised during label indexing, and the `_convert_key` method should now behave as expected.
