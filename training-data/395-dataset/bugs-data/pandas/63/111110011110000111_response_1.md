The test case is attempting to use the `at` and `loc` methods on a Series, with the intention of understanding how these methods behave differently. The error message indicates that the method `at` raised a `ValueError`, while the method `loc` raised a `TypeError`. The GitHub issue title and description suggest that the behavior of these two methods is inconsistent, which is the root cause of the bug.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` method is at the point where it raises a `ValueError` for non-integer indexes. This behavior is causing a `ValueError` to be raised when using the `at` method, leading to an inconsistent error message compared to the `loc` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is an inconsistent handling of index types between the `at` and `loc` methods. This inconsistency results in different error messages being raised for similar scenarios, leading to confusion for users.

To fix the bug, the `_convert_key` method should be modified to handle non-integer indexes consistently between the `at` and `loc` methods. This can be achieved by adjusting the conditions and error handling within the method to ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected behavior for both methods.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` method is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on an integer index can only have integer indexers"
            )
        elif (not ax.is_integer() and not ax.holds_integer() and not ax.is_floating()) and is_integer(i):
            raise ValueError(
                "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
            )
    return key
```

This modification ensures that the `at` and `loc` methods behave consistently when handling different types of indexes, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
