The bug in the function `_convert_key` is that it does not handle the case where the key is a single-element tuple correctly. The function is expecting the key to be a list, but it is receiving a tuple, causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle both tuple and list input for the `key` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` function:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key) if isinstance(key, (tuple,)) else key
    else:
        for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
            if ax.is_integer():
                if not is_integer(i):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an integer index "
                        "can only have integer indexers"
                    )
            else:
                if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                    raise ValueError(
                        "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                        "index can only have non-integer "
                        "indexers"
                    )
    return list(key) if isinstance(key, (tuple,)) else key
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle both tuple and list inputs for the `key` parameter, ensuring that it does not fail when receiving a tuple.
