The error message suggests that there is a ValueError raised in the `_convert_key` method of the `_AtIndexer` class. The error occurs when attempting to do label indexing on an integer index with integer indexers. This indicates that the `_convert_key` method is not handling the conversion of keys properly.

The bug seems to be related to the check for integer types in the keys and the axes. The code is checking whether the axis is an integer and then checking if the key is an integer, which is causing the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the code should check if the axis is a non-integer type and then ensure that the key is also a non-integer type. If the axis is an integer type, then the key should also be an integer.

Here is the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index (so we don't
    fallback).
    """
    if not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        key = [key]

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if (ax.is_integer() and not is_integer(i)) or (ax.is_floating() and not isinstance(i, float)):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on an integer/floating index can only have integer/floating indexers")
        elif (not ax.is_integer() and not ax.is_floating()) and not isinstance(i, str):
            raise ValueError("At based indexing on a non-integer/non-float index can only have non-integer/non-float indexers")
    return key
```

The corrected code provides a more robust key type validation based on the type of the index, handling both integer and non-integer index types appropriately.
