Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the loop where the function checks the type of index and the type of key elements to ensure they match.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the case where the key is a scalar value, causing inconsistencies between the behavior of `at` and `loc` methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the key is a scalar value. If so, convert it to a list with just one element.
2. Implement the handling of scalar values in the loop to ensure consistent behavior between `at` and `loc`.

Corrected code:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # check if key is a scalar value
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = [key]

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an integer index "
                    "can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At based indexing on an non-integer "
                    "index can only have non-integer "
                    "indexers"
                )
    return key
```
This corrected code checks for scalar keys and converts them to a list with a single element before entering the loop to ensure consistent behavior between `at` and `loc` methods.
