The test case is trying to access the element at index "a" using both the `at` and `loc` methods. The code is expecting the result to be 1 in both cases. 

The error occurs when the test case attempts to access the element at index 0 using the `at` method, resulting in a `ValueError`. This is inconsistent with the behavior of the `loc` method, which raises a `TypeError`. The inconsistency between the errors from `at` and `loc` methods is the reason for this bug.

To fix this bug, the error handling logic in the `_convert_key` function needs to be updated so that the error raised by the `at` method matches the error raised by the `loc` method in the test case. This can be achieved by aligning the error types and messages for both methods.

The corrected code for the `_convert_key` function is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise TypeError(  # Change from ValueError to TypeError
                    "cannot do label indexing on <class 'pandas.core.indexes.base.Index'> "
                    f"with these indexers [{i}] of <class '{type(i).__name__}'>"  # Update message to include the indexer value and its type
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) and not (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise TypeError(  # Change from ValueError to TypeError
                    "cannot do label indexing on <class 'pandas.core.indexes.base.Index'> "
                    f"with these indexers [{i}] of <class '{type(i).__name__}'>"  # Update message to include the indexer value and its type
                )
    return key
```

By making these changes, the error raised by the `at` method will match the error raised by the `loc` method in the test case, resolving the inconsistency and fixing the bug.
