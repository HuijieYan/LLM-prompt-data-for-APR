The error message is indicating that there is a ValueError being raised within the `_convert_key` method of the `pandas.core.indexing` module. Specifically, the error is stating that "At based indexing on a non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers."

Upon inspecting the test function, it seems that the issue arises when trying to use the `ser.at[0]` syntax, which is meant to do label-based indexing. This suggests that the bug is likely related to the handling of non-integer keys or labels in the `_convert_key` method.

The potential error location within the `_convert_key` method is the section where it checks if the axis holds an integer value and if the key is an integer.

One approach to fixing this bug is to modify the logic in the `_convert_key` method to correctly handle the scenario where the axis holds non-integer values and the key is an integer. This may involve handling non-integer keys differently when the axis does not hold integer or floating point values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_key` method:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require they keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if not ax.is_type_compatible(i):
            raise ValueError(
                f"At based indexing on {ax.dtype} index can only have {ax.dtype} indexers"
            )

    return key
```

In this corrected code, the `_convert_key` method now checks if the key is compatible with the type of the axis, and if not, it raises a ValueError with a descriptive error message. This ensures that the indexing operation is performed correctly based on the type of the axis and the type of the indexers being used.
