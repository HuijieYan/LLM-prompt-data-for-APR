Upon analyzing the test case and its relationship with the error message, the issue seems to be related to inconsistency between the errors/messages generated by `df.at[0]` and `df.loc[0]`. The error from `df.at[0]` is a `ValueError` related to non-integer indexing, while the error from `df.loc[0]` is a `TypeError` related to label indexing.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the logic for handling non-integer indexing.

The bug occurred due to inconsistent handling of errors and messages between `loc` and `at` methods. In the provided buggy function `_convert_key`, there is an inconsistency in the error messages being raised when the index is non-integer and is being accessed using `at` and `loc`. The messages should be synchronized to provide consistent error handling.

To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the `_convert_key` function to handle the non-integer indexing consistently for both `at` and `loc` methods. The logic should be adjusted to raise the same type of error based on the type of index and indexer being used.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_convert_key` is as follows:

```python
def _convert_key(self, key, is_setter: bool = False):
    """
    Require the keys to be the same type as the index. (so we don't
    fallback)
    """
    # allow arbitrary setting
    if is_setter:
        return list(key)

    for ax, i in zip(self.obj.axes, key):
        if ax.is_integer():
            if not is_integer(i):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based or label-based indexing with integer index can only have integer indexers"
                )
        else:
            if is_integer(i) or (ax.holds_integer() or ax.is_floating()):
                raise ValueError(
                    "At-based or label-based indexing with non-integer index can only have non-integer indexers"
                )
    return key
```

This corrected code ensures consistent error handling and messages for both `at` and `loc` methods when dealing with non-integer indexing.
