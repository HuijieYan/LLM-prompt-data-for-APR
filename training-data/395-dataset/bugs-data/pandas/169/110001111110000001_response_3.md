The test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is creating a DataFrame with a single column of datetime values, and then calling the `quantile` method with `0.5`. This is expected to calculate the median value of the datetime values in the DataFrame.

The error message indicates that there is an issue when trying to concatenate arrays. This is likely occurring in the `quantile` method, where the code attempts to concatenate arrays to calculate the quantile, resulting in a `ValueError` due to an empty array being passed to `np.concatenate`.

The bug in the `quantile` method is likely due to the code not handling the case of an empty DataFrame correctly when calculating the quantile.

To fix the bug, the `quantile` method should include a check for an empty DataFrame and return an empty Series or DataFrame, as appropriate, instead of trying to perform calculations on an empty dataset.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    if self.empty:
        if np.isscalar(q):
            return pd.Series(name=q)
        else:
            return pd.DataFrame(index=q, columns=self.columns)

    # ...rest of the function remains unchanged...
```
