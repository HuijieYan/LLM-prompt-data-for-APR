The test case calls the `quantile` method on a DataFrame created from a date range. The error occurs when trying to concatenate empty arrays, which is likely due to incorrect handling of empty DataFrames within the `quantile` method.

The potential error location within the `quantile` method is the part where it attempts to concatenate and process the quantiles.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code doesn't handle empty DataFrames properly, leading to the attempt to concatenate empty arrays and resulting in a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we should add a check at the beginning of the `quantile` method to handle empty DataFrames, and return an empty DataFrame or Series accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    # ... (other parts of the method remain unchanged)

    if self.empty:
        if isinstance(q, (float, int)):
            return pd.Series([], name=q)
        elif isinstance(q, list):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=self.columns)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```
