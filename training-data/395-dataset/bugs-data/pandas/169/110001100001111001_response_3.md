Issue:
The buggy function is called with an input "self" of type DataFrame, but inside the function implementation, it tries to access the attribute "_data", which suggests that it is expecting a different type of object. This inconsistency in the expected input and the code implementation leads to the error.

Potential error location:
The erroneous part seems to be related to the following statement:
```python
result = data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)
```

Reason behind the bug:
The issue arises because the function is expecting a specific type of object ('q', 'axis', 'interpolation', 'is_transposed') based on the implementation, but the input 'data' is of a different type (DataFrame).

Approach to fixing the bug:
The function should handle the 'data' object correctly based on its type (e.g., DataFrame). The quantile calculation logic should be adapted to operate on DataFrame data appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self.select_dtypes('number') if numeric_only else self
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```
