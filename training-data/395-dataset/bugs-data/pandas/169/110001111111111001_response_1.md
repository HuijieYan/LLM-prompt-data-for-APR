The error seems to be related to the `data._data.quantile` method call where it attempts to concatenate arrays, but it receives an empty list. This suggests that the `data` object might not be appropriately populated with the required data.

The bug seems to stem from the misuse of the `self._constructor` method and the resulting creation of the `result`. Additionally, the process of transposing the data using `data.T` and subsequently recalculating `result` based on the transposed data also seems to be erroneous.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made:
1. Ensure that `data` is appropriately populated with the required data for quantile calculation.
2. Check the flow of the function to understand if transposing is necessary, and based on that, re-calculate the result.

Here is the corrected code for the `quantile` function:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)

    if axis == 1:  # If the axis is transposed
        data = data.T
        names = data.index
    else:
        names = data.columns

    result = data._data.quantile(q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=(axis == 1))

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result, index=names)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q, index=names)

    if axis == 1:
        result = result.T

    return result
```
