The test case is calling the quantile method on a DataFrame containing a date range with no columns. The error message indicates a ValueError when trying to concatenate arrays, which suggests that the quantile function is trying to concatenate empty arrays, likely as a result of processing the empty DataFrame.

The potential error location within the quantile function is the handling of an empty DataFrame, which is not being properly considered.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case of an empty DataFrame when trying to calculate the quantile.

One approach to fixing the bug is to add a specific check at the beginning of the function to handle the case of an empty DataFrame, returning empty Series or DataFrame as appropriate.

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (omitted code) ...

    """
    if self.empty:
        if isinstance(q, list):
            return pd.DataFrame([], index=q, columns=self.columns)
        else:
            return pd.Series([], name=q, index=self.columns)
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    ... (remaining code stays the same) ...
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the DataFrame is empty using the `self.empty` attribute. If it is empty, we return an empty DataFrame if `q` is a list, and an empty Series if `q` is a float. This will handle the case of an empty DataFrame and prevent the ValueError from occurring.
