The error in the `quantile` function is likely caused by the `_check_percentile` method call, which should be a method of the DataFrame or NDFrame object, but instead appears to be an unformatted string, possibly due to a copy-paste error. This leads to an error where the method named like a string is not found.

To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the `_check_percentile` is a valid method defined for the DataFrame or NDFrame class.
2. Make sure that the methods or attributes being used within the `quantile` function are properly defined and accessible from the `DataFrame` or `NDFrame` class.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
        # Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.
        data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
        axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
        is_transposed = axis == 1
        if is_transposed:
            data = data.T
        result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation)
        return result
```
