The issue seems to be related to the way the `quantile` function is handling date time data in a DataFrame. The error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate" suggests that there might be an issue with concatenating the data in the `quantile` function.

One potential error location within the function is where the `data._data.quantile` operation is being performed.

The reason for this bug is that when the `quantile` function is called on a DataFrame containing datetime data, it tries to concatenate the data in a way that is not applicable to datetime data, which leads to the ValueError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the datetime data differently in the `quantile` function, so that it can be processed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` function that handles datetime data correctly:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)

    if not numeric_only:
        data = self
    else:
        data = self._get_numeric_data()

    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T
        result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation), axis=1).T
    else:
        result = data.apply(lambda x: x.quantile(q, interpolation=interpolation), axis=0)

    return result
```

This corrected function uses the `apply` method to calculate the quantile for each column (or row if transposed) in the DataFrame, taking into account datetime data. This way, the datetime data is handled correctly and the function should return the expected output.
