The test case `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` creates a DataFrame with datetime values and attempts to calculate the quantile using the `quantile` method. This test case is related to the error message which states that there is a `ValueError` when attempting to concatenate arrays.

The potential error location within the `quantile` method is the concatenation of arrays, which is likely causing the `ValueError` mentioned in the error message.

The bug occurs because the code is not handling datetime values correctly during the quantile calculation. The method needs to be modified to handle datetime values appropriately.

To fix the bug, modification is needed in the `_constructor` and `quantile` methods in order to handle datetime values correctly. Specifically, the result needs to be converted to a Series with datetime values when datetime values are present.

Here's the corrected code for the `quantile` method:
```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    ...
    if is_transposed:
        result = self._constructor(result._data._first_block)
        result = result.T
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)
    return result
```
The modification involves making use of the `_constructor` method with the first block of data if the DataFrame contains datetime values.

This change ensures that the `quantile` method correctly handles datetime and non-datetime data, and the concatenation for quantile calculation is performed without raising any errors.
