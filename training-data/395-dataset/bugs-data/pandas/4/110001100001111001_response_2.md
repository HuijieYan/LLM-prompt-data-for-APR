The bug occurs in the `_join_multi` function due to several issues. 

1. The function is calling methods such as `droplevel` and `reorder_levels` without the `self` parameter, which is required for these methods to work properly.
2. The function is using `com.not_none` which is not a standard method, and it's unclear what its purpose is.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the `self` parameter to the `droplevel` and `reorder_levels` methods. We also need to remove the usage of `com.not_none`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
        from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
        from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    
        # figure out join names
        self_names = set(self.names)
        other_names = set(other.names)
        overlap = self_names & other_names
    
        # need at least 1 in common
        if not overlap:
            raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")
    
        self_is_mi = isinstance(self, MultiIndex)
        other_is_mi = isinstance(other, MultiIndex)
    
        if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
    
            # Drop the non-matching levels from left and right respectively
            ldrop_names = list(self_names - overlap)
            rdrop_names = list(other_names - overlap)
    
            # if only the order differs
            if not len(ldrop_names + rdrop_names):
                self_jnlevels = self
                other_jnlevels = other.reorder_levels(self.names)
            else:
                self_jnlevels = self.droplevel(ldrop_names)
                other_jnlevels = other.droplevel(rdrop_names)
    
            # Join left and right
            # Join on same leveled multi-index frames is supported
            join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(
                other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True
            )
    
            # Restore the dropped levels
            # Returned index level order is
            # common levels, ldrop_names, rdrop_names
            dropped_names = ldrop_names + rdrop_names
    
            levels, codes, names = _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin(
                self, other, dropped_names, join_idx, lidx, ridx
            )
    
            # Re-create the multi-index
            multi_join_idx = MultiIndex(
                levels=levels, codes=codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False
            )
    
            multi_join_idx = multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()
    
            return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx
    
        jl = list(overlap)[0]
    
        # Case where only one index is multi
        # make the indices into mi's that match
        flip_order = False
        if self_is_mi:
            self, other = other, self
            flip_order = True
            # flip if join method is right or left
            how = {"right": "left", "left": "right"}.get(how, how)
    
        level = other.names.index(jl)
        result = self._join_level(
            other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers
        )
    
        if flip_order:
            if isinstance(result, tuple):
                return result[0], result[2], result[1]
        return result
```
In the corrected code, we have added `self` parameter to the `droplevel()` and `reorder_levels()` methods and removed the usage of `com.not_none`. These changes should fix the bug in the `_join_multi` function.
