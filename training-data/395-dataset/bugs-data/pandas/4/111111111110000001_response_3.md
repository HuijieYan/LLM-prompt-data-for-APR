The error message indicates that the `join` function is returning a tuple instead of an Index, which is causing the assertion error in the test function.

The potential error location within the `_join_multi` function is when it's trying to return `multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx`. This indicates that the function is returning a tuple containing the multi-index and two additional values, instead of just the multi-index.

The reason behind this bug is that the `_join_multi` function is incorrectly returning a tuple with extra values, resulting in the test function encountering an unexpected return type.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_join_multi` function to return only the `multi_join_idx` multi-index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    # ... (omitted code)

    if flip_order:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            return result[0]
    return result
```

By modifying the function to return only `result[0]` when `flip_order` is true, we ensure that the function's return type is consistent and matches the expected output in the test case.
