The given buggy code is the implementation of the private method `_join_multi` in the file `pandas/core/indexes/base.py`. This method is responsible for joining two multi-indexes, dropping non-matching levels, joining them, restoring the dropped levels, and re-creating the multi-index. The bug seems to be related to the `return_indexers` parameter, which is not being used correctly in some cases.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug include:
1. The function does not properly utilize the `return_indexers` parameter, leading to the incorrect behavior.
2. In some cases, the `return_indexers` parameter is completely ignored, causing the function to always return the indexers.

To fix the bug, the function `_join_multi` should be modified to properly utilize the `return_indexers` parameter according to the given input. The corrected code for the function should ensure that the `return_indexers` parameter is used in the joining process as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=False):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    self_names = set(com.not_none(*self.names))
    other_names = set(com.not_none(*other.names))
    overlap = self_names & other_names

    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")

    self_is_mi = isinstance(self, ABCMultiIndex)
    other_is_mi = isinstance(other, ABCMultiIndex)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        ldrop_names = list(self_names - overlap)
        rdrop_names = list(other_names - overlap)

        if not len(ldrop_names + rdrop_names):
            self_jnlevels = self
            other_jnlevels = other.reorder_levels(self.names)
        else:
            self_jnlevels = self.droplevel(ldrop_names)
            other_jnlevels = other.droplevel(rdrop_names)

        join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(
            other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=return_indexers
        )

        # Other code remains the same
        # ...
```

In the corrected code, the `return_indexers` parameter is used in the `join` method based on the input value passed to the `_join_multi` function, allowing the function to behave as expected with respect to the `return_indexers` parameter.
