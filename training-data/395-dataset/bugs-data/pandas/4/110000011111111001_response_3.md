The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` uses the `join` method of a `MultiIndex` object and expects the returned result to be equal to the original `MultiIndex` object `midx1`. However, the error message indicates that the test fails because the expected type of the result is an `Index`, but a `tuple` is found instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the method `_join_multi` returns a result. It appears that the `join` operation within the `_join_multi` method is returning a tuple instead of the expected `MultiIndex` object.

The bug occurs because the function `_join_multi` is not returning the correct type of object. This is likely due to an incorrect return statement that returns a tuple instead of the expected `MultiIndex` object.

To fix the bug, the return statement in the `_join_multi` method should be modified to return the correct object type, which is the `MultiIndex` object `multi_join_idx`. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the return type of the function matches the expected return type of the test case.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_join_multi` is provided below:
```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    # existing code...

    # ...

    return multi_join_idx
```
