Potential Error: 
The potential error in the given function is that the `ABC` module is not imported, which might cause an error when checking if `self` and `other` are instances of `ABCMultiIndex`. Additionally, the code uses `com` which is not defined in this function.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the necessary module `ABC` is not imported, and `com` is not defined in the given function.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the necessary modules such as `ABC` and `com` for the function to work properly.
2. Check if the input parameters `self` and `other` are instances of `ABCMultiIndex` before proceeding with the operations.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    from pandas.core.arrays.multiarray import ABCMultiIndex
    import pandas.core.common as com

    # rest of the function is unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the necessary modules `ABCMultiIndex` and `com` are imported, which will allow the function to work properly.
