The error message is indicating that the `join` method is returning a tuple instead of a `Index` type, causing the assertion error. This suggests that the `join` method is not returning the expected result.

The potential error location within the `_join_multi` function is likely the line `join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True)` where the `join` method is returning a tuple instead of an `Index`. This is likely due to the logic within the `join` method.

The bug is occurring because the `join` method within the `_join_multi` function is not returning the expected result. This could be due to incorrect implementation or logic within the `join` method.

To fix this bug, the logic within the `join` method should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure it returns the correct type of result, which is an `Index` type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    self_names = set(com.not_none(*self.names))
    other_names = set(com.not_none(*other.names))
    overlap = self_names & other_names

    # need at least 1 in common
    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")

    self_is_mi = isinstance(self, ABCMultiIndex)
    other_is_mi = isinstance(other, ABCMultiIndex)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:

        # Drop the non-matching levels from left and right respectively
        ldrop_names = list(self_names - overlap)
        rdrop_names = list(other_names - overlap)

        # if only the order differs
        if not len(ldrop_names + rdrop_names):
            self_jnlevels = self
            other_jnlevels = other.reorder_levels(self.names)
        else:
            self_jnlevels = self.droplevel(ldrop_names)
            other_jnlevels = other.droplevel(rdrop_names)

        # Join left and right
        # Join on same leveled multi-index frames is supported
        join_result = self_jnlevels.join(other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True)
        join_idx = join_result[0]
        lidx = join_result[1]
        ridx = join_result[2]

        # Restore the dropped levels
        # Returned index level order is
        # common levels, ldrop_names, rdrop_names
        dropped_names = ldrop_names + rdrop_names

        levels, codes, names = _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin(
            self, other, dropped_names, join_idx, lidx, ridx
        )

        # Re-create the multi-index
        multi_join_idx = MultiIndex(
            levels=levels, codes=codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False
        )

        multi_join_idx = multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()

        return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx

    jl = list(overlap)[0]

    # Case where only one index is multi
    # make the indices into mi's that match
    flip_order = False
    if self_is_mi:
        self, other = other, self
        flip_order = True
        # flip if join method is right or left
        how = {"right": "left", "left": "right"}.get(how, how)

    level = other.names.index(jl)
    result = self._join_level(other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)
    if flip_order:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            return result[0], result[2], result[1]
    return result
