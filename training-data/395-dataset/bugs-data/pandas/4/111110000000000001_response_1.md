The potential error in the code is that the function _join_multi() is not fully implemented and might not work as intended when called. This can lead to errors when attempting to perform a join operation using this function.

The error occurs because the function _join_multi() is incomplete and lacks certain functionalities required for joining multi-level indices.

To fix the bug, the _join_multi() function should be completed and implemented to handle multi-level index joins properly.

Here's the corrected code for the _join_multi() function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how='left', return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _get_join_info
    
    join_index, left_indexer, right_indexer = _get_join_info(
        [self.values], [other.values], how=how, sort=False, level=0
    )
    
    if return_indexers:
        return join_index, left_indexer, right_indexer
    else:
        return join_index
```
