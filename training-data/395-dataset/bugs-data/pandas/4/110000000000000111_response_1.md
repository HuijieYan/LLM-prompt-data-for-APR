Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the handling of the `return_indexers` parameter in the `_join_multi` function. It appears that the `return_indexers` parameter is not being appropriately considered in the function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `return_indexers` parameter is being ignored in some cases when calling the `_join_multi` function, resulting in unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `return_indexers` parameter should be appropriately considered and handled in all cases within the `_join_multi` function. This may involve modifying the conditional statements and function calls to ensure that the parameter is used as expected.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    # ... (previous code)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        # ... (previous code)

        # Join left and right
        # Join on same leveled multi-index frames is supported
        if return_indexers:
            join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(
                other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True
            )
        else:
            join_idx = self_jnlevels.join(other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=False)
            lidx, ridx = None, None

        # ... (previous code)

        return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx

    jl = list(overlap)[0]

    # ... (previous code)
    result = self._join_level(
        other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers
    )

    if not return_indexers:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            result = result[0]
    return result
```
In the corrected code, I have modified the handling of the `return_indexers` parameter to ensure that it is appropriately considered in all cases. This should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
