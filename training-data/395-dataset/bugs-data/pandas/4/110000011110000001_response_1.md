The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` is trying to join two multi-indexes `midx1` and `midx2` using the `join` method and setting `return_indexers` to False. Then it tries to assert if the result is equal to `midx1`.

The error message indicates that the comparison is failing because the result is of type tuple instead of the expected type Index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `return` statement in the portion of the code that handles the case where both `self` and `other` are multi-indexes (`self_is_mi and other_is_mi`).

The bug occurs because the function erroneously returns a tuple instead of an Index when both `self` and `other` are multi-indexes. This discrepancy causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to return an Index instead of a tuple in the event that both `self` and `other` are multi-indexes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    # (existing import statements)
    
    # (code for other parts of the function)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        # (code for dropping non-matching levels)
        # (code for joining left and right)

        # Rest of the code remains the same, except the return statement
        multi_join_idx = MultiIndex(
            levels=levels, codes=codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False
        )

        multi_join_idx = multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()
        
        if return_indexers:
            return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx
        else:
            return multi_join_idx

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```
