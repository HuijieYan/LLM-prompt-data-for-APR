The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` creates two MultiIndex objects, `midx1` and `midx2`. It then calls the `join` method on `midx1` with `midx2` as the argument and `return_indexers` set to False. Finally, it attempts to assert that the result of the join is equal to `midx1`.

The error occurs because the return type of the `join` method is a tuple containing three elements: the resulting MultiIndex, and two index arrays. However, the test is expecting the result to be just a MultiIndex, leading to a type mismatch error.

The function `_join_multi` seems to be incorrectly implementing the join logic for MultiIndex objects. This leads to the unexpected return type and format, causing the test failure.

To fix the bug, the `_join_multi` function should be modified to correctly handle the join operation for MultiIndex objects and ensure that it returns only the resulting MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected `_join_multi` function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    join_kwargs = {'how': how, 'return_indexers': return_indexers}
    
    result = self.join(other, **join_kwargs)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, the function simply calls the `join` method on the `self` MultiIndex, passing `other` as the argument and the provided join options. This should ensure that the correct output is returned and the test case should pass without any errors.
