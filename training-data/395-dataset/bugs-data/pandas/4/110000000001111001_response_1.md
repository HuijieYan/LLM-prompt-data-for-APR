The error occurs in the "ValueError" section where it checks for overlap between the index names. If there is no overlap, a ValueError is raised.

The bug seems to be related to the implementation of the _join_multi function. The "overlap" variable is being calculated as the intersection of two sets of index names but it's not being compared properly. This leads to the error message "cannot join with no overlapping index names" when the condition is not met. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the "overlap" set with a condition occurs properly.

Here's the corrected code for the _join_multi function:
```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    from pandas.core.indexes.api import _validate_index_names

    self_names = set(_validate_index_names(self.names))
    other_names = set(_validate_index_names(other.names))
    overlap = self_names.intersection(other_names)

    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, the "overlap" variable is calculated using the intersection method (overlap = self_names.intersection(other_names)), which properly compares the sets of index names to find the common elements. The _validate_index_names function is used to validate the index names before converting them into a set and calculating the overlap.

This approach ensures that the check for overlapping index names is done correctly, preventing the ValueError from being raised incorrectly.
