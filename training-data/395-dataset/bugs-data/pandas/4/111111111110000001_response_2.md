The test case `test_join_multi_return_indexers` is trying to join two MultiIndex objects `midx1` and `midx2` using the `join` method. The `return_indexers` parameter is set to `False`, and the result is then compared with `midx1` using `assert_index_equal` method.

The error message indicates that the `assert_index_equal` method failed because the type of the `result` is a tuple instead of an Index object.

The potential error location within the `_join_multi` function is likely where the result is returned. It seems that the return statement is returning multiple values as a tuple instead of a single Index object.

The bug occurs because the `_join_multi` function is returning multiple values as a tuple instead of a single Index object. This causes the `assert_index_equal` method to fail because it expects the result to be an Index object, not a tuple.

To fix the bug, the `_join_multi` function needs to return a single Index object instead of multiple values as a tuple.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        # ... (omitted code) ...

        return multi_join_idx  # Return a single Index object

    jl = list(overlap)[0]

    # Case where only one index is multi
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    return result  # Return a single Index object
```
