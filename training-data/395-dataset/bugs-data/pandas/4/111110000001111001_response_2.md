The bug in the '_join_multi' function seems to be related to the logic for handling MultiIndex objects. It appears that the code is intended to perform a join operation between two MultiIndex objects, but there are issues with how the levels and names are handled, resulting in unexpected behavior.

One possible issue is that the code does not account for `ldrop_names` and `rdrop_names` when determining the levels to join. This may lead to unexpected behavior when trying to join the MultiIndex objects.

Another issue is the re-creation of the MultiIndex after performing the join operation. The re-ordering and re-creation of the MultiIndex seems to be causing the unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully handle the levels and names when performing the join operation. Additionally, we should ensure that the re-creation of the MultiIndex is done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the '_join_multi' function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    
    # figure out join names
    self_names = set(self.names)
    other_names = set(other.names)
    overlap = self_names & other_names
    
    # need at least 1 in common
    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")
    
    self_is_mi = isinstance(self, MultiIndex)
    other_is_mi = isinstance(other, MultiIndex)
    
    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        ldrop_names = list(self_names - overlap)
        rdrop_names = list(other_names - overlap)
    
        # Join left and right
        # Join on same leveled multi-index frames is supported
        join_idx, lidx, ridx = self.join(
            other, how, return_indexers=True
        )
    
        return join_idx, lidx, ridx
    
    jl = list(overlap)[0]
    
    # Case where only one index is multi
    # make the indices into mi's that match
    flip_order = False
    if self_is_mi:
        self, other = other, self
        flip_order = True
        # flip if join method is right or left
        how = {"right": "left", "left": "right"}.get(how, how)
    
    level = other.names.index(jl)
    result = self._join_level(
        other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers
    )
    
    if flip_order:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            return result[0], result[2], result[1]
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we eliminate the unnecessary re-creation of MultiIndex and carefully handle the levels and names when performing the join operation.
