The error occurs because the `join` method should return a `MultiIndex` object, but it returned a tuple instead, which caused the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `join` method is in the return statement, where it should return a `MultiIndex` type but instead returns a tuple.

The bug occurred because the `_join_multi` function was returning a tuple instead of a `MultiIndex`. This was due to the variable `join_idx, lidx, ridx` being assigned a tuple of values, which caused the returned value to be a tuple.

To fix the bug, the `_join_multi` function should return only the `join_idx` value, as it represents the joined multi-index. The other values, `lidx` and `ridx`, should not be returned. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    # ... (other parts of the code remain unchanged)
    
    return join_idx
```
By making this change, the function will only return the `join_idx` value, ensuring that the return type is a `MultiIndex` as expected.
