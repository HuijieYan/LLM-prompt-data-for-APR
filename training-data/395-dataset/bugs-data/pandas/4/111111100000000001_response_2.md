This function appears to have several issues that could be leading to bugs:

1. The variable `com` is used without being defined. It is likely a reference to a module, but it needs to be imported or defined before use.
2. The variable `self.names` and `other.names` are used without being defined. These values need to be passed in to the function or calculated within the function.
3. The function seems to be trying to join two multi-indexes, but it's assuming what types `self` and `other` are without checking.
4. There are some implicit assumptions about the content of `self.names` and `other.names` which may lead to incorrect behavior if those assumptions are false.

To fix these issues, the following changes can be made:

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.api import com
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin

    self_names = set(com.not_none(*self.levels))
    other_names = set(com.not_none(*other.levels))
    overlap = self_names & other_names

    if not overlap:
        raise ValueError("cannot join with no overlapping index names")

    self_is_mi = isinstance(self, MultiIndex)
    other_is_mi = isinstance(other, MultiIndex)

    if self_is_mi and other_is_mi:
        if not all(name in self.names for name in overlap) or not all(name in other.names for name in overlap):
            raise ValueError("overlap names not present in both MultiIndexes")

        ldrop_names = list(self_names - overlap)
        rdrop_names = list(other_names - overlap)

        self_jnlevels = self.droplevel(ldrop_names)
        other_jnlevels = other.droplevel(rdrop_names)

        join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(
            other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True
        )

        dropped_names = ldrop_names + rdrop_names

        levels, codes, names = _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin(
            self, other, dropped_names, join_idx, lidx, ridx
        )

        multi_join_idx = MultiIndex(
            levels=levels, codes=codes, names=names, verify_integrity=False
        )

        multi_join_idx = multi_join_idx.remove_unused_levels()

        return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx

    jl = list(overlap)[0]

    if self_is_mi and jl not in self.names:
        raise ValueError("overlap name not present in MultiIndex")

    if other_is_mi and jl not in other.names:
        raise ValueError("overlap name not present in MultiIndex")

    flip_order = False
    if self_is_mi:
        self, other = other, self
        flip_order = True
        how = {"right": "left", "left": "right"}.get(how, how)
    
    level = other.names.index(jl)
    result = self._join_level(other, level, how=how, return_indexers=return_indexers)

    if flip_order:
        if isinstance(result, tuple):
            return result[0], result[2], result[1]
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `com` module is imported, and the `self.names`, `other.names`, and levels are used appropriately. The potential bugs and issues found in the original code are addressed in the corrected code.
