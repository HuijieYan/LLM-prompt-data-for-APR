The issue seems to be with the `_join_multi` function not respecting the value of the `return_indexers` parameter and always returning indexers. This is evident from the expected output and the actual output, where the indexers were not supposed to be returned but were returned anyway.

The potential error location is within the `_join_multi` function where the `return_indexers` parameter is not being respected.

The bug occurs because the code in the `_join_multi` function is not properly handling the `return_indexers` parameter. It seems to always be set to `True` regardless of the input value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the value of the `return_indexers` parameter is respected and used appropriately within the `_join_multi` function.

```python
def _join_multi(self, other, how, return_indexers=True):
    from pandas.core.indexes.multi import MultiIndex
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import _restore_dropped_levels_multijoin
    
    # ... (omitted code) ...
    
    # Join left and right
    # Join on same leveled multi-index frames is supported
    if return_indexers:
        join_idx, lidx, ridx = self_jnlevels.join(other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=True)
    else:
        join_idx = self_jnlevels.join(other_jnlevels, how, return_indexers=False)
        lidx, ridx = None, None

    # ... (omitted code) ...
    
    return multi_join_idx, lidx, ridx  # update the return value to return join index and possibly the indexers
```

In the corrected code, we check the value of the `return_indexers` parameter and then pass it to the `join` function accordingly. If `return_indexers` is `True`, then we return the indexers as before. If it is `False`, then we do not return the indexers, and set `lidx` and `ridx` to `None`.

This correction ensures that the `return_indexers` parameter is respected, and the function returns the correct output based on the input value of `return_indexers`.
