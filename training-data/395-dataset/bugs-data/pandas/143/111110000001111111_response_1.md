The buggy function is `get_indexer` in the `RangeIndex` class. This function seems to have a conditional statement that is not working as expected. The conditional checks if `method` is `None`, `tolerance` is `None`, and `target` is a list-like object. If these conditions are not met, it returns the result of the superclass `get_indexer` function, passing the `target`, `method`, and `tolerance` as arguments.

The bug seems to be related to the conditional statement not correctly identifying the input parameters and not properly handling the conditions.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to correctly identify the input parameter types and handle the conditions according to the expected behavior. We also need to ensure that the conditions and their respective outcomes are in agreement with the expected functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if not (method is None and tolerance is None and isinstance(target, (list, pd.Index))):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)
    
        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step
    
        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code ensures that the conditional statement correctly identifies the input parameters and handles the conditions according to the expected behavior. This should resolve the bug related to the conditional logic in the `get_indexer` function.
