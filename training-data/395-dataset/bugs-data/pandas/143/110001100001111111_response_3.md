The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. When the method parameter is not None and the tolerance is not None, or when the target is not list-like, the function should return the result of calling the same method from the parent class. However, the implementation in the buggy function does not handle these cases correctly.

The bug occurs because the conditions `method is None` and `tolerance is None` are incorrectly combined with `is_list_like(target)`. This results in incorrect behavior when determining whether to call the parent class method or handle the logic within the `get_indexer` method.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the cases where the method and tolerance are not None, or the target is not list-like, needs to be revised. The conditions should be checked separately, and the decision to call the parent class method should be based on each individual condition.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)
    
        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to the general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step
    
        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

The corrected function now checks the conditions separately and correctly determines whether to call the parent class method or handle the logic within the `get_indexer` method.
