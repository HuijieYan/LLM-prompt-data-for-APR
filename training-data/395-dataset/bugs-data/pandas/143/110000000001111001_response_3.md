The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the conditions for returning the result. The function first checks if the method and tolerance are None and the target is a list-like object, and if this condition is not met, it returns the result of the superclass method. However, in the given context, it seems that this condition might not be correctly handling the input parameters.

It is also important to note that the function uses numpy methods and the conditions involving step, start, and stop to calculate the result.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be implemented:
1. Update the condition for returning the result based on the input parameters provided in the test cases.
2. Ensure that the calculation involving `start`, `stop`, and `step` is correctly implemented to handle the index.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = self.stop - 1, self.start - 1, -self.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected code, the condition for returning the result is updated to consider the method and tolerance separately. Additionally, the calculation involving `start`, `stop`, and `step` is updated to handle the index correctly based on the conditions.
