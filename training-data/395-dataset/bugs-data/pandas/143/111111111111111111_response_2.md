The issue seems to be related to the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class, which is used by the `DataFrame.reindex` method.

In the error messages, it is indicated that the values after reindexing are not as expected, and this discrepancy is observed in both the DataFrame and the NumPy array.

Upon review of the `get_indexer` method, it appears that the method is not handling the `limit` parameter correctly. The `limit` parameter is intended to limit the number of forward/backward fills. In the existing implementation, this parameter is not being considered, resulting in an incorrect reindexing.

To resolve this issue, the `limit` parameter needs to be properly incorporated into the `get_indexer` method to limit the number of forward/backward fills as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if limit is not None and method in ["pad", "ffill"]:
        forward_fill = method in ["pad", "ffill"]
        idx = self.get_indexer_non_unique(target)
        if forward_fill:
            idx = self._limit_reindex_fill(method, idx, limit)
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Backward fill limit is not implemented yet.")
        return idx
    else:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In this corrected implementation:
1. We first check if the `limit` parameter is not None and the `method` is either "pad" or "ffill."
2. If the conditions are met, we use the `_limit_reindex_fill` method to apply the forward fill with the specified limit.
3. We return the modified index (`idx`) if the conditions hold true.
4. If the conditions are not met, we fall back to the default behavior by calling the `super().get_indexer` method.

This approach properly integrates the `limit` parameter into the `get_indexer` method, ensuring that forward fills are limited as specified.

After applying this change, the issues raised by the test functions should be resolved.
