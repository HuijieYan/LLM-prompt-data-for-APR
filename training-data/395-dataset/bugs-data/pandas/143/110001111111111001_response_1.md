The bug is likely occurring in the "get_indexer" function. This function is responsible for returning the indices of the elements in the target array in relation to the original array. The bug is causing the expected and actual results to differ in the tests.

The issue seems to be originating from the logic that is handling the target range and step. When the step is greater than 0, the correct behavior is to use the start, stop, and step values from the range. However, when the step is less than or equal to 0, the code erroneously reverses the range and also performs some incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately handle the cases when the step is less than or equal to 0 and ensure that the calculations for valid indices are correct.

Here's the corrected implementation of the "get_indexer" function:

```python
from pandas.api.extensions import Appender
from pandas.core.common import is_list_like
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer_dtype
from pandas.core.indexers import ensure_platform_int, lib, _NDFrameIndexer

class RangeIndex:
    def __init__(self, start, stop, step):
        self.start = start
        self.stop = stop
        self.step = step

    @Appender
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            start, stop, step = self.stop - self.step, self.start - 1, -self.step

        target_array = lib.to_object_array(target)

        locs, index = lib.get_indexer_non_unique(target_array, (start, stop, step), sort=False)

        if limit is not None:
            locs_limit = lib.get_indexer_non_unique(target_array, (start, stop, step), sort=True)
            moved_to_limit = locs_limit != -1
            under_limit = moved_to_limit & ((locs_limit >= 0) & (locs_limit < limit))
            locs[moved_to_limit & ~under_limit] = -1

        return ensure_platform_int(index)
```

The corrected code addresses the issues with reversing the range and correctly identifies the valid indices. This should resolve the problems with the test cases and error messages.
