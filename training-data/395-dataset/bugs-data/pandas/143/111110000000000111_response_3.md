The bug seems to be related to the reindexing method in pandas DataFrame not following the limit parameter as expected. This bug seems to be present in both pandas versions 0.24.2 and 0.25.1.

Upon analyzing the provided code, the potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_indexer` method, specifically in the conditional statement `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)):`. This conditional statement seems to be incorrectly checking the input parameters and may be causing the method to behave unexpectedly.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement is not effectively checking if the method should proceed with the given input parameters. This leads to unexpected behavior when reindexing the DataFrame, resulting in the limit parameter not being honored.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to revise the conditional statement to correctly check the input parameters and their validity. Additionally, handling the limit parameter correctly within the `get_indexer` method is necessary to ensure that it is honored during reindexing.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target) and limit is not None):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    # Rest of the method remains the same
    # ...

    # honor the limit parameter during reindexing
    test1 = test1.reindex([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], method="ffill", limit=1)

    # ...

# Rest of the class code remains the same
# ...
``` 

By revising the conditional statement and ensuring that the limit parameter is correctly used within the `get_indexer` method, the bug should be fixed.
