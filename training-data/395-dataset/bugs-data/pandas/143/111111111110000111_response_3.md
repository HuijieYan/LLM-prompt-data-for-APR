The error messages from the test functions indicate that the bug is related to reindexing and does not follow the limit restriction as expected. Specifically, the `method="ffill", limit=1` does not limit the data from continuing to fill forward.

The potential error in the problematic function is in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. It seems that the conditions used to check the `method` and `tolerance` are not properly implemented, leading to incorrect indexing.

The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the `method` and `tolerance` parameters. In the `get_indexer` method, the condition to check the `method` and `tolerance` is currently written as `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))`. This condition does not account for the given values of `method` and `tolerance` parameters and hence does not work as intended.

To fix this bug, the faulty condition to check the `method` and `tolerance` should be improved. The condition should properly handle the cases when `method` and `tolerance` are provided, and the logic for indexing should be updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected function for the `get_indexer` method in the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code properly handles the conditions for the `method` and `tolerance` parameters and should resolve the bug in the reindexing behavior.
