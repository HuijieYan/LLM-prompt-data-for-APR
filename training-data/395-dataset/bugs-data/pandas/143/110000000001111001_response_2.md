The buggy function `get_indexer` appears to be designed to calculate the index of the target value within a specified range. However, the function is failing due to a flawed conditional check for the method, tolerance, and target variables, and the subsequent associated logic.

The buggy function checks whether `method` and `tolerance` are both None and if the `target` is list-like. If the condition is not met, it calls the `super().get_indexer` method. However, this check's intent is unclear and seems unnecessary, attempting to handle multiple different scenarios within this single function.

To fix this bug, the unnecessary conditional checks and their associated logic need to be removed, and the logic for calculating the target index within the specified range needs to be revised.

The corrected code for the `get_indexer` function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, tolerance=None):
    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    if step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop + 1, self.start, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The unnecessary conditional check at the beginning of the function has been removed to focus on calculating the index of the target value within the specified range.
2. The calculation of the start, stop, and step values has been revised to ensure correctness.
3. The logic to calculate the index of the target within the range has been improved and simplified.
