The error in the `get_indexer` method is likely due to the condition `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))`. This condition is checking if method is None, tolerance is None, and if the target is list-like. If any of these conditions are not met, the method then returns the result of the `super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)` call. This may be incorrect because if any of these conditions are not met, it does not necessarily mean that the `super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)` call needs to be executed. 

To fix this, a better approach would be to use a try-except block to handle the case where the conditions are not met and then execute the necessary code. If the conditions are not met, then it can simply proceed with the rest of the code inside the function. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    try:
        if method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target):
            if self.step > 0:
                start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
            else:
                # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
                start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

            target_array = np.asarray(target)
            if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
                # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
                return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

            locs = target_array - start
            valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
            locs[~valid] = -1
            locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

            if step != self.step:
                # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
                locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
            return ensure_platform_int(locs)
        else:
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    except:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
```
