The error occurs in the `get_indexer` function. The bug seems to be in the condition check where the `method` and `tolerance` are being checked. The bug's impact is evident from the test cases where the expected and actual results do not match, causing assertion errors.

It appears that when the `method` and `tolerance` are not None and the `target` is not list-like, the function should return the result from the super class, but the condition is incorrectly checking for it. This could be the potential error location.

The bug occurs because the condition check for `method` and `tolerance` is wrong, leading to incorrect behavior when the condition is not met.

To fix the bug, the condition check for `method`, `tolerance`, and `target` should be corrected. This will ensure that the correct behavior is observed based on the condition. Additionally, the logic within the `if` block and the `else` block should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure correct execution.

Here's the corrected `get_indexer` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With the corrected condition check and logic, the function should now behave as expected and the associated test functions should pass without any assertion errors.
