The error message from the test functions indicates that there is a difference in the output of the function `get_indexer` in the `RangeIndex` class. The calculations within the function are causing this discrepancy.

The bug is occurring because the if condition `(method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))` is not being evaluated as expected. As a result, the wrong branch of the code is executed.

To fix the bug, we need to rewrite the `get_indexer` function by ensuring that the conditions are checked correctly. This way, the correct branch of the code is executed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target):
        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1:
            locs = target_array - start
            valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
            locs[~valid] = -1
            locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step

            if step != self.step:
                # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
                locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
            return ensure_platform_int(locs)
    return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
```

This modified code includes the correct if condition checks to ensure that the correct branch of the code is executed based on the inputs.
