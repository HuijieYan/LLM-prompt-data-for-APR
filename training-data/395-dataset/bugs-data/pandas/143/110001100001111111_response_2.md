The issue seems to be related to the `reindex` method of the DataFrame, which is not correctly following the `limit` parameter in the newer version of pandas (0.25.1).

The bug seems to be located in the `get_indexer` function, specifically in the conditional statement that checks for the method and tolerance. It appears that the condition is erroneously implemented, and as a result, the `limit` parameter is not properly considered.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement for the method and tolerance is checking for a different condition than the expected behavior when the `limit` parameter is provided.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should also check for the existence of the `limit` parameter and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_integer_dtype
import numpy as np

# other functions

@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target) or limit is not None:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

The corrected code now includes a check for the `limit` parameter in the conditional statement. If the `limit` parameter is not None, it will be appropriately handled. This should address the issue where the `limit` parameter is not being properly considered in the `reindex` method.
