Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the RangeIndex class due to the conditional statements and calculations.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug may be caused by the if condition `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))` which seems to be incorrect. It should be checking if the method and tolerance are not None and if the target is list-like. Additionally, there are calculations and condition checks that may not be handling the input parameters and data correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional statement to correctly check if method and tolerance are not None, and if the target is list-like.
2. Verify the calculations and condition checks to ensure they handle the input parameters and data appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from numpy.core.numeric import is_integer_dtype, is_list_like
from pandas._libs import ensure_platform_int
import numpy as np
