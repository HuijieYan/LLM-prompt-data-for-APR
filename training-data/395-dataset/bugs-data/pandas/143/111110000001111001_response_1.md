The buggy function is a method called "get_indexer" inside a class called "RangeIndex". The purpose of the method is to get the indexer for a given target based on the range index.

The function seems to be designed to handle cases where the "method" and "tolerance" parameters are not provided and the "target" is a list-like object. It also seems to handle the case where the step of the RangeIndex is greater than 0 and when it is less than or equal to 0.


## Issue in the Buggy Code:
The issue seems to be with the conditional statement `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))`, as it always evaluates as True and the subsequent block of code is executed. This might not be the intended behavior, and it is causing the function to return a value from the superclass without performing the necessary logic for the given conditions. Additionally, the condition seems to wrongly assume that "is_list_like" would meet the expected behavior.

## Correction Approach:
1. Check the condition for "is_list_like" to ensure it is correctly used to identify list-like objects.
2. Handle the case where "method" and "tolerance" are not supplied and the "target" is list-like.

## Corrected Code:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    # handle case where method, tolerance are None and target is a list-like object
    if method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target):
        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
    else:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
```
In the corrected code, an additional check is added to ensure that the condition for "method" and "tolerance" is handled correctly. If the condition is satisfied, the original logic for determining the indexer is executed. If not, the control is passed to the superclass method.
