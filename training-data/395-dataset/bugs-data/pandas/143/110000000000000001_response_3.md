Potential error location: The potential error is in the if statement at the beginning of the function, where it checks if the method and tolerance are None, and if the target is a list-like object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the condition in the if statement is not being evaluated correctly. It is not handling the case where method and tolerance are None and target is not list-like.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the if statement to check whether method and tolerance are both None and if target is list-like. We also need to handle the case where either method or tolerance is not None, or if target is not list-like.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
