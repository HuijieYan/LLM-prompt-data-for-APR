Based on the provided issue description, the bug seems to be related to the `reindex` method not following the specified limit parameter in pandas versions 0.24.2 and 0.25.1. The issue might be occurring due to an error in the `get_indexer` function within the `RangeIndex` class.

The potential error location is within the `get_indexer` function of the `RangeIndex` class, where the condition `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))` might not be evaluating as expected, leading to the wrong execution path.

The bug occurs because the conditional check in the `get_indexer` function may not be ensuring that the method and tolerance parameters are None and checking if the target is list-like as expected. This could be causing the wrong path to be taken in the function, leading to unexpected behavior when reindexing a DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the `get_indexer` function to ensure that the method and tolerance parameters are None and check if the target is list-like. Additionally, we need to include the necessary imports for the required functions and classes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `get_indexer` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_integer_dtype, is_list_like
from pandas.core.indexes.numeric import Int64Index
from pandas.core.algorithms import ensure_platform_int
from pandas.core.indexes.common import _index_shared_docs
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender

class RangeIndex(Int64Index):
    # ... (other methods and attributes) ...

    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target):
            if self.step > 0:
                start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
            else:
                start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)
            
            target_array = np.asarray(target)
            if is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1:
                locs = target_array - start
                valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
                locs[~valid] = -1
                locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

                if step != self.step:
                    locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
                return ensure_platform_int(locs)
        
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
```

In this corrected code, we have fixed the conditional check to ensure that the method and tolerance parameters are None and the target is list-like. Additionally, we have included the necessary imports for the required functions and classes. This should address the bug related to the `reindex` method not following the specified limit parameter in pandas versions 0.24.2 and 0.25.1.
