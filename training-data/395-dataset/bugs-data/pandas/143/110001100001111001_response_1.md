The buggy function `get_indexer` is designed to return an indexer for the requested target using the RangeIndex properties. However, currently, there's an issue in the function logic that needs to be fixed.

The function fails to compare the datatypes of the `target` variable, and it directly assumes that it's an Int64Index. Due to this, the function faces issues when dealing with RangeIndex.

To fix this issue, a check needs to be included to handle the different types of indexes, such as Int64Index and RangeIndex.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

        if isinstance(target, pd.Int64Index):
            target_array = np.asarray(target)
        elif isinstance(target, pd.RangeIndex):
            target_array = np.array(target)
        else:
            raise TypeError("target should be either Int64Index or RangeIndex")

        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

        if isinstance(target, pd.Int64Index):
            locs = target_array - start
            valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
            locs[~valid] = -1
            locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step
        elif isinstance(target, pd.RangeIndex):
            locs = target_array
            valid = (locs >= start) & (locs < stop)
            locs[~valid] = -1
            locs[valid] = (locs[valid] - start) // step

        if step != self.step:
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]

        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected function, the code has been modified to handle different types of indexes: Int64Index and RangeIndex. It first checks the type of the `target` variable and then proceeds accordingly. If the target is of type pd.Int64Index, it continues with existing logic. If the target is of type pd.RangeIndex, it applies the logic tailored for this type of index. This ensures that the function works correctly for both Int64Index and RangeIndex inputs.
