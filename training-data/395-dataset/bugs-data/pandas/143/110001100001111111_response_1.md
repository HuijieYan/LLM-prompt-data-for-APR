Potential Error Location:
The issue appears to be with the logic that checks for the method, tolerance, and target type in the `get_indexer` function.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the conditional check for the method, tolerance, and target type is not functioning as expected. This is causing the function to return the result of `super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)` even when it should not.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can improve the conditional logic to properly check for the method, tolerance, and target type, and only execute the subsequent code if all conditions are met. Additionally, we need to handle the cases where method, tolerance, and target type are not as expected.

Corrected Code:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.base import ensure_platform_int

def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not isinstance(target, (Int64Index, RangeIndex)):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Reverse the range for simplicity
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    # Return the final result
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

The above code addresses the issue by correcting the conditional logic and returning the correct result based on the input parameters. This should ensure that the function operates as intended and returns the expected indexers.
