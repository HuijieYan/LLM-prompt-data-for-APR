The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)):`, which checks whether the 'method' and 'tolerance' values are None and whether the 'target' is a list-like object.

The error occurs because in both cases, since 'method' and 'tolerance' are not None and 'target' is not list-like, the code execution goes inside the conditional statement and returns the value from `super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)`. This is incorrect behavior, as it should not bypass the following condition checks if the 'target' is not list-like.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement should be updated to consider each condition separately. The desired behavior is to execute the standard logic if any of these conditions are met (method is not None, tolerance is not None, target is not list-like), instead of only when all of them are True.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
