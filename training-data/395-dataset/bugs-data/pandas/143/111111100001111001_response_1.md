The buggy function `get_indexer` is checking if the `method` is None and if `tolerance` is None and if the `target` is list-like. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns the result of the parent class's `get_indexer` method. Otherwise, it performs a series of operations to calculate the indexer.

The bug is likely caused by an inappropriate condition check at the beginning of the function. The condition `if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target))` does not cover all cases, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the condition check should be revised to accurately capture the intent of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)
    
        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step
    
        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
