The error message indicates that there is a difference in values between the expected and actual results. This is likely due to a bug in the `get_indexer` function provided. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the `locs` variable and its subsequent use.

The current code tries to handle special cases when the `method`, `tolerance` and `target` parameters meet certain conditions. However, the check for the condition in the `if` statement is incorrect.

To fix the bug, you can revise the conditions for entering the special case handling and modify the way the `locs` variable is calculated and used.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
from pandas.api.types import is_list_like
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.indexes.range import RangeIndex
from pandas._libs.missing import isna
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer_dtype
from pandas._libs.lib import ensure_platform_int


# Corrected get_indexer function
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    result = super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return result

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return result  # Return the original result if not meeting the integer and 1-dimensional array conditions

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] //= step  # Use floor division for integer result

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]

    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In this corrected code, the conditions for entering the special case handling are adjusted, and the calculation of `locs` and its usage is modified to handle integer division and ensure that the correct indexing is applied to the target array.
