The cause of the error in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class is that the conditional logic inside the method is not handling the case where the `method` is not `None` and `tolerance` is not `None` separately. When `method` and `tolerance` are not `None`, it should return the result of calling the superclass method. However, the current implementation does not handle this case properly.

To fix this, the conditional logic needs to be modified to properly handle the case where both `method` and `tolerance` are not `None`.

Here's the corrected `get_indexer` method:

```python
    # this is the corrected get_indexer method
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if method is not None or tolerance is not None:
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
        
        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This fix adds a check for both `method` and `tolerance` being not `None` and returns the result of calling the superclass method in this case. It also retains the existing logic for handling other cases.

The corrected `get_indexer` method should resolve the error in the test cases.
