The error occurs in the `get_indexer` method where the conditions for method and tolerance checks are incorrect. This leads to an improper calculation and incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function checks whether the input is a list-like object and only performs certain operations if `method` and `tolerance` are `None`. This is incorrect, as the method and tolerance should also be checked regardless of the type of the `target` variable.

To fix the bug, the conditions for method and tolerance checks need to be removed from the if statement and checked separately. The `limit` parameter also needs to be considered in the code to ensure the correct indexing operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is None and tolerance is None and limit is None and is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

By adding the `limit` parameter check and removing the unnecessary condition in the if statement, the bug should be fixed, and the erroneous test cases should pass successfully.
