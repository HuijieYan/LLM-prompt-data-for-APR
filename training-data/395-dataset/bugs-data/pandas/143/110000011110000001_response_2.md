The error in the `get_indexer` method seems to be causing differences in the test results. The test case is related to reindexing a DataFrame and getting the indexer for a RangeIndex with a limit.

The potential error could be in the logic used to calculate the `start`, `stop`, and `step` variables. There might also be issues with how the `locs` are calculated and used.

The bug might be occurring due to incorrect calculations of the locs and the validity check for locs. This could result in incorrect indexes being returned, leading to differences in the test results.

To fix the bug, consider revisiting the logic for calculating `start`, `stop`, and `step`, as well as the calculation of `locs` and its validity. It might also be helpful to review the conditions for different paths in the function to ensure they cover all relevant cases.

Here's the corrected `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or tolerance is not None or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = self.stop + 1, self.start - 1, -self.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (np.issubdtype(target_array.dtype, np.integer) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = (target_array - start) // step
    valid = (locs >= 0) & (locs < len(self)) & ((locs * step + start) == target_array)
    locs[~valid] = -1

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return locs
```

This corrected method includes revised logic for calculating `start`, `stop`, and `step` and updates the calculation for `locs` and its validity. It also makes use of the NumPy functions for checking integer type and performing calculations.
