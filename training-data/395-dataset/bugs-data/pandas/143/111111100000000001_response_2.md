The bug in the provided code is that the overridden get_indexer method in the RangeIndex class is not properly handling the condition when method is not None and tolerance is not None. In this case, it should call the superclass method, but the condition is only checking for is_list_like(target).

The potential location of the error is the if statement where it checks for the condition (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)).

The bug occurred because the condition is only checking for method and tolerance, but it should also check for target.

To fix the bug, the condition in the overridden get_indexer method should be modified to: if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)) or target.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if not (method is None and tolerance is None and is_list_like(target)) or target:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
