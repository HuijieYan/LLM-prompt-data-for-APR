Potential error location: The `get_indexer` method in the `RangeIndex` class seems to be causing the error. This method is intended to return an indexer for non-monotonic targets. However, it appears that it might not be handling the boundary cases and target values correctly, leading to incorrect indexing.

Reason for the bug: The error message from the test functions indicates that the values returned by the `get_indexer` method are different from the expected values. It seems that the method is not handling the limit parameter and method "pad" correctly, which is resulting in incorrect indexing.

Possible approach to fix the bug: The `get_indexer` method should be modified to correctly handle the limit parameter and method "pad". The implementation should ensure that it returns the correct indexer for the given target, method, and limit.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if not is_list_like(target):
        raise TypeError("Target should be a list-like object.")

    if method != "pad":
        # If the method is not "pad", fall back to the superclass method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    start = self.start
    stop = self.stop
    step = self.step

    if stop < start:
        # The range is descending, so need to reverse it for simplicity
        start, stop, step = stop - 1, start - 1, -step

    result = np.full(len(target), -1, dtype=np.int64)

    for i, t in enumerate(target):
        if start <= t < stop:
            loc = (t - start) // step
            if limit is not None and loc > limit:
                result[i] = -1
            else:
                result[i] = loc
        elif t >= stop:
            # Handle the case where target value lies beyond the range
            result[i] = -1

    return result
```

This corrected implementation should properly handle the "pad" method and the limit parameter while returning the indexer for the given target range. It also considers both ascending and descending ranges to ensure the correct indexing.
