The error in the provided test cases is due to a bug in the `get_indexer` method. In the `get_indexer` method, the logic for handling the `method` and `limit` parameters is incorrect, which is causing the reindexing to not work as expected.

The issue is that the `get_indexer` method is not correctly handling the `method` and `limit` parameters. When `method` and `limit` are not None and `target` is not a list-like object, the method returns the result of the superclass's `get_indexer` method. This behavior is incorrect and doesn't account for the `method` and `limit` parameters.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be updated to properly handle the `method` and `limit` parameters. It should apply the specified method and limit when reindexing the data, in accordance with the provided test cases.

Here's the corrected `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if method is not None or limit is not None:
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected code, the method checks if `method` or `limit` is not None and then calls the superclass's `get_indexer` method with the `method` and `limit` parameters. This ensures that the specified method and limit are applied when reindexing the data.

By fixing the logic in the `get_indexer` method, the issue with reindexing not working as expected due to incorrect handling of the `method` and `limit` parameters should be resolved.
