The error occurs when the `groupby` method is called with the parameter `group_name` set to 'x' or ['x'] and `axis=1` in the `test_groupby_axis_1` test case. The code raises a `KeyError` when trying to group by the column name 'x'.

The bug is likely to be in the `_get_grouper` function. It fails to properly handle the case when grouping by column names with `axis=1`.

This bug occurs because the function does not appropriately handle the grouping logic for column names when `axis=1`. It mistakenly treats the column name as an index level reference rather than accepting it as a column name.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling column names when `axis=1` should be modified to correctly identify and group by the specified column names. By adjusting the conditional checks and routes for column names, the function can correctly handle the grouping by column names.

Here's the corrected function code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, str)):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Other existing logic and blocks remain unchanged
    # ... 

    groupings = []
    exclusions = []

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # Adjust the logic for handling column names
        if level is None and isinstance(gpr, str):
            level = gpr
            gpr = None

        # Handle the case for grouping by column name
        if level is None and isinstance(gpr, str):
            in_axis, name, level = True, gpr, None
            exclusions.append(name)

        # Other existing logic and blocks remain unchanged
        # ...

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

With these changes, the `_get_grouper` function should now correctly handle the grouping by column names when `axis=1`. This updated logic ensures that the groupings by column name are appropriately handled.
