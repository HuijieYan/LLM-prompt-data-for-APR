The error in the `_get_grouper` function occurs due to a KeyError when trying to group by columns. This is unexpected because the intent is to group by columns using the "x" column label.

The bug occurs in the section of the function that handles the grouping by columns. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying the keys for grouping when the "by" argument is passed for columns.

To fix this issue, we need to update the logic for handling the "by" argument when grouping by columns. This may involve properly identifying the keys for grouping and ensuring that the grouping by columns is done correctly.

Here's the corrected function for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing function code

    # new logic for grouping by columns
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):  # group by single column name
        key = [key]  # convert key to list

    # existing function code

    # corrected return statement
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

This updated logic checks if the grouping is being done by columns and if the key is a string. If so, it converts the key to a list. This should address the issue of KeyError when trying to group by columns in the original `_get_grouper` function.
