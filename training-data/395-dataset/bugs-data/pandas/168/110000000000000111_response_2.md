The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the logic that deals with grouping along columns.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for grouping by columns is not functioning as expected. The function is not correctly handling the grouping by column names.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the logic for handling grouping by column names to ensure it correctly identifies and groups by the specified column names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if not isinstance(group_axis, Index):
        return NotImplementedError("Grouping along columns is only supported for DataFrame")

    if key is not None:
        if level is not None:
            raise ValueError("Cannot specify both 'key' and 'level'")

        if isinstance(key, str):
            if key not in obj:
                raise KeyError(f"Column '{key}' not found in the DataFrame")
            key = obj[key]

    grouper = BaseGrouper(
        group_axis,
        [Grouping(group_axis, key, obj=obj, sort=sort, observed=observed)],
        sort=sort,
        mutated=mutated,
    )

    return grouper, [], obj
```

This corrected code includes the logic to validate and handle the grouping by column names in a DataFrame. It checks for the presence of the specified column name and creates the grouper accordingly.
