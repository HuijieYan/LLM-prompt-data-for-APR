The test function `test_groupby_axis_1` is aimed at testing the functionality of the `df.groupby` method with different inputs. In this case, it's testing the `groupby` method with different axis values, such as `axis=1`. The purpose of this test is to check if the sum of the grouped data matches the expected outcome.

The error message indicates a `KeyError`, specifically with the key "x". The error seems to originate from the `groupby` function called within the test function.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be where the function tries to interpret the `group_name` input. This is evident from the error message, which indicates that the passed key is 'x' and it's not found.

The bug occurs due to the faulty interpretation of the input key that leads to a mismatch in searching for the specified key, resulting in a `KeyError`. This could be due to indexing issues or improper handling of the passed key.

To fix this issue, first, the function needs to correctly interpret the input key by handling both string and list inputs appropriately. Then, it needs to handle the interpretation of the input key to ensure that it aligns with the data object on which the `groupby` operation is being performed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True):
    # ... (existing implementation)

    # Validate key to handle both string and list input
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = key[0]

    # Perform a check to ensure the passed key is in the object
    if key not in obj:
        raise KeyError(key)

    # ... (remaining implementation)
```

In the corrected code, we first ensure that the key is properly interpreted as a string value if it's in list format. Then, we perform a validation check to ensure that the passed key exists in the object, and if not, raise a `KeyError`. These modifications aim to handle the input key correctly and avoid the occurrence of a `KeyError`.
