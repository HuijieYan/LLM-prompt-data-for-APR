The error occurs in the `_get_grouper` function, specifically in the logic associated with handling the `key` parameter for column names when performing grouping along columns. The bug is causing a KeyError to be raised when attempting to group by columns using the 'x' label.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic for handling column names might not be correctly identifying the `key` as a list of column names when it is provided as such. This is leading to the KeyError when trying to access the provided column name for grouping.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Update the logic for handling the `key` parameter in the `_get_grouper` function to correctly identify the provided `key` as a list of column names when it is provided as a list, rather than raising a KeyError.
2. Check if the `key` is a list, and if so, handle it as a list of column names for grouping along columns.

Here's the corrected `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # existing implementation...

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # new logic for handling key as list of column names
    if isinstance(keys, list):
        key = keys
        match_axis_length = True

    # existing implementation...
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected function should resolve the KeyError issue when trying to group by columns with the provided column names.
