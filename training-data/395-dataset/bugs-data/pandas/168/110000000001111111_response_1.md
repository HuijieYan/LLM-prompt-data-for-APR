The bug is likely occurring in the function `_get_grouper` because it fails to group by columns when the `axis` parameter is set to 1.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the grouping based on column names correctly. The code tries to group by columns based on the `key` parameter when `axis=1`, but it fails to do so.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle grouping by column names correctly when `axis=1`. The function should check if `axis=1`, and if so, use the `key` parameter to group by columns.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    if axis == 1 and isinstance(key, str):
        group_axis = obj[key]
        grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
        return grouper, [], obj
    else:
        group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)
        # ... rest of the function ...
```

In the corrected function, when `axis` is 1 and `key` is a string, it uses the column name to create a `BaseGrouper` and returns the result.

This change should fix the bug by allowing the function to correctly group by columns when `axis` is set to 1 and a valid column name is provided as the `key` parameter.
