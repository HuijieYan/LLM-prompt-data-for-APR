The test case `test_from_2d_ndarray_with_dtype` is attempting to create a DataFrame from a 2D ndarray `array_dim2` with a specified dtype of `"datetime64[ns, UTC]"`. However, the error message indicates that the `ValueError` is raised due to the absence of an index when using all scalar values. This suggests that the initialization of the DataFrame is encountering an issue related to the absence of an index.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be the initial indexing of the values in the `init_ndarray` function. When creating a DataFrame from a 2D ndarray, both index and columns are required parameters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `init_ndarray` is not properly handling the case where indexes are not provided, especially when dealing with scalar values.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to verify that both index and columns are provided before initiating the creation of the DataFrame. If they are not provided, default values should be assigned to them to ensure the initialization can proceed without encountering the error.

Here's the corrected code for the `init_ndarray` function:

```python
def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    # input must be a ndarray, list, Series, index

    if index is None:
        index = RangeIndex(start=0, stop=values.shape[0], step=1)

    if columns is None:
        columns = [0]  # Assuming a default column value here

    # ... Remaining code remains unchanged ...
```
