The problem with the function seems to be related to how the 'columns' are assigned. In both test cases, the 'columns' variable should be assigned a list with a single element, either 0 or the name of the column. However, in the current implementation, 'columns' is being determined from the input values without considering the dtype or the input provided. This results in 'columns' containing multiple values when it should only have a single value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that 'columns' only contains a single value based on the input and dtype. We can achieve this by checking the dtype and conditionally assigning the 'columns' variable based on the dtype of the input.

Here is the corrected code for the 'init_ndarray' function:

```python
def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    # input must be a ndarray, list, Series, index

    # existing code ...

    if is_categorical_dtype(getattr(values, "dtype", None)) or is_categorical_dtype(dtype):
        # existing code ...

        index, columns = _get_axes(len(values), 1, index, columns)
        
        # Modify columns to contain a single value
        if isinstance(columns, list):
            columns = columns[0]
        
        return arrays_to_mgr([values], columns, index, columns, dtype=dtype)

    # rest of the code...
```

With this correction, the 'columns' variable is always assigned a single value, ensuring that it behaves as expected in the subsequent parts of the function. This should resolve the issue related to 'columns' containing multiple values.
