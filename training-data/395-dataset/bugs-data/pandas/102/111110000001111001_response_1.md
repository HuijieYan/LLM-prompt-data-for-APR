Upon analyzing the given buggy function, it appears that the bug occurs when the input values ndarray's dtype is datetime64[ns, UTC] and dtype is not None. This specific case is not handled correctly in the buggy function.

The buggy function fails to handle the case of an input array with dtype datetime64[ns, UTC] when the dtype is not None. This results in an incorrect assignment to the columns variable.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case where the input values ndarray's dtype is datetime64[ns, UTC] and the dtype is not None. It should assign the columns variable with value [0] in this specific case.

The corrected code for the problematic function should be as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    # other parts of the function remain unchanged
    
    if dtype is not None and values.dtype == np.dtype('<M8[ns]'):
        columns = [0]

    return create_block_manager_from_blocks([values], [columns, index])
```
