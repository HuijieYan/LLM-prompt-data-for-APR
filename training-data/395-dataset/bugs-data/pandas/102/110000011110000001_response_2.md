The error message indicates that when calling `pd.DataFrame(array_dim2, dtype="datetime64[ns, UTC]")`, the function `init_ndarray` is failing due to a ValueError related to not passing an index.

The potential error location within the `init_ndarray` function is likely in the `arrays_to_mgr` call. The `index` parameter is not being appropriately handled, leading to the ValueError.

The bug occurs because the code is not handling the index parameter correctly. It should be checking if the index is None and not processing like it is currently doing.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if the index is None, and if so, assign it a default index.

Here's the corrected code for the `init_ndarray` function:

```python
def init_ndarray(values, index, columns, dtype=None, copy=False):
    # input must be a ndarray, list, Series, index
    if index is None:
        index = np.arange(len(values))

    # rest of the function's code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By setting a default index if `index` is None, we can avoid the ValueError caused by not passing an index, as seen in the error message.
