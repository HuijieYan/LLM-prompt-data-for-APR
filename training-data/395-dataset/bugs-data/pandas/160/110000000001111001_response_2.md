Based on the provided test cases and the buggy function, it seems the function is designed to determine whether to use the `numexpr` library for certain operations based on the input parameters. However, the function contains several issues. 

The key issue is that the function doesn't actually use the input parameters `op` and `op_str` to make a decision. This contradicts the function's purpose, as it should be based on the operation type and not just the data types.

Additionally, the function seems to check for the compatibility of data types, but it does so in a complex and somewhat unclear way. It also doesn't compare the data types of `a` and `b` correctly.

To fix the issue, the function should consider the operation type (`op_str`) and use it to make a decision about whether to use `numexpr`. It should also compare the data types of `a` and `b` more effectively.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

_MIN_ELEMENTS = 1000  # Assuming this is a suitable minimum threshold

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:  # Required minimum elements
            if isinstance(a, np.ndarray) and isinstance(b, np.ndarray):
                # check for dtype compatibility
                if a.dtype == b.dtype:  # Compare the data types of a and b
                    return True
    return False
```

This corrected function takes into account the operation type and properly checks the data types of `a` and `b` before making the decision on whether to use `numexpr`.
