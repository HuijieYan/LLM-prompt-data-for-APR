The error is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function within the pandas library. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised when the function attempts to call the `value_counts` method on the `dtypes` attribute of the input data. This suggests that the `dtypes` attribute may not have a `value_counts` method, leading to the AttributeError.

The bug seems to have occurred due to a change in behavior between different versions of pandas. In the older version (0.19.2), the `get_dtype_counts()` method was used to inspect if the dtype is uniform in the object. However, in the newer version, this method has been deprecated, and the code has been updated to use `dtypes` instead, leading to the occurrence of the error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic within the `_can_use_numexpr` function to handle the `dtypes` attribute more gracefully. One approach could be to check if the `dtypes` attribute is a Pandas Series or DataFrame, and based on that, decide whether to use the `value_counts` method or not.

Here is the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    # Check if the dtypes attribute is a Series or DataFrame
                    if isinstance(o.dtypes, pd.Series):
                        s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    elif isinstance(o.dtypes, pd.DataFrame):
                        s = o.dtypes.apply(lambda x: str(x)).value_counts()
                    else:
                        return False  # Return False if dtypes is neither Series nor DataFrame
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str)
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `dtypes` attribute is a Pandas Series or DataFrame. If it's a Series, we can directly call `value_counts`. If it's a DataFrame, we apply a lambda function to handle each column and then call `value_counts` on the result. Otherwise, we return False if the `dtypes` is neither a Series nor a DataFrame.
