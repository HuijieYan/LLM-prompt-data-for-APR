The issue is occurring due to the usage of the `value_counts()` method to check for dtype compatibility with the objects `a` and `b`. This method is causing the AttributeError as it is called on a numpy dtype which does not have a `value_counts()` method.

To fix this bug, the `value_counts()` method should be replaced with `get_dtype_counts()` as it is available in the older pandas version (prior to 0.25) and is also backward compatible beyond pandas 0.25.

The corrected code for the function `_can_use_numexpr` is as follows:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, 'get_dtype_counts'):
                    s = o.get_dtype_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

By implementing the change mentioned above, the code will be able to handle DataFrame and Series operations on large datasets without crashing and returning `AttributeError`.
