The error occurs in the `_can_use_numexpr` function because of the attribute error `AttributeError: 'numpy.dtype' object has no attribute 'value_counts'`. This error is raised because the function is expecting to find a 'value_counts' attribute when accessing the 'dtypes' of the input, but it's trying to access it directly from a numpy dtype object, which doesn't have the 'value_counts' attribute.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the case where 'o' is a numpy dtype object separately to avoid trying to access the 'value_counts' attribute on it. Instead, it should directly consider the dtype name in the set of dtypes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes if isinstance(o, pd.Series) else pd.Series(o).dtypes
                    dtypes.add(s if isinstance(s, str) else s.name)
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes.add(o.dtype.name)

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In the corrected code, when checking for dtype compatibility, the function now correctly handles the case when 'o' is a numpy dtype object to avoid the AttributeError. Additionally, the dtype name is added directly to the set of dtypes, which eliminates the need to access the 'value_counts' attribute.
