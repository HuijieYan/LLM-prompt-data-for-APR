The given function `_can_use_numexpr` seems to have a bug because of the way it checks for the compatibility of data types between the input arrays. The bug is causing the function to return False even when the data types are compatible.

The bug occurs because of the comparison operator being used to check if the set of data types calculated for the input arrays is a subset of the allowed data types. The code has logic to check if the set of data types is a subset of the allowed data types, but it uses the greater than or equal to comparison operator, which is not the correct way to check for a subset.

To fix this bug, the correct approach is to use the `issubset` method of sets in Python to check if the set of data types calculated for the input arrays is a subset of the allowed data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str)
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not dtypes or dtypes.issubset(_ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check]):
                return True

    return False
```

In this corrected code, the `issubset` method is used in the line `if not dtypes or dtypes.issubset(_ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check]):` to check if `dtypes` is a subset of `_ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check]`. This should fix the bug and correctly check for data type compatibility.
