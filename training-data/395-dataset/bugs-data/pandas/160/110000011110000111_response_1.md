The _can_use_numexpr function is used to determine whether the numexpr library can be used for a given operation. The error occurs due to a change in how dtype compatibility is checked, specifically on the line `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()`. This line causes an AttributeError in the _can_use_numexpr function when checking for dtype compatibility in the newer version of pandas (after 0.19.2).

The reason for the AttributeError is that the dtype attribute of numpy.ndarray and pandas.Series returns a single numpy dtype, hence it does not have a value_counts() method. Therefore, the code is trying to call value_counts() on a numpy dtype, resulting in the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to change the way dtype compatibility is checked. Instead of calling value_counts() on the dtype, we should use other methods available to check compatibility. One possible approach is to use the numpy functions to compare the dtypes of the given arrays.

Here's the corrected _can_use_numexpr function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            a_dtype = a if hasattr(a, 'dtype') else a[0].dtype
            b_dtype = b if hasattr(b, 'dtype') else b[0].dtype
            # allowed are a superset
            if np.can_cast(a_dtype, b_dtype) or np.can_cast(b_dtype, a_dtype):
                return True
    return False
```

In the corrected function, we use np.can_cast() to check for dtype compatibility. This ensures that the comparison is based on the compatibility of the dtypes, rather than trying to call value_counts() on the dtype, which caused the AttributeError.
