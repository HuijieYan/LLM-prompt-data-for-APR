The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.dtype' object has no attribute 'value_counts'` occurs because the code is trying to call the `value_counts` method on a NumPy dtype object, which does not exist. This happens because the code is using the `value_counts` method to inspect if the dtype is uniform in the object, which was supported in pandas 0.19.2 but in later versions has been deprecated in favor of `get_dtype_counts` method.

To fix this, we can use the `get_dtype_counts` method instead of `value_counts` to check for dtype compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes.get_dtype_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
