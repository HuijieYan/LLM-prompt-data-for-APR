The issue here seems to stem from the use of the `value_counts()` method on the `dtypes` attribute. This method tries to count the occurrences of unique values within the `dtypes` object, which is a NumPy dtype object, and as such, it does not have a `value_counts()` method.

In the older version of pandas (0.19.2), the `get_dtype_counts()` method was used, which provided the functionality required for checking the dtype compatibility. However, this method has been deprecated in newer versions, leading to the regression.

To fix this issue, one approach could be to handle the dtype compatibility check without relying on a deprecated method or invalid method calls.

Here's a corrected version of the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes") and isinstance(o, pd.DataFrame):
                    dtypes |= set(o.dtypes)
                elif isinstance(o, pd.Series):
                    dtypes |= set([o.dtype])
                else:
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype}

        if not dtypes or all(dtype_check == dt for dt in dtypes):
            return True

    return False
```

In this corrected version, we directly use the `dtypes` attribute of DataFrames and the `dtype` attribute of Series to gather the dtype information, and then perform the compatibility check based on these dtypes.

This approach avoids the use of deprecated methods and removes the reliance on the `value_counts()` method, thereby correcting the bug.
