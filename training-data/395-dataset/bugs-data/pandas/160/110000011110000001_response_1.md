The error in the code occurs within the `_can_use_numexpr` function. The error is due to the statement `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()` where `o.dtypes` is assumed to have a method `value_counts`, but it does not.

The reason behind this bug is that `o.dtypes` is a property that returns a single dtype for Series or DataFrame. It does not have a method called `value_counts`. This code seems to be trying to determine if there are multiple dtypes in the input. 

To fix this bug, we need to rewrite the dtype compatibility check logic. We can modify the logic to account for the datatype of the input values and handle the check differently for Series and DataFrames.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    # For DataFrame
                    if isinstance(o, pd.DataFrame):
                        dtypes |= set(o.dtypes)
                    # For Series
                    elif isinstance(o, pd.Series):
                        dtypes.add(o.dtype)
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes.add(o.dtype)

            dtype_check_set = set([dtype_check])
            # Ensure that the dtype_check is a subset of the dtypes
            if dtype_check_set.issubset(dtypes):
                return True

    return False
```

In the corrected code:
1. We check if `o` is a DataFrame or a Series. If it's a DataFrame, we add all the dtypes to the set `dtypes`, and if it's a Series, we add the dtype to the set.
2. We then compare the set of allowed dtypes (`dtype_check_set`) with the set of actual dtypes (`dtypes`) to ensure that the `dtype_check` is a subset of the dtypes.

These changes will address the bug and provide the correct logic for checking dtype compatibility.
