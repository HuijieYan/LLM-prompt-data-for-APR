The issue is occurring because the `_can_use_numexpr` method is checking for dtype compatibility. This method is used to assess whether to use the numexpr library for computation. In the current version, this compatibility check is leading to a failure due to a change in the behavior of the `dtype` attribute between pandas 0.19.2 and 0.25.

In pandas 0.19.2, the method uses the `get_dtype_counts()` method to inspect if the dtype is uniform in the object. However, the `get_dtype_counts()` method is deprecated in the latest version.

To fix this issue, the `_can_use_numexpr` method needs to be updated to use an appropriate method to determine dtype compatibility based on the changes between the versions of pandas.

Here's the corrected `_can_use_numexpr` method:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """Return a boolean indicating whether to use numexpr."""
    if op_str is not None:
        # Required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # Check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "get_dtype_counts"):
                    s = o.get_dtype_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # Allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True
    return False
```

By using the `get_dtype_counts()` method, this corrected version of the method matches the behavior of pandas 0.19.2 while accommodating the changes in pandas 0.25 and later. This should resolve the issue related to numexpr compatibility and the AttributeError with 'numpy.dtype' object has no attribute 'value_counts'.
