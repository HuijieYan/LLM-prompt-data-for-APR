The issue seems to be occurring within the `_can_use_numexpr` function, specifically the following code block:

```python
if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
```

The issue stems from the fact that the `dtypes` attribute of the object `o` is a `numpy.dtype` object, and it does not have the `value_counts` method. This leads to an `AttributeError` when the method is called on the `numpy.dtype` object.

The reason behind this bug is that the original code expects `o.dtypes` to be a pandas Series representing the data types for each column, allowing for the `value_counts` method. However, in the case of a `numpy.ndarray` or `pandas.Series` of dtype objects, this is not the case, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the `numpy.dtype` object differently. We will replace the `value_counts` method with a check to ensure that there is only a single dtype in the object, indicating uniform dtype compatibility.

Here's the corrected code for the `can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes
                    if hasattr(s, 'value_counts'):
                        if len(s.value_counts()) > 1:
                            return False
                        dtype = s.dtype.name
                        dtypes |= {dtype}
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtype = o.dtype.name
                    dtypes |= {dtype}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In this modified code, we handle the `numpy.dtype` object separately to account for the lack of `value_counts` method. We check for the presence of `dtype` directly and then use the dtype name to ensure uniformity in dtype compatibility. This should resolve the AttributeError and allow the function to work correctly with both pandas Series and numpy arrays.
