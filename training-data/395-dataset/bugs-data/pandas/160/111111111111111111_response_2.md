The problem lies within the `_can_use_numexpr` function as it checks for dtype compatibility using the `value_counts()` method, which is not available for NumPy dtype objects.

The bug occurs because the `value_counts()` method doesn't work for NumPy dtype objects, and it was not properly handled in the `_can_use_numexpr` function.

The potential fix for this bug is to use a different method for checking dtype compatibility, one that is compatible with both Pandas and NumPy dtype objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            if hasattr(a, "dtype") and hasattr(b, "dtype"):  # Check if objects have a dtype attribute
                dtypes = {str(a.dtype), str(b.dtype)}  # Convert dtype to str for comparison
                if len(dtypes) == 1:  # Only one dtype is allowed for compatibility
                    return True
    return False
```

This correction ensures that the `dtype` attribute is checked for compatibility before proceeding, and it correctly handles the dtype comparison for Pandas and NumPy dtype objects.
