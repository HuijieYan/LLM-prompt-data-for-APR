The issue is related to the `_can_use_numexpr` function which is used to determine if the numexpr library should be used for certain combinations of operations between DataFrames and Series. The bug occurs when the function tries to check for dtype compatibility using `o.dtypes.value_counts()` which results in an AttributeError because the `numpy.dtype` object does not have an attribute named `value_counts`.

To fix the bug, the validation for dtype compatibility should be modified to check for the availability of `dtypes.value_counts()` method before attempting to use it. Since `value_counts()` provides the count of unique values in the Series, it's likely that the intention of the original code was to ensure that the Series contains a single unique dtype.

The corrected code is as follows:
```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes") and hasattr(o.dtypes, "value_counts"):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed types should be a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

In this corrected code, the `hasattr(o.dtypes, "value_counts")` check ensures that the `value_counts()` method is available before attempting to call it. The other conditions related to dtype compatibility are retained, and the overall logic of the function remains the same.
