The error message indicates that the `DataFrame` and `Series` operations fail on large datasets. The error occurs when the `value_counts()` method is called on a `numpy.dtype` object, which does not have this attribute.

The issue is caused by the fact that the `numpy.dtype` object does not have a `value_counts()` method, which leads to an `AttributeError` when the method is called on it.

To fix this issue, the code must be updated to use alternative approaches for checking dtype compatibility. Additionally, it might be necessary to re-evaluate the conditions for whether to use numexpr or not based on the dtype compatibility check.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    if len(o.dtypes.value_counts()) == 1:  # Changed to use len of value_counts()
                        dtypes |= set(o.dtypes.index.astype(str))
                    else:
                        return False
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```

This corrected code checks for the length of the `value_counts()` to ensure that there is only one dtype in the `dtypes`. If there is more than one dtype, it returns `False`. This approach addresses the issue with calling `value_counts()` on a `numpy.dtype` object and provides a more robust dtype compatibility check.
