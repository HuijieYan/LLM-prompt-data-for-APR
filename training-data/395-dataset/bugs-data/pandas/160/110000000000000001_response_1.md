Potential Error:
The potential error in the given code is the comparison of the set of dtypes with the allowed dtypes using the `>=` operator. This comparison is not valid for sets in Python.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the comparison between the set of dtypes and the allowed dtypes is not being performed correctly. The code is trying to use the `>=` operator to compare sets, which is not a valid operation in Python.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix this bug by correctly comparing the sets of dtypes with the allowed dtypes using the `issubset` method for sets in Python.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()
                    if len(s) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}

            # allowed are a superset
            if not len(dtypes) or dtypes.issubset(_ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check]):
                return True

    return False
