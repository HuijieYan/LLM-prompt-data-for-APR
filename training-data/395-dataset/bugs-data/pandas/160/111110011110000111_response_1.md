The error occurs in the `_can_use_numexpr` method due to the use of the `value_counts` method on the `numpy.dtype` object, which does not have the `value_counts` attribute. This change was introduced in the `pandas` version 0.25, leading to a regression.

The potential fix for this issue is to modify the method to use the `get_dtype_counts` method for older versions of `pandas` and use the `dtypes.value_counts()` approach for newer versions. This would ensure that the method is compatible with both older and newer versions of `pandas`.

Below is the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` method:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:

        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:

            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, 'get_dtype_counts'):
                    s = o.get_dtype_counts()  # For pandas version earlier than 0.25
                else:
                    s = o.dtypes.value_counts()  # For pandas version 0.25 and later
                
                if len(s) > 1:
                    return False
                dtypes |= set(s.index.astype(str)

            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True

    return False
```
