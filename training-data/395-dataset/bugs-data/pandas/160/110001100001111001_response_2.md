The given function `_can_use_numexpr` is meant to return a boolean depending on whether the numexpr library can be used for computation. The function checks for the number of elements in the input array, the compatibility of data types, and whether the operation is allowed for the given data types.

The potential bug in the function is with the comparison of data types and allowed data types for the operation. The comparison logic for data types seems to be incorrect, and there is an issue with handling floating point precision for comparisons.

The corrected function would involve refining the logic for checking data type compatibility and allowed data types for the operation. Additionally, handling floating point precision issues is necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
import numpy as np

_MIN_ELEMENTS = 1000  # Minimum number of elements for numexpr usage

_ALLOWED_DTYPES = {
    'evaluate': {'float64'},  # Allowed data types for the 'evaluate' operation
    'other_operation': {'int64', 'float64'}  # Allowed data types for other operations
}

def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """Return a boolean indicating whether numexpr can be used"""
    if op_str is not None:
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes_a = a.dtypes if hasattr(a, "dtypes") else {a.dtype.name}
            dtypes_b = b.dtypes if hasattr(b, "dtypes") else {b.dtype.name}
            if len(dtypes_a) == 1 and len(dtypes_b) == 1:  # Only one data type allowed for each array
                if dtype_check in _ALLOWED_DTYPES and dtypes_a | dtypes_b <= _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check]:
                    return True
    return False
```

In the corrected function:
- We have defined the allowed data types for each operation in the `_ALLOWED_DTYPES` dictionary.
- The function now checks if only one data type is present in each array and compares it with the allowed data types for the operation.
- The use of `|` operator instead of `<=` for the comparison of data types ensures that all types are considered for compatibility.
- We have also defined the minimum number of elements required for using numexpr as `_MIN_ELEMENTS`.

This corrected function handles the data type compatibility and allowed data types for the operation more effectively, addressing the issues present in the original function.
