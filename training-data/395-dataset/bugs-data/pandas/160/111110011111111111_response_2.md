The issue appears to be related to changes in how dtypes are handled in the `pandas` library, specifically within the `_can_use_numexpr` function. In earlier versions of `pandas` (before 0.19.2), the function utilized `get_dtype_counts()` to inspect if the dtype was uniform in the object. However, in later versions (from at least 0.25), the use of `get_dtype_counts()` was deprecated, and a different approach was implemented which resulted in the AttributeError.

The AttributeError occurs because it is trying to use a method `value_counts()` on a `numpy.dtype` object, which doesn't have that method.

To fix this bug, the function `_can_use_numexpr` should be modified to handle dtype compatibility appropriately. A check to ensure `o` is a DataFrame or a Series should be added, and the logic for checking dtype compatibility should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# this is the fixed function
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if isinstance(o, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
                    dtype = o.dtypes if isinstance(o, pd.DataFrame) else o.dtype
                    if isinstance(dtype, pd.DatetimeTZDtype):
                        # This requires 'evaluate' dtype
                        dtype = pd.np.dtype('datetime64[ns]')
                    dtypes |= {dtype}
            if not dtypes or all(_ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check].dtype in dtypes for _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] in _ALLOWED_DTYPES):
                return True
    return False
```

This corrected function now checks the compatibility of dtypes for both DataFrames and Series, making use of `isinstance` to verify that `o` is a DataFrame or a Series. Instead of using `value_counts()`, it simply adds the dtype to a set and checks for compatibility with the `_ALLOWED_DTYPES` criteria. This should prevent the AttributeError and improve dtype compatibility checking.
