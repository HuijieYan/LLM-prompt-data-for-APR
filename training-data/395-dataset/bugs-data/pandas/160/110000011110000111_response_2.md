The error is occurring in the `_can_use_numexpr` function of the `expressions.py` file. The issue seems to be with the `s = o.dtypes.value_counts()` line, which is failing due to an AttributeError. This is likely happening because the `dtypes` attribute of the Series doesn't have the `value_counts()` method.

The bug occurred due to changes in the pandas library between versions 0.19.2 and 0.25, where the implementation of the `_can_use_numexpr` function was altered. This led to the use of the `value_counts()` method on the `dtypes` attribute of the Series, which doesn't exist.

A possible solution for fixing the bug is to use an alternative method to determine if the dtypes are uniform across the objects. This can be achieved by checking the length of unique dtypes instead of using the `value_counts()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_can_use_numexpr` function:

```python
def _can_use_numexpr(op, op_str, a, b, dtype_check):
    """ return a boolean if we WILL be using numexpr """
    if op_str is not None:
        # required min elements (otherwise we are adding overhead)
        if np.prod(a.shape) > _MIN_ELEMENTS:
            # check for dtype compatibility
            dtypes = set()
            for o in [a, b]:
                if hasattr(o, "dtypes"):
                    unique_dtypes = o.dtypes.unique()
                    if len(unique_dtypes) > 1:
                        return False
                    dtypes |= set(unique_dtypes.astype(str))
                elif isinstance(o, np.ndarray):
                    dtypes |= {o.dtype.name}
            if not len(dtypes) or _ALLOWED_DTYPES[dtype_check] >= dtypes:
                return True
    return False
```

In the corrected code, we are using the `unique()` method to get the unique dtypes and checking the length of the unique dtypes to ensure dtype uniformity.
