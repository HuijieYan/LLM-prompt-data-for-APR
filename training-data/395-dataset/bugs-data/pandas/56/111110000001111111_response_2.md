The provided code is a method that is part of a DataFrame class in the pandas library. The method is used to quickly retrieve a single value at a specific column and index. The code contains a conditional statement where if the 'takeable' parameter is true, it retrieves the item using '_iget_item_cache', else it retrieves the item using '_get_item_cache'. There are also try-except blocks to handle KeyError and a condition to handle partial indexing if the index has multiple levels.

The error occurs because the method is infinitely recursive in some cases due to the condition:
```python
return self._get_value(index, col, takeable=True)
```
This condition calls the same method again but with the 'takeable' parameter set to True, creating an infinite loop.

To fix this, the function should be modified to eliminate the recursive call. One way to achieve this is by rearranging the code to handle takeable and non-takeable cases separately and avoiding the recursive call.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    if not isinstance(index, (int, np.integer)):
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
    else:
        loc = index

    return series._values[loc]
```

This corrected code separates the logic for 'takeable' and 'non-takeable' cases, avoiding the need for a recursive call altogether.
