Error Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `assert` statement is failing because it is comparing a `Timestamp` object to a `datetime.datetime` object, which are not equal.

Potential Error Location:
The `_get_value` method is likely the source of the bug, particularly the `com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])` line within the `takeable` condition.

Reasons for the Bug:
The `com.maybe_box_datetimelike` function is intended to wrap a datetime-like object into a `Timestamp` object. However, in this case, it seems that it is wrapping the datetime-like object into a `Timestamp` object, which is causing the assertion to fail.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the usage of `com.maybe_box_datetimelike` to ensure that it is working as expected.
2. Consider using `pd.Timestamp` to explicitly convert the datetime-like object into a `Timestamp` object instead of relying on `com.maybe_box_datetimelike`.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index] if not isinstance(series._values[index], Timestamp) else series._values[index]

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
    except KeyError:
        # GH 20629
        if self.index.nlevels > 1:
            # partial indexing forbidden
            raise

    # we cannot handle direct indexing
    # use positional
    col = self.columns.get_loc(col)
    index = self.index.get_loc(index)
    return self._get_value(index, col, takeable=True)
```
In the corrected code, instead of using `com.maybe_box_datetimelike`, the `Timestamp` object is explicitly checked using `isinstance`. If the object is already a `Timestamp`, it is returned as is; otherwise, it is returned from the series.
