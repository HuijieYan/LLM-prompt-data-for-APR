The error message is asserting that a Timestamp object is equal to a datetime.datetime object, which is causing the test case to fail.

The potential error in the problematic function is the use of the `com.maybe_box_datetimelike` function, which is causing the type mismatch between Timestamp and datetime.datetime objects.

The bug occurred because the `_get_value` function is using the `com.maybe_box_datetimelike` function to retrieve a single value, which is wrapping the value in a Timestamp object. This behavior is not desired for the given test case, leading to the failure.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `com.maybe_box_datetimelike` function call and directly retrieve the value from the series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_value` function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index]

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
    except KeyError:
        # GH 20629
        if self.index.nlevels > 1:
            # partial indexing forbidden
            raise

    # we cannot handle direct indexing
    # use positional
    col = self.columns.get_loc(col)
    index = self.index.get_loc(index)
    return self._get_value(index, col, takeable=True)
```

With this correction, the function should no longer wrap the retrieved single value in a Timestamp object, which should resolve the type mismatch issue encountered in the test case.
