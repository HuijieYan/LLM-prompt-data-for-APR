The error occurs in the function `_get_value` where the expected return type of the result is not matching with the actual type. The function should return a `datetime` object, but it returns a `Timestamp` object instead.

Looking at the code, the issue is likely due to the method `com.maybe_box_datetimelike` being applied to the series values. This method would convert the values to a `Timestamp` object, but in this case, it should not be doing so. 

The bug occurs in the if-else block where `takeable` is False. When `takeable` is False, the else block should be executed, but currently, it recursively calls `_get_value` with `takeable=True`. This is incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we should remove the recursive call to `_get_value` and directly return the value from `series._values[loc]`. Additionally, the `maybe_box_datetimelike` method should not be applied in this case, as the datatype conversion is not necessary.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index]
    else:
        series = self._get_item_cache(col)
        engine = self.index._engine

        try:
            loc = engine.get_loc(index)
            return series._values[loc]
        except KeyError:
            # GH 20629
            if self.index.nlevels > 1:
                # partial indexing forbidden
                raise
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly return the expected type of `datetime`.
