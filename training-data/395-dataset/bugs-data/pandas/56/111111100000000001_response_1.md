The potential error in the code is that the `_get_value` function is calling itself recursively without reaching a base case, which may result in infinite recursion and a stack overflow error.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic of the function so that it doesn't call itself recursively. We can also handle the case where the index or column is not found in the DataFrame by returning a default value or raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_value` function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"Index '{index}' not found")

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"Column '{col}' not found")

    return None  # or raise an error if needed
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the recursive call and added error handling to raise a KeyError when the index or column is not found. We have also added a default return value in case the index and column are found.
