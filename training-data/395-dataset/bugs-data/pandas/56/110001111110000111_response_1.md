The bug is likely occurring in the `_get_value` method of the DataFrame class. This method is used internally by functions like `at`, `iat`, `loc`, and `iloc`. The bug seems to be causing a mismatch between a Timestamp object and a datetime object, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The reason for this bug may be due to improper handling of object types when the method `_get_value` is called. It seems that the method is not correctly preserving the types of the values it retrieves, leading to the mismatch and assertion error.

To fix this bug, the `_get_value` method should ensure that it returns the correct type of object. Additionally, the method should be modified to appropriately handle datetime and timedelta objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_value` method:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index]

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    loc = engine.get_loc(index)
    return series._values[loc]
```

In this corrected code, the method has been simplified to only retrieve the value from the series and return it. It does not involve any unnecessary conversions, which should prevent the type mismatch issues.
