The issue with the buggy function `_get_value` seems to be related to the use of `self._get_item_cache` and `self._iget_item_cache`. These methods are not defined within the provided class, but they are used in the `_get_value` function. It seems that the correct methods to be used are `self._getitem_cache` and `self._getitem_at`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the incorrect or undefined method names are being used within the `_get_value` function, which is leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `_get_value` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._getitem_at(index))

    series = self._getitem_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._getitem_at(loc)
    except KeyError:
        # GH 20629
        if self.index.nlevels > 1:
            # partial indexing forbidden
            raise

    # we cannot handle direct indexing
    # use positional
    col = self.columns.get_loc(col)
    index = self.index.get_loc(index)
    return self._get_value(index, col, takeable=True)
```

In the corrected code, the method calls have been changed to use `self._iget_item_cache` and `self._getitem_cache` instead of the undefined methods. This should resolve the issue and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
