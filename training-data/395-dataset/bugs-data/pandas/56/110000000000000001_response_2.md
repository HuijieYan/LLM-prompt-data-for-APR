Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the recursive call to `_get_value` at the end of the function.

Reason for the bug: The bug seems to be caused by the recursive call to `_get_value` at the end of the function. This recursive call is made without any terminal condition, which could lead to infinite recursion and a stack overflow error.

Approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to remove the recursive call and replace it with a loop that iterates until the `takeable` condition is no longer met.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    while takeable:
        if takeable:
            series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
            return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])
        else:
            series = self._get_item_cache(col)
            engine = self.index._engine

            try:
                loc = engine.get_loc(index)
                return series._values[loc]
            except KeyError:
                # GH 20629
                if self.index.nlevels > 1:
                    # partial indexing forbidden
                    raise

            # we cannot handle direct indexing
            # use positional
            col = self.columns.get_loc(col)
            index = self.index.get_loc(index)
            takeable = True
```
