Potential error location: The potential error location is within the `try` block where it tries to get the location of the index using `engine.get_loc(index)`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may occur when the index isn't found in the engine, leading to a KeyError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can handle the KeyError by checking if the index exists in the engine. If not, we can return None or handle the exception in a different way.

Corrected code:
```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
    except KeyError:
        # Handle the exception by returning None or another value
        return None
```
