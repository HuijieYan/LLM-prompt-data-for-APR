The `test_iat_dont_wrap_object_datetimelike` function generates an AssertionError when asserting that a `Timestamp('2016-01-01 00:00:00')` is equal to `datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 1, 0, 0)`. This suggests that the `.iat` calls are returning unexpected types when compared to the expected types.

Upon analysis of the provided code, the potential error location is within the `_get_value` method of the DataFrame class. This method is called when using `.iat` to get a scalar value from a DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the `_get_value` method is incorrectly handling object types, specifically datetime and timedelta types. It should not call `com.maybe_box_datetimelike` for these types, but it seems to be doing so, leading to the unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_get_value` method should be modified to correctly handle datetime and timedelta types, ensuring that the correct types are returned without unnecessary processing.

The corrected code for the `_get_value` method is as follows:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index]

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
    except KeyError:
        # GH 20629
        if self.index.nlevels > 1:
            # partial indexing forbidden
            raise

    # we cannot handle direct indexing
    # use positional
    col = self.columns.get_loc(col)
    index = self.index.get_loc(index)
    return self._get_value(index, col, takeable=True)
```

In this corrected `_get_value` method, unnecessary processing of datetime and timedelta types has been removed, and the correct raw values are returned directly. This should resolve the issue with unexpected types being returned from `.iat` calls.
