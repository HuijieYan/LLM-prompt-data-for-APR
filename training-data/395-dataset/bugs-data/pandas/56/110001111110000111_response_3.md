The test case is asserting that a Timestamp object is equal to a datetime.datetime object, which is causing the AssertionError. This indicates that the _get_value function is not returning the expected Timestamp object.

The potential error location within the _get_value function is the line `return com.maybe_box_datetimelike(series._values[index])`. This line is supposed to return a Timestamp object, but it seems to be returning a datetime.datetime object instead.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the com.maybe_box_datetimelike() function is not properly handling the conversion of the series._values[index] into a Timestamp object.

To fix the bug, the com.maybe_box_datetimelike() function should be replaced with the appropriate method for converting series._values[index] into a Timestamp object. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the correct object type is being returned from the _get_value function.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_value function:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index]

    series = self._get_item_cache(col)
    engine = self.index._engine

    try:
        loc = engine.get_loc(index)
        return series._values[loc]
    except KeyError:
        # GH 20629
        if self.index.nlevels > 1:
            # partial indexing forbidden
            raise

    # we cannot handle direct indexing
    # use positional
    col = self.columns.get_loc(col)
    index = self.index.get_loc(index)
    return self._get_value(index, col, takeable=True)
```
