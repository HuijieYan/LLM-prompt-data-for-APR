The error message suggests that the `df.iat[0, 0]` call should return a `datetime.datetime` object, but it returns a `Timestamp` object instead, which causes the assertion error.

The problematic function is the `_get_value` method in the `DataFrame` class. The bug seems to be related to how datetime objects are handled when `takeable` is set to `True`. The function is not correctly differentiating between a `datetime` object and a `Timestamp` object.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling datetime objects correctly when `takeable` is set to `True`. This causes the function to return a `Timestamp` object instead of a `datetime` object, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `_get_value` method to properly handle the conversion of datetime objects to `Timestamp` objects based on the value of the `takeable` parameter.

Here's the corrected `_get_value` method:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if not takeable:
        series = self._get_item_cache(col)
        engine = self.index._engine

        try:
            loc = engine.get_loc(index)
            return series._values[loc]
        except KeyError:
            if self.index.nlevels > 1:
                raise
    else:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        return series._values[index]
```

In the corrected method, we handle the `takeable` parameter differently and correctly return the datetime object when `takeable` is `True`. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect return value and the assertion error in the test case.
