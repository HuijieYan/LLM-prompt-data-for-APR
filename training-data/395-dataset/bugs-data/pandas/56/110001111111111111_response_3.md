Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies within the `_get_value` method of the DataFrame class. The function seems to have issues handling the datetimelike objects, leading to failed assertions in the test function.

The bug occurs because the `_get_value` function is not properly handling the datetimelike objects. The method is intended to quickly retrieve single values at a specified column and index, but it is not functioning correctly when dealing with datetimelike objects. This results in a failed assertion in the test function.

To fix the bug, the `_get_value` method should be modified to properly handle datetimelike objects. This can be achieved by ensuring that the function correctly identifies the type of the input and processes datetimelike objects appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_value` method:

```python
def _get_value(self, index, col, takeable: bool = False):
    """
    Quickly retrieve single value at passed column and index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index : row label
    col : column label
    takeable : interpret the index/col as indexers, default False

    Returns
    -------
    scalar
    """
    if takeable:
        series = self._iget_item_cache(col)
        value = series._values[index]
        if isinstance(value, (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
            return value.item()
        else:
            return value
    else:
        series = self._get_item_cache(col)
        engine = self.index._engine
        try:
            loc = engine.get_loc(index)
            value = series._values[loc]
            if isinstance(value, (np.datetime64, np.timedelta64)):
                return value.item()
            else:
                return value
        except KeyError:
            if self.index.nlevels > 1:
                raise
        col = self.columns.get_loc(col)
        index = self.index.get_loc(index)
        return self._get_value(index, col, takeable=True)
```

In this corrected code, we have added checks to ensure that when `takeable` is True, the method correctly handles datetimelike objects in the series. Similarly, when `takeable` is False, the method also properly handles these objects. The `item` method is utilized to convert datetimelike objects to their corresponding native Python types.
