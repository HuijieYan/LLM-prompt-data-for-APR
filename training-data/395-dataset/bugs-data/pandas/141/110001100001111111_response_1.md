The bug occurs when dealing with decreasing RangeIndex that is not in its canonical form. The code incorrectly assumes that self.stop is the canonical form when calculating the reversed range. This leads to incorrect indexers being returned by the get_indexer method, causing issues with methods like Series.reindex.

To fix the bug, the values for start, stop, and step when dealing with a decreasing RangeIndex should be taken from the reversed underlying range object, rather than computing the reversed values directly.

Here's the corrected code for the get_indexer method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    reverse = self._range[::-1]
    start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With this correction, the get_indexer method should now work properly for all RangeIndex cases, including decreasing RangeIndex that are not in their canonical form.
