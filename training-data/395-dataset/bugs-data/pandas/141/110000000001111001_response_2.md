The bug seems to be occurring in the calculation of the `start` and `stop` values within the `if self.step > 0` block. The code erroneously subtracts `self.step` from `self.start` and `self.stop`, which is causing issues with the subsequent calculations.

The reason behind the bug is likely a miscalculation or incorrect handling of negative steps in the range. When the step is negative, the start and stop values may become inverted and cause unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle negative steps correctly. One approach could be to use the absolute values of `self.start` and `self.stop` when calculating the `start` and `stop` values within the `if self.step > 0` block. This would prevent issues related to negative steps.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    if step < 0:
        start, stop = stop, start  # Swap start and stop for negative step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code properly handles negative steps in the range and should address the bug that was identified.
