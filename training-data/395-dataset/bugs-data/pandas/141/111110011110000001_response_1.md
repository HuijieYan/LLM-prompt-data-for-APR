The error message indicates that the expected and actual results are different for the `test_get_indexer_decreasing` test case, with the maximum difference percentage being 55.55556%.

Upon inspecting the code, the potential error may lie in the calculation of the `target_array` which is used to ensure the input `target` is of integer data type and one-dimensional. If the input `target` does not meet these criteria, the general method for `get_indexer` is called.
The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logical conditions to address non-integer data type and multidimensional array cases are incorrectly defined and implemented.
A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logical conditions for checking the data type and dimension of `target` appropriately and ensure proper branching of the code based on the results of these checks.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not np.issubdtype(target_array.dtype, np.integer) or target_array.ndim != 1:
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
