The error message is indicating that the `test_get_indexer_decreasing` function is failing due to the differences between the expected and actual results. The test data is creating a RangeIndex with a stop value of 0, -1, and -2 and then calling the `get_indexer` method with a range of 9. The expected result is `np.array([-1, 2, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 0, -1])`.

The bug in the code is located in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The bug occurs due to the incorrect calculation of the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values when `self.step` is less than or equal to 0.

The bug is happening because the code that calculates `start`, `stop`, and `step` when `self.step` is less than or equal to 0 is incorrect. The current code tries to calculate these values by swapping `start` and `stop` and changing the sign of `step`. However, this is not an accurate way to reverse the range and causes the calculation to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly reverse the range. This can be done by swapping `start` and `stop` and changing the sign of `step`. Additionally, the code for transforming original locs when the step is not equal to self.step also needs to be updated to reflect the correct reversals.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `get_indexer` method for the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Correctly reverse the range by swapping start and stop and changing the sign of step
            start, stop, step = self.stop - 1, self.start - 1, -self.step

        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step  # Use integer division instead of floating point division

        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = (len(self) - 1) - locs[valid]  # Correctly transform to original locs
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
