The test case `test_get_indexer_decreasing` is intended to test the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. It constructs a `RangeIndex` object with start, stop, and step values, and then calls the `get_indexer` method with a range of numbers as the input parameter. The expected result is compared with the actual result using `tm.assert_numpy_array_equal`.

Looking at the error message, it seems there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual results. Specifically, the values in the resulting array are different from the expected values, leading to an assertion error.

Upon inspecting the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class, it appears that the calculation of the result may not be correct. Due to a conditional branch that depends on the value of `step`, the calculation may result in unexpected indexing and thus misalignment of values in the resulting array.

The bug is caused by the mishandling of the step value in the indexing logic. When `self.step` is less than 0, the calculation to determine the start, stop, and step values does not produce the correct output for indexing the target array. This leads to incorrect results and the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditional indexing logic based on the `step` value and ensure that the start, stop, and step values are correctly calculated for both positive and negative step values.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method in the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
# this is the corrected get_indexer function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step

    if step < 0:
        # Handling negative step value
        start, stop, step = stop + 1, start - 1, -step
        
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    locs = (target_array - start) // step
    
    if step < 0:
        # Reversing the range if step is negative
        locs = len(self) - 1 - locs
        
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
