The test case `test_get_indexer_decreasing` is testing the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class with a decreasing range. The `RangeIndex` is created with a stop value (`stop`) of 0 and a step value of -3. When the method is called with a range of 9, the result is compared with an expected array. However, the comparison fails, indicating that the method is returning incorrect values for the given range.

The bug likely exists in the logic of `get_indexer` method, specifically in the calculations related to the reversed range. It seems that the calculation of `start`, `stop`, and `step` for the reversed range is causing the incorrect output.

The reason behind this bug is that the calculation of `start`, `stop`, and `step` for the reversed range is not correctly capturing the values for the given decreasing range. Due to this, the method is returning incorrect indexes for the input range.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for computing the reversed range in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. Instead of directly computing the reversed values within the method, we should retrieve the values from the reversed underlying range object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Retrieve values from the reversed underlying range object
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
