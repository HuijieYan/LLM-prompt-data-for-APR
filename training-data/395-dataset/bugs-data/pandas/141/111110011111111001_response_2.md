The problematic function is `get_indexer` in the `RangeIndex` class. The issue arises from the logic that handles reversing the range when the step is negative. The function seems to be overly complex and may contain incorrect logic for reversing the range.

The potential cause of the bug is that when the step is negative, the logic for reversing the range is not correctly handling the start and stop values.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the range reversal logic correctly computes the start and stop values and uses them to index the target array.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop + self.step, self.start - 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = (target_array - start) // step
    valid = (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = (len(self) - 1 - locs[valid])

    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected code, the logic to compute the start, stop, and step values when the step is negative has been updated. Additionally, the computation of `locs` and `valid` has been improved to correctly handle the reversed range.

These changes should address the issues related to the handling of negative step values in `get_indexer` and ensure that the function correctly computes the index values for the given target array.
