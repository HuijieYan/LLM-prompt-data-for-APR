The error occurs when the test case `test_get_indexer_decreasing` is executed, and the `tm.assert_numpy_array_equal` method fails to assert that the `result` and `expected` values are equal.

The bug is likely located in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class, specifically in the logic that handles the computation when `self.step <= 0`. This logic seems to incorrectly handle the reversed ranges, which leads to the wrong result in the test case.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling the reversed range assumes that `self.stop` is the canonical form, which is not always the case. This leads to incorrect computation when `step` is less than or equal to 0.

To fix the bug, we should directly compute the reversed values from the underlying range object instead of relying on `self.stop` as the canonical form.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

By modifying the logic for handling reversed ranges, we can ensure that the `get_indexer` method correctly computes the indices for the target values against the `RangeIndex`. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass successfully.
