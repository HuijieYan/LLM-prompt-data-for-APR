The `test_get_indexer_decreasing` function is testing the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The error message shows that the values returned by the `get_indexer` method for the given inputs are different from the expected values.

Upon analyzing the `get_indexer` method, it appears that the method is incorrectly handling the calculation of indices when the step size is negative. This could lead to the incorrect calculation of the indices, resulting in differences between the expected and actual values returned by the method.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to adjust the logic for calculating the indices when the step size is negative. The calculation of the indices needs to be modified to ensure that the correct indices are returned in all cases.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
# corrected get_indexer method
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )
    
    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step

    # Calculate the indices based on the step size
    if step > 0:
        locs = (target - start) // step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity
        locs = (stop - target - 1) // -step
    
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

In the corrected code, the calculation of the indices has been adjusted to ensure that the correct indices are returned for both positive and negative step sizes. This should address the bug in the original `get_indexer` method.
