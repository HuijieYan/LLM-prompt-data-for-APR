The issue here seems to be with the calculation of the `start` and `stop` values within the function `get_indexer`. The implementation appears to be incorrect, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

The input parameter `self` represents a RangeIndex with a decreasing step value. The `start` and `stop` for the RangeIndex are provided, and then the function `get_indexer` is called to calculate the indexers for a given target range.

Upon analyzing the expected variable values in the test cases, it seems that the calculations for `start`, `stop`, and `step` are incorrect within the function. Additionally, the computation of the `reverse` variable is not in line with the expected results.

To fix the bug:
1. Recalculate the values for `start`, `stop`, and `step` based on the given RangeIndex values.
2. Adjust the logic to compute `reverse` to ensure it aligns with the requirements for handling a RangeIndex with a negative step.
3. Verify that the calculation of `locs` and `valid` is based on accurate and corrected computations of `start`, `stop`, and `step`.

Below is the corrected function `get_indexer`:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        new_start, new_stop, new_step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        new_start, new_stop, new_step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - new_start
    valid = (locs % new_step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < new_stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / new_step

    if new_step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With these corrections, the calculations for `start`, `stop`, and `step` should yield the expected results, and the test cases should pass without errors.
