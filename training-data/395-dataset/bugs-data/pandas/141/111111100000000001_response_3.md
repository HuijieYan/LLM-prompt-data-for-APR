The potential error in the problematic function is the use of the 'super()' keyword without providing the correct parent class. This could result in unexpected behavior as it might not call the intended method from the parent class.

The 'super()' keyword is used to call the method in the parent class, but it requires the class name as an argument. This is missing in the provided code, causing potential issues.

To fix the bug, the corrected code should explicitly specify the parent class name when calling the method using 'super()'. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the correct method is called from the parent class to avoid unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super(RangeIndex, self).get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super(RangeIndex, self).get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
