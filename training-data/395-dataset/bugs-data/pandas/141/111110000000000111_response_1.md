The error seems to be occurring in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. The bug is causing incorrect indexing for some decreasing `RangeIndex` instances.

The potential error location is identified in the lines:
```python
if self.step > 0:
    start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
else:
    # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
    start, stop, step = (self.stop - self.step, self.start + 1, -self.step)
```
In the case where `self.step` is less than or equal to 0, the calculation of `start`, `stop`, and `step` seems to be inaccurate, leading to the incorrect indexing behavior.

The bug occurs because the code for determining start, stop, and step when dealing with decreasing `RangeIndex` instances assumes that `self.stop` is in the canonical form. However, for decreasing range indices, the canonical form needs to be determined differently.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to take the values from the reversed underlying range object when dealing with a decreasing `RangeIndex`. This can be achieved by modifying the code to allow it to handle decreasing indexes correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
