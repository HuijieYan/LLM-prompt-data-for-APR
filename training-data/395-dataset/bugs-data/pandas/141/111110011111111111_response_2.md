The bug in the `RangeIndex.get_indexer` function is causing incorrect results for some decreasing RangeIndex instances. The function is not handling the decreasing RangeIndex in their non-canonical form properly, leading to incorrect indexer values being returned. This bug is impacting methods like `Series.reindex`, making them work improperly.

The root cause of the issue is in the computation of `start`, `stop`, and `step` values when dealing with decreasing RangeIndex. The current implementation assumes that `self.stop` is in the canonical form, which is not always the case for decreasing RangeIndex instances.

To fix this bug, I suggest taking the values directly from the reversed underlying range object instead of directly computing the reversed values. By doing this, we ensure that the values are accurately derived from the reversed range object.

Here's the corrected code for the `RangeIndex.get_indexer` function:

```python
# ... omitted code ...

def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With this correction, the `RangeIndex.get_indexer` function will accurately handle decreasing RangeIndex instances and return the correct indexer values, resolving the issue observed in the test case and the associated error messages.
