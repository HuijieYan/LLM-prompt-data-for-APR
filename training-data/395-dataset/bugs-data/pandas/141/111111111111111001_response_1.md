The error in the problematic function is likely related to how the RangeIndex class handles reversed ranges, as indicated by the error message indicating differences between the expected and actual outputs.

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect assignment of values to the variables start, stop, and step. In addition, the code contains some redundancies and unnecessary complexity.

To fix the bug, the start, stop, and step values need to be reassigned correctly for the reversed ranges. The logic behind processing the reversed range also needs to be modified to ensure the correct indexing of the target array.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )
    
    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        start, stop, step = self.stop + 1, self.start - 1, -self.step
    
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    locs = (target_array - start) // step
    valid = (locs >= 0) & (locs < len(self))
    locs[~valid] = -1
    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return locs
```

The corrected function accounts for the reversed ranges and adjusts the start, stop, and step values accordingly. This should resolve the issues and ensure correct indexing of the target array.
