The error is caused by the RangeIndex `get_indexer` method for some decreasing RangeIndex. When running the `test_get_indexer_decreasing` test with stop values of 0, -1, and -2, the resulting index values are not as expected, leading to an assertion error. The error message provides the incorrect and expected values, indicating that the `get_indexer` method is not working as intended.

The potential error location is identified in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class where the start, stop, and step values are calculated. The bug is occurring due to incorrect calculation of these values, especially when the step is negative.

The bug occurs because when the step is negative, the start, stop, and step values are not correctly derived, leading to incorrect indexing and unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the start, stop, and step should be calculated based on the reversed underlying range object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    reverse = self._range[::-1]
    start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With the corrected code, the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class should now work correctly, and the `test_get_indexer_decreasing` test should pass without any assertion errors.
