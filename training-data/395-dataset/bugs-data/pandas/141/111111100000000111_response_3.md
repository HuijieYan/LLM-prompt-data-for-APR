Explanation:

The error is occurring in the get_indexer method of the RangeIndex class. Specifically, when the step is greater than 0, the start, stop, and step values are being incorrectly assigned.

The reason for the bug is that the code assumes that self.stop is the canonical form when dealing with decreasing RangeIndex. However, this is not always the case, resulting in the incorrect handling of decreasing RangeIndex.

To fix the bug, we should take the values from the reversed underlying range object when working with a decreasing RangeIndex.

Here is the corrected code for the get_indexer method:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Use the values from the reversed underlying range object
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With this corrected implementation, the get_indexer method should handle both increasing and decreasing RangeIndex correctly.
