The error message mentions that the `get_indexer` method is producing incorrect results for some decreasing RangeIndex. The test case provides an example that clearly shows the issue.

The potential error location within the `get_indexer` method is the logic for handling a decreasing step. When the step is greater than 0, it correctly handles the start, stop, and step variables. However, when the step is less than or equal to 0, it tries to work on the reversed range for simplicity, but this logic is flawed.

The bug occurs because the logic for determining start, stop, and step when dealing with a decreasing RangeIndex in the `get_indexer` method assumes that `self.stop` is the canonical form. This assumption leads to incorrect calculations when the RangeIndex is not in its canonical form.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for determining the start, stop, and step when dealing with a decreasing RangeIndex. Instead of directly computing the reversed values within the function, we should take the values from the reversed underlying range object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    reverse = self._range[::-1]
    start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to the general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to the original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With this correction, the bug in the `get_indexer` method for some decreasing RangeIndex should be resolved.
