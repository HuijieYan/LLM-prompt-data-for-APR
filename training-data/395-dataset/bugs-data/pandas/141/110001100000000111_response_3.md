The test cases indicate that for some decreasing RangeIndex, the get_indexer method is indicating that all of its own values are missing and finding matches for values not included in the index. This is causing issues with methods like Series.reindex not working properly.

The bug is likely located in the part of the code where the start, stop, and step values are determined in the get_indexer method. The code currently assumes that self.stop is the canonical form for determining the start, stop, and step values, but this assumption is incorrect for some decreasing RangeIndex.

The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the reversed RangeIndex. When the step is larger than 1, the uniqueness of representation is lost with stop, causing issues with determining the start, stop, and step values for the reversed RangeIndex. 

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to take the values from the reversed underlying range object instead of directly computing the reversed values ourselves.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    # Work on reversed range for simplicity:
    reverse = self[::-1]
    start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```
