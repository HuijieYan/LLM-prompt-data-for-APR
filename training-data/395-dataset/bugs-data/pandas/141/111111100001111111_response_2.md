Potential Error Location:
The bug is in the calculation of the start, stop, and step values when dealing with a decreasing RangeIndex in the get_indexer method. The code assumes that self.stop is in the canonical form, causing issues when the RangeIndex is not in its canonical form.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code to determine start, stop, and step values when dealing with a decreasing RangeIndex assumes that self.stop is the canonical form. This assumption causes incorrect calculations when the RangeIndex is not in its canonical form.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the code should directly compute the reversed values by taking the values from the reversed underlying range object instead of making assumptions based on the canonical form of the RangeIndex.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected get_indexer function
@appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to the general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] // step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
