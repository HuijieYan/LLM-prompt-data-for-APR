Upon analyzing the provided buggy function and the test cases, it appears that the issue lies in the logic used to handle the reversed range for decreasing RangeIndex in the `get_indexer` method. 

The bug is occurring because the code incorrectly assumes that `self.stop` is the canonical form, which is not always the case for decreasing RangeIndex. This causes incorrect computation of the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values when the RangeIndex is reversed.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic in the `get_indexer` method to directly compute the reversed values from the underlying range object, rather than assuming `self.stop` as the canonical form.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
# this is the corrected get_indexer function
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

    reverse = self._range[::-1]
    start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step
    
    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]

    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

With this correction, the `get_indexer` method should now handle the reversed range for decreasing RangeIndex correctly, resolving the issue as described in the GitHub title and description.
