The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class when the index is in decreasing order and not in its canonical form. This causes the method to incorrectly compute the start, stop, and step values, leading to incorrect indexer values.

The cause of the issue is that the code to determine start, stop, and step when dealing with a decreasing RangeIndex assumes that `self.stop` is in the canonical form. This assumption is incorrect, leading to the bug.

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to directly compute the reversed values from the reversed underlying range object, rather than making assumptions about the canonical form.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function:

```python
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
            return super().get_indexer(
                target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
            )
    
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step
        
        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)
    
        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step
    
        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code directly computes the `start`, `stop`, and `step` values from the reversed underlying range object, ensuring that the method works correctly for all cases, including decreasing RangeIndex that are not in their canonical form.
