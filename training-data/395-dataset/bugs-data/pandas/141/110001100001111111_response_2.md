The bug occurs in the `get_indexer` method of the `RangeIndex` class. When dealing with a decreasing `RangeIndex` that is not in its canonical form, the method incorrectly computes the start, stop, and step values, causing it to return incorrect indices and leading to unexpected behavior in methods like `Series.reindex`.

The bug occurs because the code in the `get_indexer` method assumes that `self.stop` is the canonical form, leading to incorrect calculations for start, stop, and step when the `RangeIndex` is in a non-canonical form.

To fix the bug, the method should retrieve the start, stop, and step values directly from the reversed underlying range object, rather than indirectly computing the reversed values. This change will ensure that the method handles both canonical and non-canonical forms of `RangeIndex` correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
    if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
        return super().get_indexer(
            target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit
        )

    if self.step > 0:
        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
    else:
        # Retrieve start, stop, and step from the reversed underlying range object
        reverse = self._range[::-1]
        start, stop, step = reverse.start, reverse.stop, reverse.step

    target_array = np.asarray(target)
    if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
        # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to general method
        return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

    locs = target_array - start
    valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
    locs[~valid] = -1
    locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

    if step != self.step:
        # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
        locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
    return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

This corrected code retrieves the start, stop, and step values from the reversed underlying range object when the `RangeIndex` is in a non-canonical form, ensuring that the `get_indexer` method handles both canonical and non-canonical forms correctly.
