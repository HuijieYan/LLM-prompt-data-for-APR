The error is occurring in the `test_get_indexer_decreasing` test case. The values that are being asserted are different. This test case is for investigating the behavior of the `get_indexer` method when the `stop` parameter is less than `start`. The function is experiencing an issue when the step size is negative.

The issue is likely due to the logic inside the `get_indexer` method, particularly when the step size is negative. When `self.step` is less than 0, the logic for indexing and adjusting the values is not functioning as expected, resulting in incorrect indexing of the elements.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `get_indexer` method needs to be updated to properly handle negative step sizes.

```python
    def get_indexer(self, target, method=None, limit=None, tolerance=None):
        if com.any_not_none(method, tolerance, limit) or not is_list_like(target):
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance, limit=limit)

        start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step

        if self.step > 0:
            start, stop, step = self.start, self.stop, self.step
        else:
            # Adjust the start, stop, and step for negative step size
            start, stop, step = (self.stop - 1, self.start - 1, -self.step)

        target_array = np.asarray(target)
        if not (is_integer_dtype(target_array) and target_array.ndim == 1):
            # checks/conversions/roundings are delegated to the general method
            return super().get_indexer(target, method=method, tolerance=tolerance)

        locs = target_array - start
        valid = (locs % step == 0) & (locs >= 0) & (target_array < stop)
        locs[~valid] = -1
        locs[valid] = locs[valid] / step

        if step != self.step:
            # We reversed this range: transform to original locs
            locs[valid] = len(self) - 1 - locs[valid]
        return ensure_platform_int(locs)
```

The modified part of the method now handles negative step sizes and adjusts the start, stop, and step accordingly. This should address the issue with negative step sizes and incorrect indexing, allowing the test case to pass.
