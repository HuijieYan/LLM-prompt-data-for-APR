The test case `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` is trying to write a DataFrame `df1` to a new GCS Parquet file using the `to_parquet` method. It sets the engine to "fastparquet" and compression to None. The error occurs during the execution of this test case.

The potential error location is within the implementation of the `write` function in the `FastParquetImpl` class. Specifically, the issue might be related to the handling of GCS file paths and the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to open the GCS file in read mode ("rb") instead of write mode ("wb"). This causes a `FileNotFoundError` to be raised.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the GCS file is opened in write mode and that the correct file path is used.

Here's the corrected implementation for the problematic function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code:
- We ensure that the GCS file is opened in "wb" mode if it's an S3 URL.
- We also ensure that the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is called with the correct mode.
