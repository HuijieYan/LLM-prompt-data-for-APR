The test case `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` is trying to write a DataFrame to a GCS Parquet file using the `to_parquet` method, specifying the `engine` as "fastparquet" and `compression` as `None`. This test case is expected to create a new Parquet file on GCS.

The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is being raised in the `MockGCSFileSystem` class when trying to open a file in write mode.

The potential error location within the `write` function of the `FastParquetImpl` class is the condition for handling s3 URLs. When the code checks if the path is an s3 URL, it opens the s3file in 'wb' mode, but it is not properly handling the GCS scenario.

The bug occurs because the code is using `is_s3_url(path)` to identify if the path is an s3 URL, and this logic is not handling GCS URLs, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file in write mode.

To fix the bug, the code needs to correctly identify GCS URLs and open the file in write mode for GCS.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if path.startswith("gs://"):
        # Handle GCS file open for write mode
        with file_open(path, mode="wb") as f:
            # And pass the opened file to the fastparquet internal impl.
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: f
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for GCS URLs using `path.startswith("gs://")` and used the `file_open` method to open the file in write mode for GCS. This should fix the issue of `FileNotFoundError` while writing to GCS Parquet files.
