The error message is indicating a `FileNotFoundError`. This typically occurs when the file being accessed does not exist.

The issue seems to be related to the file path in the `df1.to_parquet` function call within the test. It is trying to write to a Parquet file at path `"gs://test/test.csv"`. However, the actual file being opened in the test is `test.parquet`.

The potential error location is in the `write` function of the `FastParquetImpl` class. Specifically, the issue could be related to the handling of the file path and mode.

The bug occurred because the `write` function seems to be expecting a Parquet file path, but the test is providing a CSV file path. Additionally, the function may not be handling the scenario where the file does not exist or needs to be created.

To fix the bug, the file path and mode handling in the `write` function should be modified accordingly to support creating a new Parquet file if it does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3 file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        
        if not file_exists(path):
            create_file(path)
        
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3 file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        if not file_exists(path):
            create_file(path)
        
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)
    
    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
In this corrected code, we're adding checks to see if the file exists and create it if it doesn't before opening it in write mode. This should avoid the `FileNotFoundError` issue.
