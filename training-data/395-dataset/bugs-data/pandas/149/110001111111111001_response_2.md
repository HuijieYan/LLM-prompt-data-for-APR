The error occurs when the `df1.to_parquet` method is called in the test function `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file`. The error message indicates a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file with mode 'w'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the file path and open operation when writing the Parquet file.

The bug occurs because the function `write` is not handling the file path properly when trying to open the file with mode 'w'.

To fix the bug, the file path needs to be properly handled to create a new Parquet file if it doesn't exist. Additionally, the open operation should use mode 'wb' (for writing binary data).

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        # Handle the file path and open the file in 'wb' mode if it doesn't exist
        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            try:
                with open(path, 'rb') as file:
                    # File exists - append to existing Parquet file
                    existing_df = fastparquet.ParquetFile(file).to_pandas()
                    df = existing_df.append(df, ignore_index=True)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                # File doesn't exist - create and write the Parquet file
                with open(path, 'wb') as file:
                    # Write the Parquet file
                    fastparquet.write(file, df, compression=compression, write_index=index, partition_on=partition_cols, **kwargs)
```

By handling the file path and open operation properly, the corrected function should address the issue encountered in the test function.
