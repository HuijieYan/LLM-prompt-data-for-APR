The error message indicates that the code is trying to open a file in mode 'rb', but it should be opening it in write mode ('wb'). The issue seems to be within the "get_filepath_or_buffer" function, specifically in the "pandas/io/gcs.py" file.

The bug is occurring because the code is attempting to open the file in read mode, but it should be opening the file in write mode because it is trying to create a new file.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the file is opened in the correct mode, depending on whether the file already exists or we are creating a new file. Additionally, the handling of s3 file paths could also be corrected.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode for writing.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")  # open in 'wb' mode for writing

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

By opening the file in 'wb' mode when necessary, depending on the file path and whether it's a new file being created, the bug should be resolved.
