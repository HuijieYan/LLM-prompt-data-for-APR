The error occurs when the `df1.to_parquet` function is called in the test case `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file`. The error message indicates that there is a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the specified path in write mode.

The potential error location within the `write` function is the handling of the file path when using GCS. It seems that the function is unable to open the file for writing on GCS, which leads to the `FileNotFoundError` in the test case.

The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly trying to open the file using GCS file system but is unable to do so, leading to the `FileNotFoundError`.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to correctly handle the file path when using GCS, ensuring that it can be opened for writing. Additionally, any potential issues with opening the file in write mode need to be addressed. 

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        if kwargs:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported keyword arguments when writing to S3")
        fastparquet.write(path, df, compression=compression)
    else:
        fastparquet.write(path, df, compression=compression, write_index=index, partition_on=partition_cols, **kwargs)
``` 

Note: This corrected code assumes that the `fastparquet` package is used for writing to Parquet files. If a different package or method is used, the code would need to be adjusted accordingly.
