Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring within the conditional statement that checks if "partition_on" is in the kwargs dictionary and if partition_cols is not None.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
1. The conditional statement is checking for "partition_on" in the kwargs dictionary, but then it is trying to pop "partition_on" from the kwargs dictionary. This can cause a conflict if "partition_on" is in kwargs and partition_cols is not None.
2. Additionally, there is a conditional statement to set the "file_scheme" key in the kwargs dictionary when partition_cols is not None, but this statement is not properly aligned with the correct logic.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Consider revising the conditional statements to handle the "partition_on" and partition_cols logic in a more consistent manner. It might involve re-evaluating the conditions to avoid any conflicts when popping "partition_on" from kwargs and setting "file_scheme" based on partition_cols.
2. Ensure that conditional statements and the operations within them align with the correct logic flow to avoid any unexpected conflicts.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def write(
        self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
    ):
        self.validate_dataframe(df)

        if "partition_on" in kwargs:
            if partition_cols is not None:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Cannot use both partition_on and "
                    "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
                    "partitioning data"
                )
            partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

        if partition_cols is not None:
            kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

        if is_s3_url(path):
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
        else:
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            self.api.write(
                path,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_cols=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
