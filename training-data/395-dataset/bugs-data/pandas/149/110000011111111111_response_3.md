The error occurs when the `df1.to_parquet` method is called inside the `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` test function. This method ultimately calls the `write` method of the `fastparquet` engine. The error seems to be originating from the way the `path` is handled within the `write` method.

The bug occurs because the `write` method has an incorrect handling of the `path` variable, especially when dealing with S3 URLs and the `open_with` lambda function.

To fix the bug, the `write` method needs to properly handle the `path` variable, specifically when dealing with different file schemes like 'file' or 'hive', and whether it is an S3 URL or not.

Additionally, the `open_with` lambda function needs to be properly defined to handle the opening of S3 files.

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        import s3fs
        s3 = s3fs.S3FileSystem()
        with s3.open(path, 'wb') as f:
            pass  # Do nothing, just to validate if path is proper.
        kwargs["open_with"] = s3.open
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

By following these steps and making the necessary corrections, the bug in the `write` method of the `fastparquet` engine should be fixed.
