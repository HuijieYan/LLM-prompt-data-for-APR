The error occurs when trying to write a DataFrame to a Parquet file using the `to_parquet` method, specifically when the file path points to a location in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

The problem lies in the way the function handles the file paths for GCS. When the file path points to an existing file, it should be opened in read mode (mode='r'), but the current implementation always tries to open the file in write mode ('w'), causing a FileNotFoundError to be raised.

To fix the bug, the function `write` needs to handle GCS file paths correctly and open the file with the appropriate mode based on whether the file already exists or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` method:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        if "gcs" in path:
            # GCS file paths should be handled differently based on whether the file exists or not
            fs = gcs.get_fs_from_file_path(path)
            if fs.exists(path):
                # If the file exists, open in read mode
                path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="rb")
            else:
                # If the file doesn't exist yet, open in write mode
                path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        else:
            # For non-GCS file paths, simply get the file path or buffer
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the GCS file path is explicitly checked for using the substring "gcs". If the substring is found, the function uses GCS-specific methods to verify the existence of the file and to determine the mode in which the file should be opened.
