This bug occurs when the `to_parquet` method is called on a DataFrame to write it to a GCS Parquet file. The error message indicates that the file is trying to be opened in 'rb' mode, which suggests that there is an issue with the file opening operation.

The problematic part of the code seems to be related to the handling of GCS paths within the `write` function. The error message indicates that the file is trying to be opened in 'rb' mode, which suggests that there is an issue with the file opening operation.

The bug occurs because the FastParquetImpl's `write` method attempts to open a file in 'rb' mode instead of 'wb' mode when the destination file is on GCS. This leads to a `FileNotFoundError` as it is trying to open the file for reading, which does not exist yet.

To fix the bug, the `open` operation should be modified to use 'wb' mode when the path is on GCS. Additionally, an `if-else` condition can be added to handle both regular and GCS paths.

Here's the updated code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if path.lower().startswith('gs://'):
        mode = 'wb'  # Opening file in 'wb' mode for GCS
    else:
        mode = 'w'
    
    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        with get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode) as f:
            self.api.write(
                f,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
```

In this updated code, the `open` call has been replaced with `get_filepath_or_buffer` to handle file opening operations. The `mode` variable is determined based on whether the path is on GCS or not, and the file is opened accordingly. This should fix the bug and prevent the `FileNotFoundError` from occurring.
