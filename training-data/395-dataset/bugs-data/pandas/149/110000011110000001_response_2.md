The error occurs when trying to write a Parquet file to a not-yet-existent GCS (Google Cloud Storage) location. The test case is using a mock object for `GCSFileSystem` and trying to write to "gs://test/test.csv" with "fastparquet" engine and no compression.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the interaction with GCS file system and the handling of file path or buffer.

The bug occurs in the `write()` function of the Parquet file writer. It fails to handle the GCS (Google Cloud Storage) path properly and does not create a new file at the specified location if it does not exist.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle write operations to GCS properly, creating a new file if it does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `write()` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="ab")  # Use append mode for S3
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")  # Use write mode for other file systems

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `get_filepath_or_buffer()` function now uses "ab" mode for S3 URLs (append mode) and "wb" mode for other file systems (write mode). This change ensures that the Parquet file is created if it does not exist, and the data is written to it accordingly.
