The error occurs due to the use of the `catch_warnings` function without an import statement for it. The `catch_warnings` function is used to capture and record warnings that occur during the execution of a specific block of code.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `catch_warnings` function from the `warnings` module. We also need to handle the potential deprecation warning mentioned in the code.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import warnings

def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
        warnings.simplefilter("always")  # set to record all warnings
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
        for warning in w:
            if issubclass(warning.category, DeprecationWarning):
                print(warning.message)
```

In the corrected code:
- We have imported the `warnings` module and used `warnings.catch_warnings` to capture the potential deprecation warning.
- We also set `warnings.simplefilter("always")` to record all warnings.
- We added a loop to iterate through the recorded warnings and print the message if it's a `DeprecationWarning`.

These changes should address the potential warning related to the deprecation of the `tostring()` function and properly handle any other warnings that might occur during the execution of the `write` function.
