The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `is_s3_url` function, which is not defined in the provided code. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_s3_url` function is being used but is not defined in the provided code. This is likely causing the function to fail.

To fix the bug, you can either define the `is_s3_url` function within the provided code or replace the usage of `is_s3_url` with an equivalent function that checks if the path is an S3 URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with the `is_s3_url` function replaced by a hypothetical `check_s3_url` function:

```python
# corrected function
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"
    
    if check_s3_url(path):  # Replace is_s3_url with check_s3_url
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `is_s3_url` function has been replaced by a hypothetical `check_s3_url` function, and the rest of the code remains unchanged.
