The error message indicates that a FileNotFoundError is being raised when attempting to open a file in write mode in the `MockGCSFileSystem` class within the `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` function. This suggests that there may be an issue with the file opening process in the `write` function of the FastParquetImpl class.

The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the handling of the path and mode when opening a file in the `write` function. The FileNotFoundError indicates that the file being accessed does not exist, which could be due to an incorrect file path or mode being used.

To fix this bug, one approach could be to ensure that the correct file path is being used and that the file is being opened in the appropriate mode. Additionally, the `catch_warnings` context manager is used, so it's important to review and handle any warnings that are being caught there.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    # Updated to use correct mode when accessing the file
    if is_s3_url(path):
        if "w" in kwargs.get("mode", "r"):
            mode = "wb"
        else:
            mode = "rb"
        
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode=mode)
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode=kwargs.get("mode", "rb"))

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In this corrected code, the `mode` is directly handled when opening the file based on the provided path and additional mode information passed in the `kwargs`. Additionally, any potential warnings caught in the `catch_warnings` context manager should be reviewed and handled appropriately.
