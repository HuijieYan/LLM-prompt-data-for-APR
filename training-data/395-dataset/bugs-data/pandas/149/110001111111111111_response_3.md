The error occurs in the `write` function when attempting to write a DataFrame to a Parquet file in a GCS (Google Cloud Storage) directory. The error message indicates a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file in write mode.

The code tries to create a file using `open` without specifying the write mode for GCS, which is causing the `FileNotFoundError`. The underlying issue is that the function doesn't handle GCS file paths properly.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle GCS file paths by using the GCSFileSystem's `open` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"
    
    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, fs = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    elif is_gcs_url(path):
        fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem()
        with fs.open(path, 'wb') as f:
            path = f
    else:
        path, _, _, fs = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
``` 

In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to check if the file path is a GCS path. If it is, it uses the `gcsfs.GCSFileSystem` to open the file in write mode and then passes the file object as the `path` parameter, ensuring that the file is created correctly.
