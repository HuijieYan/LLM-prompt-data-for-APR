The error in the function is likely related to the use of `self.api.write`. The `self.api` should be an instance of the `FastParquetImpl` class, which does not have a `write` method.

The potential error location is at the line `self.api.write(...)`.

The reason for the bug is that the `write` method is being called on an object that does not have a `write` method.

To fix this bug, we should use the `fastparquet.write` function instead of `self.api.write`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        fastparquet.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `fastparquet.write` function is used instead of `self.api.write`, avoiding the error related to the missing `write` method on `self.api`.
