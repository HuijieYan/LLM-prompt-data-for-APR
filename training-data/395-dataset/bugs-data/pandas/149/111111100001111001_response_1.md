The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the handling of the `open_with` parameter in the kwargs dictionary and the path variable. The code is attempting to open the path as a s3file in 'wb' mode, and then pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal implementation. 

However, there is an issue with how the path is being handled, as well as the `open_with` lambda function.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Update the code to properly handle the path and open it in 'wb' mode for s3 URLs.
2. Ensure that the `open_with` lambda function has the correct format and implementation for opening files.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        import io
        s3_file = io.BytesIO()
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda f: s3_file
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```
