The error occurs when the `df1.to_parquet` function is called in the `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` test case. The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is raised in the `MockGCSFileSystem` class, which indicates that the file being opened for writing does not exist or cannot be opened for writing.

The source of the bug seems to be in the `write` function where the `path` is being handled. It appears that the function is unable to handle the case where the file does not exist and needs to be created. Additionally, there is an issue with the handling of the `compression` parameter and `open_with` lambda function.

To fix this bug, the `path` should be checked for existence and created if it does not exist. Additionally, the handling of the `compression` parameter and the `open_with` lambda function should be reviewed for possible corrections.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if path.startswith("gs://"):
        # Check if the file exists, and if not, create it
        if not gcs.exists(path):
            gcs.touch(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In this corrected code, I added a check to see if the file exists using `gcs.exists()` and if it doesn't, I create the file with `gcs.touch()`. This should prevent the `FileNotFoundError` from occurring in the `MockGCSFileSystem` class. Additionally, any issues related to the `compression` parameter and the `open_with` lambda function should be checked and resolved if necessary.
