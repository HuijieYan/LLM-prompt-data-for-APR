The error message related to the use of `tostring()` being deprecated is not directly related to the code provided. The potential error in the code is the use of `self.api` to access the `write` method without properly instantiating `FastParquetImpl`. 

The bug occurs because the `FastParquetImpl` object is not properly instantiated, and the `write` method is being called directly on it. Additionally, there is a potential issue with the `is_s3_url` function, as it is not defined in the given code.

To fix this bug, the `FastParquetImpl` object should be properly instantiated before the `write` method is called. Additionally, the `is_s3_url` function should be defined or imported.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import fastparquet

def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    fastparquet_obj = fastparquet.FastParquetImpl()  # Instantiate the FastParquetImpl object
    fastparquet_obj.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):  # Assuming is_s3_url is a user-defined function for checking S3 URLs
        # Handle S3 path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        fastparquet_obj.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In this corrected code, the `FastParquetImpl` object is properly instantiated before calling the `write` method. Additionally, the `is_s3_url` function is assumed to be defined or imported from elsewhere.
