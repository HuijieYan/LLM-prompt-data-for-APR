The error occurs when the `to_parquet` method is called on a DataFrame object. This method internally calls the `write` function, which contains the bug.

The bug in the `write` function is due to the condition:
```python
if is_s3_url(path):
```
This condition is checking if the path is an S3 URL, but the code does not handle other types of URLs. In the test case provided, the path is a GCS (Google Cloud Storage) URL, not an S3 URL, so the `else` block should handle this case.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to handle non-S3 URLs by adding an `else` block to the `if is_s3_url(path)` condition.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'

        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By adding the `else` block, the code will now handle GCS URLs or any other non-S3 URLs, avoiding the FileNotFoundError that occurred in the test case.
