The error occurs when the `to_parquet` function is called on the DataFrame object `df1` within the `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` test function. The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is raised when trying to open the file in read mode, which suggests that the file does not exist.

The potential error location within the `write` function is the block of code that handles the path for an S3 URL. It opens the file in write mode (`"wb"`) but may not create the file if it does not exist. This can cause a `FileNotFoundError` when trying to open the file in read mode later on.

To fix this bug, the code within the `write` function needs to be modified to account for the case where the file does not exist. This may involve creating the file if it does not exist or handling the situation differently based on the file's existence.

Here is the corrected `write` method:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'ab' mode.
        # Support 'ab' and create the file if it does not exist
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="ab")
        # And pass the opened s3file to the fastparquet internal impl.
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `mode` parameter for the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is changed to `"ab"` (append and create) for S3 paths to ensure that the file is created if it does not exist. This should prevent the `FileNotFoundError` when the file is later opened in read mode.
