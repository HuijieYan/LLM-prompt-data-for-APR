After analyzing the error message and the test function, it appears that the bug is within the `write` function of the `FastParquetImpl` class where it fails to handle GCS file paths properly.

The error is raised because the `MockGCSFileSystem` does not support opening a file in write mode, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError` when attempting to open the GCS file path.

The potential reason for this bug is that the code does not handle GCS file paths properly and does not properly interact with the `MockGCSFileSystem` when attempting to open the file.

To fix the bug, the `write` function needs to handle GCS file paths properly and interact with the `MockGCSFileSystem` by opening the file in write mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` function in the `FastParquetImpl` class:

```python
def write(
    self,
    df,
    path,
    compression="snappy",
    index=None,
    partition_cols=None,
    **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if path.startswith("gs://"):  # Check if path is a GCS path
        from gcsfs import GCSFileSystem
        fs = GCSFileSystem()
        with fs.open(path, mode="wb") as file:
            path = file
            self.api.write(
                path,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)
        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            self.api.write(
                path,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
```

The corrected code checks if the `path` is a GCS path and handles it accordingly. When the path is a GCS path, it opens the file in write mode using the GCSFileSystem and passes the opened file to the `fastparquet` internal implementation.
