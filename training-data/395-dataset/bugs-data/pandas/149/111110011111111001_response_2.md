The error message indicates that a "FileNotFoundError" is being raised in the `open` method of the `MockGCSFileSystem` class when the `df1.to_parquet` function is called. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the file path is being handled or opened within the `write` function of the `FastParquetImpl` class.

Upon analyzing the provided code, the error seems to emerge from the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function inside the `write` function of the `FastParquetImpl` class. This function is ultimately calling the `open` method of the `fs` object (file system object) with a mode that does not account for writing to a file.

The potential reason behind this bug is that when opening a file for writing, the mode should be set to "wb" or "w" (write binary or write) to ensure that the file can be written to.

To fix the bug, the file path should be opened with the appropriate mode for writing. Additionally, the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function should be modified to handle file opening more robustly and to account for different file modes.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError("Cannot use both partition_on and partition_cols. Use partition_cols for partitioning data")
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")
        
    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"
        
    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        with open(path, "wb") as s3file:
            kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: s3file
    else:
        with open(path, "wb") as file:
            path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(file)
            
    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected function, we have explicitly opened the file with the "wb" mode for writing. The `get_filepath_or_buffer` function now receives the opened file object and any other parameters required. This should resolve the issue of the FileNotFoundError being raised and allow the function to write to the file as intended.
