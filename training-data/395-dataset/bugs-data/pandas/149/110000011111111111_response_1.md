The error occurs when the `df1.to_parquet` function is called. This function is attempting to write the DataFrame `df1` to a Parquet file located at "gs://test/test.csv" using the "fastparquet" engine. The error message indicates a FileNotFoundError is being raised, which is preventing the function from successfully writing to the specified file location.

The issue is likely related to the `write` function's handling of the path and filesystem when writing to GCS. The `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is involved in obtaining the filepath or buffer based on the provided path, and it appears that an error is occurring with this step.

One potential approach for fixing the bug is to review and adjust the handling of the path, filesystem, and file writing process within the `write` function, ensuring that the correct file writing and open modes are used for GCS. Additionally, any potential issues with path parsing or filesystem access should be addressed.

Given these considerations, here's the corrected code for the `write` function:

```python
import gcsfs

def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)

    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem()
    with fs.open(path, "wb") as f:
        self.api.write(
            f,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code:
- The `gcsfs` library is used to create a GCS file system object.
- The file is opened using the GCS file system's `open` method with the mode set to "wb" (write binary).
- The `self.api.write` is called with the opened file object, ensuring the data is written to the correct path with the appropriate file writing mode for GCS.
