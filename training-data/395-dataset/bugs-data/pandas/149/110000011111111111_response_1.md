The error occurs when trying to open an existing file in "read" mode, which is expected to raise `FileNotFoundError` as the file doesn't exist. The bug is likely in the data type or structure of the path and the way it's handled internally within the `write` function.

The bug appears to be with the path handling and open mode determination when dealing with GCS files. It seems like the path is being incorrectly handled as a local filesystem path, causing the file open to fail.

To fix this, we should ensure that the path is correctly processed as a GCS path, and the correct file open mode is determined based on the situation.

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        # path is s3:// so we need to open the s3file in 'wb' mode.
        # TODO: Support 'ab'
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        from gcsfs import GCSFileSystem
        fs = GCSFileSystem()
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer("gcs://" + path, mode="ab")

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path,
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
