The bug appears to be related to the handling of the `path` variable and the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function. It seems that the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function is returning a file buffer along with the path, and the subsequent code is not handling this case correctly.

The bug occurs because the code assumes that the `get_filepath_or_buffer` function only returns the path, when in fact it also returns a file buffer. This causes the subsequent code to encounter unexpected types and leads to errors.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle the case where `get_filepath_or_buffer` returns a file buffer. The file buffer should be used directly as the `path` argument in the `self.api.write` call.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def write(
    self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs
):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    if "partition_on" in kwargs and partition_cols is not None:
        raise ValueError(
            "Cannot use both partition_on and "
            "partition_cols. Use partition_cols for "
            "partitioning data"
        )
    elif "partition_on" in kwargs:
        partition_cols = kwargs.pop("partition_on")

    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"

    if is_s3_url(path):
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path, mode="wb")
        kwargs["open_with"] = lambda path, _: path
    else:
        path, _, _, _ = get_filepath_or_buffer(path)

    with catch_warnings(record=True):
        self.api.write(
            path if isinstance(path, str) else getattr(path, 'name'),
            df,
            compression=compression,
            write_index=index,
            partition_on=partition_cols,
            **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `path` variable is checked to determine if it's a string or a file buffer, and the appropriate action is taken based on its type. This should handle both cases and prevent the errors that occurred in the buggy code.
