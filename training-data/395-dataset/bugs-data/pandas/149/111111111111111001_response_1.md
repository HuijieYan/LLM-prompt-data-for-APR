The error occurs during the test `test_to_parquet_gcs_new_file` when it attempts to write a DataFrame to a GCS Parquet file. The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is being raised when the `df1.to_parquet()` method is called.

The bug is likely located in the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class, specifically in the way the GCS file system is being handled. The error message indicates that a `FileNotFoundError` is raised during the attempt to open the path with mode "rb".

The reason for the occurrence of the bug could be due to the way the path is being handled and opened for writing in the GCS file system. It appears that the current implementation does not handle the GCS path correctly, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError` being raised during the attempted write operation.

To fix the bug, the GCS path should be handled appropriately in the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class. This may involve using the GCS file system to correctly open the path for writing and ensuring that the file is created if it does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `write` method of the `FastParquetImpl` class:

```python
def write(self, df, path, compression="snappy", index=None, partition_cols=None, **kwargs):
    self.validate_dataframe(df)
    
    if partition_cols is not None:
        kwargs["file_scheme"] = "hive"
        
    if path.startswith('gs://'):
        import gcsfs
        fs = gcsfs.GCSFileSystem()
        with fs.open(path, 'wb') as f:
            self.api.write(
                f,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
    else:
        with catch_warnings(record=True):
            self.api.write(
                path,
                df,
                compression=compression,
                write_index=index,
                partition_on=partition_cols,
                **kwargs
            )
```

In the corrected code, the GCS path is correctly handled using the `gcsfs` library to open the path for writing. This should prevent the `FileNotFoundError` from being raised and allow the DataFrame to be written to the GCS Parquet file.
