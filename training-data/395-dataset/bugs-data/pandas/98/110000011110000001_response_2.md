The test case is trying to create a PeriodIndex using the pd.Index function, specifying the dtype as PeriodDtype("D"). The expected result is a PeriodIndex, but the actual result is an Index object with dtype='object'. This indicates that the pd.Index function is not correctly handling the PeriodDtype.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the section that handles the creation of a PeriodIndex. 

The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the creation of a PeriodIndex with a specified dtype. It is failing to recognize and construct the PeriodIndex as intended.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle the creation of a PeriodIndex with a specified dtype. This may involve updating the logic for handling dtype and construction of the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import PeriodDtype, PeriodIndex

def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":

    # ... (other code)

    if is_period_dtype(data) and not is_object_dtype(dtype):
        return PeriodIndex(data, copy=copy, name=name, dtype=dtype, **kwargs)

    # ... (other code)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of PeriodIndex creation has been updated to properly recognize the dtype and construct the PeriodIndex accordingly. This should address the bug and ensure that the pd.Index function can create a PeriodIndex with the specified dtype as intended.
