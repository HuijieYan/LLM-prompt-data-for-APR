The test case `test_base_constructor_with_period_dtype` aims to create a new Index with specific data and dtype. The expected result is a `PeriodIndex` object with the given dtype. However, the actual result is just an `Index` object with a different dtype.

The issue is likely caused by the behavior of the `__new__` method in the `Index` class, which attempts to infer the appropriate index type based on the input data when creating a new Index object. This inference mechanism is designed to make the index creation process more convenient, but it leads to unexpected behavior in cases where the user explicitly specifies a dtype.

The bug occurs when the `__new__` method infers the index type based on the input data, regardless of the specified dtype. As a result, the user-defined dtype is not enforced, and the returned Index object may have a different dtype than the one specified.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `__new__` method such that it respects the specified dtype when creating a new Index object. This modification would involve handling the dtype parameter explicitly and ensuring that the dtype is enforced during index creation.

Here's the corrected `__new__` method for the `Index` class:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    # Handle user-specified dtype
    if dtype is not None:
        return Index(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name)

    # Inference mechanism for index type based on data
    # ... (existing code for inferring index type based on data)
```

In this corrected method, the user-specified dtype is explicitly handled, and if a dtype is provided, it is enforced when creating the new Index object. This modification ensures that the specified dtype is respected and the returned Index object has the correct dtype.
