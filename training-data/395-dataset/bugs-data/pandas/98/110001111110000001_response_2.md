The test case 'test_base_constructor_with_period_dtype' is trying to create an Index object with dtype set to PeriodDtype and comparing it with an expected PeriodIndex object.

The bug is likely to be in the __new__ method of the Index class. It seems that the implementation does not correctly handle the creation of Index objects with dtype set to PeriodDtype.

The error message indicates that the two objects, 'result' and 'expected', are not equal. The 'result' object is an Index with dtype='object' whereas the 'expected' object is a PeriodIndex with dtype='period[D]'. This suggests that the dtype argument is not being used properly in the __new__ method.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the __new__ method should be modified to correctly handle the creation of Index objects with dtype set to PeriodDtype.

Here's the corrected code for the __new__ method:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":

    if dtype and isinstance(dtype, PeriodDtype):
        return PeriodIndex(data, dtype=dtype, name=name, **kwargs)

    # rest of the code for handling other dtype cases
```

This change ensures that if the dtype is a PeriodDtype, it creates a PeriodIndex object instead of the default Index object.
