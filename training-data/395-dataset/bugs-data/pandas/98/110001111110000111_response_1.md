The error occurred due to the improper inference of the index type from the data provided in the `pd.Index` constructor. The test case expected the result to be a `pd.PeriodIndex` with the specified dtype, but the actual result was a regular `Index` with dtype 'object'.

The issue was likely caused by the function's automatic inference of the index type based on the data provided. This led to the constructor not enforcing the specified dtype, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the function should respect the specified dtype when creating the index. It should not perform automatic inference based on the data provided. Instead, it should use the dtype parameter to determine the index type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
        cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
    ) -> "Index":
    
        if dtype is not None:
            return Index(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
        
        return Index(data, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, the function will use the specified dtype to create the index if it is provided. If no dtype is specified, the function will create a regular `Index` without inferring the index type based on the data. This approach ensures that the constructor enforces the specified dtype for the index.
