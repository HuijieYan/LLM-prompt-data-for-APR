The error is occurring because the `pd.Index` constructor is not enforcing the specified dtype. This results in the output being in a different dtype than the one specified.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that handles the dtype specifications and inference based on the input data.

The bug occurred because the dtype was not being enforced properly when constructing the Index. The function was inferring the dtype from the input data rather than enforcing the specified dtype.

To fix the bug, the dtype specified in the constructor should be enforced for the output Index. Additionally, if dtype is specified as 'object', it should disable all inference and guarantee that the output is an Index instead of a specialized type.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs
) -> "Index":
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    if dtype is not None and dtype != 'object':
        # enforce the specified dtype
        return Index(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
    elif dtype == 'object':  # disable all inference
        return Index(data, dtype=object, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
    else:
        # infer the type based on the input data
        return Index(data, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
```

With this corrected code, the dtype specified in the constructor will be enforced for the output Index, and specifying dtype as 'object' will disable all inference and guarantee that the output is an Index.
