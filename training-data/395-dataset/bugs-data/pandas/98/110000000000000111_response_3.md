The problem with the provided function is that it is responsible for creating an index from the input data. However, there are several inconsistencies and erroneous logic in the code.

The potential error locations in the code are as follows:
1. Incorrect inference of the index type from the data.
2. Inconsistent behavior in handling different types of input data.
3. Lack of proper handling for the specified dtype, leading to incorrect output.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The code has complex conditional logic for inferring the index type from the input data, leading to unpredictable behavior.
2. Handling of specified dtype is not enforced, resulting in the inferred dtype taking precedence.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Consolidate the logic for inferring the index type from the input data to make the behavior more predictable.
2. Implement proper handling for the specified dtype to enforce the desired output type.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)

    # handle specified dtype
    if dtype is not None:
        # enforce the specified dtype
        data = np.asarray(data, dtype=dtype)

    # create the index based on the input data and specified dtype
    return Index(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, **kwargs)
```

In this corrected code:
1. The complex conditional logic for inferring the index type from the input data has been removed to make the behavior more predictable.
2. Proper handling for the specified dtype has been implemented to enforce the desired output type.
