The provided test case "test_base_constructor_with_period_dtype" is attempting to create an Index with dtype as PeriodDtype and values as dates. The expected result is a PeriodIndex with the same dtype and values. However, the test is failing with an assertion error because the actual result is an Index with dtype 'object', which is not the expected PeriodIndex.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the conditional checks for creating different types of indexes based on the dtype and data provided. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the dtype argument when creating a new Index.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the cases where the dtype is a PeriodDtype properly, causing it to default to 'object' dtype instead.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the creation of PeriodIndex when the dtype is a PeriodDtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs
) -> "Index":

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    if dtype is not None and isinstance(dtype, PeriodDtype):
        return PeriodIndex(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name)
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    return cls._simple_new(subarr, name, dtype=dtype, **kwargs)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly create a PeriodIndex when the dtype is a PeriodDtype, as expected by the provided test case.
