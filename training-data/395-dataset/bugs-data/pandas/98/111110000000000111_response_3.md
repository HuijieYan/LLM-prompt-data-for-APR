The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the inference of the output type based on the input data, even when a specific dtype is specified. This behavior is inconsistent with the behavior of the Series constructor, which raises an error when the specified dtype is incompatible with the data.

The bug occurs at multiple points in the function where the input data is used to infer the output type, without properly enforcing the specified dtype. This behavior is not consistent with the behavior of other pandas constructors, such as the Series constructor, which enforces the specified dtype.

To fix the bug, the inference of the output type based on the input data needs to be reevaluated. The specified dtype should be enforced, and any incompatible data should raise an error, similar to the behavior of the Series constructor.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(
    cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
) -> "Index":
    name = maybe_extract_name(name, data, cls)
    
    # enforce specified dtype for the input data
    if data is not None:
        data = np.asarray(data, dtype=dtype)
    
    # create the Index based on the specified dtype
    return Index(data, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, name=name, tupleize_cols=tupleize_cols, **kwargs)
```
