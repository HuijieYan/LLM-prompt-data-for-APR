The bug is likely occurring in the `__new__` method of the `Index` class. This method is responsible for constructing a new instance of the class. The bug seems to be related to the inference of the datatype from the data being passed to the constructor. The problem is that if a dtype is specified, it is not being enforced by the constructor.

To enforce the specified dtype in the constructor, the following approach can be taken:
Instead of inferring the dtype from the data, explicitly check if the dtype is specified. If it is, then coerce the data to that dtype. Additionally, when dtype is set to 'object', the inference should be disabled, and the data should be returned as an object array.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `Index` class:

```python
def __new__(
        cls, data=None, dtype=None, copy=False, name=None, tupleize_cols=True, **kwargs,
    ) -> "Index":

    # Check if dtype is specified and enforce it
    if dtype is not None and not is_object_dtype(dtype):
        data = np.asarray(data, dtype=dtype)

    # If dtype is set to 'object', disable inference and return as object array
    elif dtype == 'object':
        data = np.asarray(data, dtype=object)  # Coerce data to object array

    # Rest of the method remains the same...
    ...
```
With this change, the dtype specified in the constructor will be enforced, and when 'object' is set as the dtype, the inference will be disabled.
