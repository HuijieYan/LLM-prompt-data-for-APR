The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The issue is in the part of the code where the function tries to handle different types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar) and convert them to positional or label-based indexers.

The error message "KeyError: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" indicates that the key is not found in the index when using a list indexer. This inconsistency in behavior is due to how different types of indexers are handled differently. The code is not correctly handling the case where a list indexer is used.

To fix the bug, the code should handle the list indexer case in a way that is consistent with how other types of indexers are handled. This means that using a list indexer should not result in a KeyError, and it should behave similarly to other indexers such as slice, DataFrame, and tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Ensure that non-list indexers are converted to a list
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This way, the function will handle the list indexer correctly and consistently with other indexers. This should resolve the issue of the KeyError when using a list indexer.
