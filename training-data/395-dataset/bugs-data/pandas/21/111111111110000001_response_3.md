The error message indicates that the test function is not raising the expected `KeyError`, which suggests that the `_get_with` function is not working correctly.

The potential error location within the `_get_with` function can be the handling of the `key` variable. It seems that the code is trying to handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, data frames, tuples, or scalar values. The if-else conditions are used to determine the type of key and perform specific operations accordingly.

The bug may have occurred due to incorrect handling of the key variable. For example, when `key` is an instance of a class that is none of the types checked in the conditionals, the function may not be able to properly handle it, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, it is essential to ensure that the `_get_with` function can handle a wider range of input types for the `key` variable. This can be achieved by adding more comprehensive checks for different types of input and providing appropriate handling for each type.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case when key is not a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple
    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        # Convert to a list for consistent handling
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.api.extensions.ExtensionArray)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Check what type of key it is and handle appropriately
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
```

In the corrected code, we have added additional type checks for the `key` variable, explicitly handling different scenarios for each type. We also included a catch-all else statement to raise a TypeError if the key type is not recognized or supported. This should make the function more robust and capable of handling a wider variety of input types.
