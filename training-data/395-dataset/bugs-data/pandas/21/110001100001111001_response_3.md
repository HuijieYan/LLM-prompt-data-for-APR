The code is attempting to access elements in a Series using different types of keys such as list, tuple, ndarray, and Index and perform operations such as slicing, reindexing, and locate based indexing. 

The bug in the code can be identified by the error message and the buggy function's behavior when tested with different input values.

The `TypeError` is likely occurring due to the mishandling of the `key` and the logic to determine its type. When `key` is a list, the logic should handle it appropriately to perform the necessary operations such as `reindex`.

To fix the bug, a comprehensive approach is necessary. The code should be refactored to handle different types of keys (e.g., list, tuple, ndarray, and Index) appropriately. Specifically, when `key` is a list, the function should handle it within the existing logical branches and perform the necessary operation such as `reindex`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected code, when `key` is a list, it now calls the `reindex` method appropriately and handles the list-like key within an existing branch of logic, ensuring proper functionality for different types of keys.
