The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the indexers consistently. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, it raises a KeyError, while other indexers such as array-like indexers or a Pandas Index do not raise an error. This inconsistency is causing the test case to fail.

The potential error location is likely within the conditional blocks that handle different types of indexers, such as `if not is_list_like(key)` and `if isinstance(key, list)`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not treating list indexers the same way as other indexers. It is raising a KeyError when a list indexer is provided, but it should be handling list indexers similarly to other indexers.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should treat list indexers in the same way as other indexers, such as array-like indexers or a Pandas Index. Additionally, it should handle all indexers consistently to avoid raising a KeyError.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    else:
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, we handle list indexers in a similar way as other indexers by converting all indexers to a list and then processing them accordingly. This approach ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and resolves the bug.
