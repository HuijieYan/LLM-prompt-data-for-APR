The bug in the given function lies in the conditional checks for different data types of the 'key' parameter. The function is supposed to handle different types of keys in a Series object, but there are inconsistencies in the logic flow and handling of the different types of keys.

The function is not correctly identifying the type of the 'key' parameter in some of the conditional checks. This is leading to incorrect results and causing the function to return the wrong values.

To fix the bug, we can update the conditional checks and the logic for handling the different types of keys more accurately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we adjust the conditional checks to accurately identify the type of the 'key' parameter and handle it accordingly. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works as expected for different types of keys.
