The bug is occurring in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The error message states that the `KeyError` is not being raised when using a list as an indexer for the `ser` Series. This inconsistency is mentioned in the GitHub issue description as well.

The bug occurs because when a list is used as an indexer, the code in the `_get_with` function is not correctly handling this case, leading to the `KeyError` not being raised.

To fix the bug, the code in the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to handle the case where a list is used as an indexer for the `ser` Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case where a list is used as an indexer
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above changes, the `_get_with` function now properly handles the case where a list is used as an indexer for the `ser` Series. This should address the bug and ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
