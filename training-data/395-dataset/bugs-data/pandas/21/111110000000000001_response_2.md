The potential error in the problematic function '_get_with' is that it is not handling all possible types of 'key'. The function is attempting to handle different types of keys, but the logic is not straightforward and might lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles all types of keys in a clear and systematic way.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function '_get_with':

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This code simplifies the logic and handles different types of keys in a more consistent and clear manner.
