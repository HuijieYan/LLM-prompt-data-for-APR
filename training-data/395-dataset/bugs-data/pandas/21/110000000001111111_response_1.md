The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list and none of its elements match the index of the Series, causing a KeyError to be raised. This is inconsistent with how the Series behaves when the input is an array-like indexer, an Index, or a pandas Series.

To fix this bug, the code in the `_get_with` method should be modified to handle the case when `key` is a list and none of its elements match the index of the Series. The code should be updated to behave consistently for all types of input indexers.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` method:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the index")
    elif isinstance(key, list) and not any(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code handles the case when `key` is a list and none of its elements match the index of the Series by explicitly checking for this condition and raising a KeyError with the appropriate message.
