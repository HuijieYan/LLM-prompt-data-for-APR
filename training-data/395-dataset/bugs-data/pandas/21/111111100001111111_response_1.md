The bug occurs when trying to use a list as an indexer, which results in a KeyError even though using other types of indexers (such as pd.Series, pd.Index, or np.array) works as expected.

The issue may be located in the section of the function where it checks for the type of the key. When the key is a list, the function is not behaving consistently with the other types of indexers.

The reason behind the bug is that the function behaves differently when the key is a list compared to when it is an array-like indexer. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and a KeyError when using a list as an indexer.

To fix the bug, the function should treat list indexers in a manner consistent with the treatment of other indexers like pd.Series, pd.Index, or np.array. This could involve making the behavior for list indexers consistent with the behavior for array-like indexers, ensuring that they produce the expected output without raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
