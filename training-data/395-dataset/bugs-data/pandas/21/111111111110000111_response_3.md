The error occurs when using a list as an indexer for a Series. The error message indicates that the KeyError is raised because none of the index values are found in the Series when using a list as the indexer.

The issue seems to be related to the way list indexers are being handled differently from other array-like indexers. The test case provided demonstrates that using pd.Series with a list as the indexer is resulting in a KeyError, while using other array-like indexers such as pd.Index or np.array does not result in a KeyError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely around the section that handles the different types of indexers and how they are processed.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that list indexers are handled in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. This may involve making adjustments to the logic for processing list indexers within the _get_with method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
            # Treat as positional indexer
            return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, slice):
            # Convert the slice into positional indexer
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self.iloc[slobj]
        elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif isinstance(key, pd.Series):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

        # Handle other cases of list-like indexers
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected code, the logic for processing list indexers has been adjusted to ensure consistency with other array-like indexers. The function now correctly handles list indexers and should prevent the KeyError from occurring when using a list as an indexer for a Series.
