The test case provided shows that when trying to index a Series using a list indexer, it results in a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with how the Series handles other types of indexers such as arrays or Index objects.

The potential error location in the problematic function '_get_with' is in the following block of code:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
The error is occurring because when the key is a list, it is immediately passed to `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError if the list contains values that are not present in the index.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the list-like key differently and avoid the KeyError. We can use the 'reindex' method to handle the case where the key is a list and may contain values not present in the index.

Here's the corrected code for the '_get_with' function:

```python
# corrected _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the key is list-like, and if so, we use the 'reindex' method to handle the case when the key contains values not present in the index. If the key is not list-like, it is passed to `self.loc[key]` as before.
