The error occurs when the test function calls `ser[key]` where `ser` is a Series object and `key` is an array-like indexer, such as a list, np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not being correctly raised, which suggests that the behavior of the function `_get_with` is not handling array-like indexers properly.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` method. The method is not consistently handling array-like indexers, which causes the KeyError to not be raised in certain cases.

The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function does not handle array-like indexers consistently, leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing data in the Series object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` method handles array-like indexers consistently and raises a KeyError when the index is not found.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = list(key)
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, we handle array-like indexers consistently by converting them to a list and then checking if all the elements are present in the index. If any element is not found in the index, it raises a KeyError with the appropriate message. This ensures consistent behavior for accessing data in the Series object using array-like indexers.
