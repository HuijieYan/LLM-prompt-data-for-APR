The issue seems to be with how the function `_get_with` treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior and some cases raising errors.

The potential error location within the function `_get_with` seems to be in the conditional blocks that handle different types of indexers.

The bug occurs because the function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors in some cases. This is not in line with the expected behavior for indexing a Series.

To fix the bug, we can adjust the conditional blocks to handle different types of indexers consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key = np.asarray(key)

    if key.dtype == bool:
        return self.loc[key]
    if np.issubdtype(key.dtype, np.integer):
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction makes sure that different types of indexers are handled consistently, ensuring a predictable behavior when indexing a Series.
