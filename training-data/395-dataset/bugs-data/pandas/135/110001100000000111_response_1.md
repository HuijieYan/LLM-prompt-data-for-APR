Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error occurs in the `agg_series` function, specifically in the `self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)` call, where it raises an `AttributeError` if the series is backed by an EA.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The change in the `agg_series` function, specifically in the `self._aggregate_series_fast` call, is causing the `AttributeError`. This is due to the fact that the series is backed by an EA (ExtensionArray).

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `agg_series` function to handle the `AttributeError` when the series is backed by an EA and call the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` function instead. This will ensure that the AttributeError is caught and handled properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
