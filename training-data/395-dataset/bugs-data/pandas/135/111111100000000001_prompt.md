    ----------
    axis : int
        the axis to group
    groupings : array of grouping
        all the grouping instances to handle in this grouper
        for example for grouper list to groupby, need to pass the list
    sort : boolean, default True
        whether this grouper will give sorted result or not
    group_keys : boolean, default True
    mutated : boolean, default False
    indexer : intp array, optional
        the indexer created by Grouper
        some groupers (TimeGrouper) will sort its axis and its
        group_info is also sorted, so need the indexer to reorder
