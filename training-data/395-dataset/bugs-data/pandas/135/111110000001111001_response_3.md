The bug in the function `agg_series` is due to the incorrect use of exception handling. When an exception is caught and the condition is met, the function should return a value. However, in the current implementation, the function returns the output of the `_aggregate_series_fast` method outside of the `try` block. 

Another issue is that the `except AssertionError` block is catching the assertion error but not letting it propagate, which might lead to unexpected behavior. 

A correct way to handle the exceptions would be to set the value to be returned within the corresponding `except` block, and re-raise the exceptions that are not explicitly handled for proper error propagation.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

In this corrected code:
- The try block attempts to call the `_aggregate_series_fast` method.
- If an exception is raised, it is caught and checked for specific conditions. If the condition is met, the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method is called and the result is returned.
- If the exception is not explicitly handled, it is raised again to propagate the error.
