The buggy function "agg_series" is meant to aggregate a series using the fast method "_aggregate_series_fast" and fall back to the pure Python method "_aggregate_series_pure_python" if an assertion error or a specific ValueError is raised.

The issue lies in the "except AssertionError" block, which only raises the caught exception again without any specific handling. This can lead to confusion in identifying the root cause of the error.

To fix the bug, the "except AssertionError" block should be removed, and the "except ValueError" block should be modified to specifically handle the two expected ValueError cases and raise other ValueErrors. Additionally, the final "return" statement after the "except" blocks should be indented to be outside of them.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # handle specific ValueErrors
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            # raise other ValueErrors
            raise
```
