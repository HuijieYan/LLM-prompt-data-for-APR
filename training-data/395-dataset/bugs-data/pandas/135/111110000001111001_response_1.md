The buggy function `agg_series` tries to call `_aggregate_series_fast` and if there's an AssertionError, it returns `_aggregate_series_pure_python`. If `ValueError` is caught, the function checks the error message and accordingly takes action.

The potential error location is in the `except` block for `ValueError`. Inside that block, the function is catching specific error messages and handling them differently. However, in all cases, it's still returning `_aggregate_series_pure_python`, which is not correct. It should not return if a specific error message is caught.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Mishandling of specific `ValueError` messages.
2. Incorrectly returning `_aggregate_series_pure_python` even when a specific error message is caught.

To fix the bug:
- Remove the return statement for `_aggregate_series_pure_python` from inside the `except` block for catching `ValueError` messages.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction, need to handle the error message but not returning
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
With this corrected code, the function will handle specific `ValueError` messages without returning `_aggregate_series_pure_python` prematurely.
