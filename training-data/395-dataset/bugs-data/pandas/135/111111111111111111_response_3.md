The bug here is likely to be in the `_aggregate_series_fast` and `_aggregate_series_pure_python` methods, as the error message in the test function suggests an issue with the dtype of the series being different than expected.

The error occurred because of changes in the `agg_series` method, which now raises an AttributeError instead of catching it, as seen in the traceback provided.

To fix the bug, the `agg_series` method should be modified to handle DecimalArray objects properly in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class BaseGrouper():
    # ...

    # this is the corrected and updated function
    def agg_series(self, obj, func):
        try:
            return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        except (AssertionError, AttributeError):
            pass
        except ValueError as err:
            if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                pass
            else:
                raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In this corrected version, I've added an exception handling for AttributeError that catches and ignores it. This should prevent the error from being raised and allow the code to continue execution.
