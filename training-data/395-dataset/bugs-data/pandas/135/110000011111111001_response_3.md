The bug in the code is likely to be the `self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)` method. This is trying to apply a fast aggregation method, but if it fails, it falls back to a pure Python method of aggregation. The error message in both test cases suggests that the dtype of the aggregated result is different from what is expected. This indicates that the fast aggregation method may not be returning the correct dtype.

One approach to fixing this bug is to add a type check in the `self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)` method to ensure that it returns the correct dtype. If it doesn't, then the function should raise an appropriate error or fall back to the pure Python method for aggregation.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result_fast = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if not isinstance(result_fast, pd.Series):
            raise TypeError("Fast aggregation method did not return a Series.")
        return result_fast
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In this corrected method, we first check if the result of the fast aggregation method is a Series. If it's not, we raise a TypeError. If no error is raised, we return the result of the fast aggregation method. If there is an error, we check for specific error messages and handle them accordingly. Otherwise, we fall back to the pure Python method for aggregation.
