The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of ExtensionArrays, specifically the DecimalArray, in the agg_series function. This results in the dtype of the output being different from the expected dtype, leading to assertion errors in the test functions.

The bug is likely occurring in the _aggregate_series_fast function, where the DecimalArray does not have the expected attribute 'flags', leading to the AttributeError. This causes the function to fall back to _aggregate_series_pure_python, which may not handle the DecimalArray correctly, resulting in the dtype mismatch.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to properly handle DecimalArray and other ExtensionArrays in both _aggregate_series_fast and _aggregate_series_pure_python functions. This might involve checking for the attribute 'flags' in DecimalArray and providing the correct dtype when processing DecimalArray in the agg_series function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _aggregate_series_fast(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return obj.apply(func)
    except AttributeError:
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)

# relative function's signature in this file
def _aggregate_series_pure_python(self, obj, func):
    return obj.apply(func)

# Corrected agg_series function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

By making these changes, the ExtensionArray, in this case, DecimalArray, will be properly handled in both the fast and pure Python paths, ensuring that the output dtype matches the expected dtype.
