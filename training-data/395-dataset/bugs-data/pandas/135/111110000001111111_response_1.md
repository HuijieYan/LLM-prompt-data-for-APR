The bug seems to be related to the behavior of the DecimalArray in the agg_series function when used with the groupby method. The error message "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" suggests that the DecimalArray object does not have the 'flags' attribute, which is being called within the _aggregate_series_fast function.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle the DecimalArray object differently, potentially by using a different approach within the _aggregate_series_fast function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    if hasattr(obj, 'flags'):
        try:
            return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        except AssertionError:
            raise
        except ValueError as err:
            if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                # raised in libreduction
                pass
            else:
                raise
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    else:
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
``` 

This code first checks if the 'flags' attribute exists in the obj. If it does, it proceeds with the _aggregate_series_fast function, otherwise, it falls back to using the _aggregate_series_pure_python function. This should handle the AttributeError for the DecimalArray object and provide a fallback option when the attribute is not present.
