The issue with the given function `agg_series` lies within its exception handling. The current implementation catches both `AssertionError` and `ValueError` exceptions without a specific reason. Additionally, the `ValueError` is then processed based on the error message string, which is not a robust or maintainable error handling approach.

A potential reason for errors could be that the `_aggregate_series_fast` and `_aggregate_series_pure_python` methods might be raising different error types or exceptions than those being caught in the except blocks. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect error handling.

To fix the bug, the exception handling should be more specific. It should only catch the relevant errors related to the method calls being made in the try block. Furthermore, the handling of the specific exceptions should be based on the type of error rather than on the error message string.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except Exception as e:  # Catch more specific exceptions instead of "AssertionError" and "ValueError"
        # Reraise the exception if it's not the specific type of exception you are expecting
        if not isinstance(e, (expected_exception_type1, expected_exception_type2)):
            raise
        # Handle specific exceptions accordingly, for example:
        # perform specific error handling or logging
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
Replace `expected_exception_type1` and `expected_exception_type2` with the actual types of exceptions that can be raised by `_aggregate_series_fast` method.

This approach will make the error handling more robust and clearer, as it will handle specific exceptions rather than relying on error message strings.
