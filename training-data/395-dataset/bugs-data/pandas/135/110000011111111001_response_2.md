The error occurs when the `agg_series` function is called in the test cases. The `agg_series` function is expected to return values of type `decimal`, but it's currently returning objects of type `object`, causing the assertion error in the test cases.

The bug in the provided function is that the `_aggregate_series_fast` function is not correctly returning values of type `decimal` resulting in the failure of the caller function `agg_series` to handle these cases correctly.

To fix the issue, the `_aggregate_series_fast` function needs to be modified to correctly return values of type `decimal` so that the `agg_series` function can handle them appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if isinstance(result, Decimal):
            return result
        else:
            return Decimal(str(result))
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

By checking if the result is already of type `Decimal`, we can return it directly. If it's not, we convert it to a `Decimal` and return the result. This ensures that the returned values are always of type `Decimal`, addressing the issue seen in the test cases.
