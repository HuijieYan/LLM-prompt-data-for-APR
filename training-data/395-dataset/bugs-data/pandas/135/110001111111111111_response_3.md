The error message indicates that the dtype of the series is being inferred as 'object' instead of 'decimal'. This is likely due to the handling of ExtensionArray data in the `_aggregate_series_fast` and `_aggregate_series_pure_python` functions inside the `agg_series` function. 

The bug seems to be caused by a recent change to the `agg_series` function, specifically in the handling of ExtensionArray types, as mentioned in the GitHub issue #29088. The `self._aggregate_series_fast` method is giving an "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" error if the series is backed by an ExtensionArray, and the AttributeError is no longer caught.

To fix this bug, it's important to handle the ExtensionArray data types properly in the `agg_series` method. This might involve ensuring that the `_aggregate_series_fast` method can handle ExtensionArray types appropriately without throwing an AttributeError. Additionally, any AttributeError caused by ExtensionArray should be caught and handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_135/pandas/core/groupby/ops.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _aggregate_series_fast(self, obj, func):
    # ... omitted code ...
    # handle ExtensionArray types appropriately
    if hasattr(obj, 'flags'):
        try:
            return obj.values._reduce(func)
        except AttributeError:
            pass
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _aggregate_series_pure_python(self, obj, func):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (ValueError, AttributeError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In the corrected code, we handle ExtensionArray types appropriately in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method by checking if the object has the 'flags' attribute and then attempting to reduce the values using the provided function. If an AttributeError is encountered, it is caught and handled appropriately. This should address the bug related to ExtensionArray data types not being handled properly in the `agg_series` method.
