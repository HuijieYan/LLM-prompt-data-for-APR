The error is likely occurring in the `agg_series` method of the `BaseGrouper` class, specifically in the `_aggregate_series_fast` function. The error message indicates that the dtype of the resulting series is different from what is expected.

The reason for this error is likely related to the changes made in the `agg_series` method, specifically in the handling of the `DecimalArray` type. This might be causing the dtype to be inferred as 'object' instead of 'decimal', leading to the AssertionError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the dtype of the resulting series is correctly inferred as 'decimal' when using the `DecimalArray` type.

Here's the corrected `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        if isinstance(result, DecimalArray):
            result = result.astype("decimal")
        return result
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```
