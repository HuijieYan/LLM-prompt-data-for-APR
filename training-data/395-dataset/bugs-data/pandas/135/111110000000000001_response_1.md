Potential error location: The try-except block inside the `agg_series` method is catching specific exceptions (AssertionError and ValueError), but if any other error occurs, it will be caught by the generic `except` block. Additionally, the return statement is placed inside the `except` block, so it will always return the result of `_aggregate_series_pure_python`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The generic `except` block catches all exceptions, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the specific error that occurred. Additionally, the return statement is incorrectly placed inside the `except` block, leading to the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method always being called.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the generic `except` block and use specific exception handling for the `ValueError` and any other potential exceptions. Place the return statement outside of the `except` blocks to ensure that the correct result is returned.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```
