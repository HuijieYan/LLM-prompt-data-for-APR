The bug in the provided code seems to be in the `agg_series` function, specifically in the return statement where the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method is called. The bug seems to be causing a change in the data type returned by the `agg` function in the DataFrame GroupBy object, leading to an assertion error in the test cases.

The reason for this bug could be a change in the internal behavior of the `_aggregate_series_fast` method, which may be causing the TypeError to propagate and reach the block where the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method is used, resulting in an incorrect data type being returned.

To fix this bug, you can modify the return statement of the `agg_series` function to always return the result of `_aggregate_series_fast` method. In case of an exception, you can catch the error raised and handle it appropriately, but the final result should always be the result of `_aggregate_series_fast` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # Handle specific error message
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)  # Always use _aggregate_series_fast as the final result
```

By making this modification, the agg function should consistently return the data type inferred from the `_aggregate_series_fast` method, and the assertion error in the test case should be resolved.
