The error message from the test functions indicates that the dtype of the resulting Series is different from the expected dtype. This suggests that there is a problem with the dtype inference of the resulting Series.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_aggregate_series_fast` method, which is part of the class `BaseGrouper`. This method is responsible for fast aggregation of Series data.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the fast aggregation method not correctly inferring the dtype when performing aggregation operations.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the `_aggregate_series_fast` method to ensure that the dtype of the resulting Series is correctly inferred based on the aggregation operation.

```python
# Modified _aggregate_series_fast to fix dtype inference issue
def _aggregate_series_fast(self, obj, func):
    result = obj.agg(func)
    return result
```

By modifying the `_aggregate_series_fast` method to use the built-in `agg` method for aggregation, we ensure that the dtype inference is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` method within the `BaseGrouper` class:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```
