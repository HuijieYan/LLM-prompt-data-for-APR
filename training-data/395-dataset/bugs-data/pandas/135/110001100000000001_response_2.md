Potential error location:
The potential error could occur when the `_aggregate_series_fast` method raises an `AssertionError` or a `ValueError`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The current implementation of the `agg_series` function does not handle exceptions properly. It catches an `AssertionError` and re-raises it, but it does not handle other possible `ValueError` cases properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Catch specific `ValueError` cases and handle them accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function returns a value in all cases, not just when catching specific exceptions.

Corrected code:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # Handle specific ValueErrors
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
