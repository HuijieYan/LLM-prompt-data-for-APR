```python
# Buggy function source code
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

The issue with the original code was that it was not properly handling the exception and ValueError cases. The code has been fixed to use a single except block to handle both AssertionErrors and ValueErrors, and then check the error message to decide which function to call.
