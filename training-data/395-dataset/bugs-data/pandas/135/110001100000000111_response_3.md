The error is likely occurring in the `self._aggregate_series_fast` function when it tries to operate on a series backed by an `EA` (ExtensionArray) object. This is causing an "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" error.

The reason for this bug is that the `self._aggregate_series_fast` function does not handle objects of type `DecimalArray` properly, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `agg_series` function to handle the case where the series is backed by an `EA` object. You can check the type of `obj` using `isinstance` and call the appropriate aggregation function based on the type.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
# corrected function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    if isinstance(obj, DecimalArray):
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    else:
        try:
            return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
        except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
            if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                # raised in libreduction
                return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
            else:
                raise
```

With this modification, the `agg_series` function will first check if the `obj` is an instance of `DecimalArray` and call the pure Python aggregation function for it. If `obj` is not an instance of `DecimalArray`, it will attempt to use the fast aggregation function and handle any exceptions as before.
