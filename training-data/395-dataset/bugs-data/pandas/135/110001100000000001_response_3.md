Potential Error: The buggy function is not handling all possible exceptions properly. It only handles AssertionError and ValueError with specific error messages, but does not handle other potential exceptions.

Reason for the Bug: The buggy function is only handling specific error messages for ValueError and re-raising other exceptions without proper handling.

Potential Fixes:
1. Add a generic except block to handle any other exceptions that may occur.
2. Remove the unnecessary re-raise statement for AssertionError and handle it within the generic except block.

Corrected Code:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if isinstance(err, ValueError):
            if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                # raised in libreduction
                pass
            else:
                raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any other exceptions
        print("An error occurred:", e)
        # Handle the error or re-raise as needed
```
