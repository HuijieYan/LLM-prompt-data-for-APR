Potential Error Location: The potential error location is within the try-except block where the ValueError is caught. The error is not being handled correctly, as the if-else conditions are not checking for specific error messages.

Reasons for Bug: The bug occurs because the except block for ValueError does not handle specific error messages properly. It only checks for a general ValueError and does not distinguish between different error situations.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We can handle specific error messages within the except block for ValueError, so that we can take appropriate action based on the specific error message.

Corrected Code:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
