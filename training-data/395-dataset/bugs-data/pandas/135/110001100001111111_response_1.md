Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the `_aggregate_series_fast` function when the series is backed by an EA (ExtensionArray). 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is likely caused by changes in the `agg_series` function (specifically in the `_aggregate_series_fast` and `_aggregate_series_pure_python` calls) which are not handling ExtensionArrays correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the presence of EA and handle it appropriately within the `_aggregate_series_fast` function.
2. Add a conditional check for ExtensionArrays within the `agg_series` function and handle them accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_135/pandas/core/groupby/ops.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _aggregate_series_fast(self, obj, func):
    if obj._data.external:
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    # ... original implementation ...

# relative function's signature in this file
def _aggregate_series_pure_python(self, obj, func):
    # ... original implementation ...


def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AttributeError, AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce." in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        raise
```
