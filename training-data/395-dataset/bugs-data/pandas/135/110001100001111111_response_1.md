This bug seems to be related to handling the ExtensionArray (EA) type in the `agg_series` method. The error message indicates an "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" when the series is backed by an EA. 

The potential error location is in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method, which seems to be failing to handle the ExtensionArray type correctly, leading to the AttributeError.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the ExtensionArray type properly, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'flags' attribute.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_aggregate_series_fast` method to handle ExtensionArray objects correctly. This can be achieved using a try-except block to catch the AttributeError and fallback to using the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method in case of an error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In this corrected code, we added a try-except block to catch the AttributeError specifically and fallback to using the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method. We also consolidated the exception handling for AssertionError and ValueError, while checking specific error messages within the exceptions. This should address the bug related to handling ExtensionArray objects in the `agg_series` method.
