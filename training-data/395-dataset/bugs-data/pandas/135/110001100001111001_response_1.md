The issue in the provided function is that the `_aggregate_series_fast` method is called before catching any exceptions, leading to the program immediately raising an exception when an error occurs. This occurs despite the condition checks present for specific error messages. The correct approach is to enclose the call to `_aggregate_series_fast` within a try-except block to catch any AssertionError or ValueError and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```
