The error message indicates that the "dtype" of the series is different than expected. The series dtype is 'object' instead of 'decimal'.

The bug is likely in the code that calculates the aggregate series. It could be converting the datatype to 'object' instead of 'decimal', resulting in the mismatch.

To fix this bug, the following approaches can be considered:
- Ensure that the datatype conversion in the function `_aggregate_series_fast` is correctly handling decimal types.
- Check if there is any step in the aggregation process that is unintentionally changing the datatype.
- Verify that the function `_aggregate_series_pure_python` is correctly handling decimal types.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        result = self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)

        # Check if the result datatype is not 'decimal' and convert it to 'decimal' if needed
        if not isinstance(result, pd.Decimal):
            result = to_decimal(result)

        return result
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

This corrected function checks if the result of the aggregation is an instance of 'decimal', and if not, it converts it to 'decimal' using the `to_decimal` function. This should ensure that the returned aggregation result is of the correct data type.
