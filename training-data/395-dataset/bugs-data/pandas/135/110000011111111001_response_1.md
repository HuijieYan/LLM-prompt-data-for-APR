The error occurs because the variable `func` is being passed to the function `self._aggregate_series_fast` which is likely expecting a different type of input. This results in an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual output of the function.

The bug is occurring because the wrong function is being called with the input parameter `func`. The value of `func` is expected to be a lambda function for aggregation, but it is being passed to a method that doesnâ€™t recognize this type of function.

To fix this bug, the `agg_series` function should handle lambda aggregation functions appropriately:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    if callable(func):
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```

In the corrected function, the input parameter `func` is first checked to see if it is callable (i.e., a function). If it is callable, it is passed to the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method. If it is not callable, then the function proceeds to call `_aggregate_series_fast`. If an exception is caught, the function checks the error message to decide which method to call, as the original code does.
