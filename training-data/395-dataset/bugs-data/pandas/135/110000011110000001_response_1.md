The error message is showing that the attributes of the Series are different, particularly with the "dtype" attribute. This mismatch is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method, as that method is being called within a try-except block. There might be a problem with this method that is not properly handling the aggregation of decimal data types.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely that the `_aggregate_series_fast` method is not properly handling the decimal data types, leading to a mismatch in attributes such as "dtype" when the aggregation is performed.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to modify the `_aggregate_series_fast` and `_aggregate_series_pure_python` methods to handle decimal data types appropriately. This could involve explicitly checking for decimal data types and performing aggregation specific to decimals.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    except TypeError as err:
        if "cannot perform reduce with flexible type" in str(err):
            # handle aggregation error for decimal data types
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
```
