The buggy function `agg_series` has a try-except block that catches `AssertionError` and `ValueError`, but the code inside the `except ValueError` block does not handle the specific error message "No result." or "Function does not reduce". Additionally, the except block should not return the result of `_aggregate_series_pure_python` as it is not supposed to return a value when catching a ValueError.

It seems that the bug occurs because the function does not handle the specific error related to the result of `_aggregate_series_fast` and simply falls back to `_aggregate_series_pure_python` without checking the specific error message.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code inside the `except ValueError` block to handle the specific error messages related to "No result." and "Function does not reduce". Also, we should remove the return statement for `_aggregate_series_pure_python` from the `except ValueError` block since it should not return a value when catching a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            return None
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            return None
        else:
            raise
```

With the above correction, the function will handle the specific error messages related to "No result." and "Function does not reduce" appropriately, and it won't return a value when catching a ValueError.

This should address the bug and prevent the AttributeError from occurring, leading to successful aggregation without errors.
