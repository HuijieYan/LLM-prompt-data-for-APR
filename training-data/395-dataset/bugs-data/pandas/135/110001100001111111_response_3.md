The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the changes in the `agg_series` method and the implementation of `self._aggregate_series_fast`. The error message "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" suggests that there is an issue with accessing the 'flags' attribute of the 'DecimalArray' object.

The bug seems to be caused by changes in the implementation of the `agg_series` method, specifically the handling of the `_aggregate_series_fast` method. It appears that the error is not being caught as expected.

To fix this bug, the following approach can be considered:
- Check if the 'DecimalArray' object has the 'flags' attribute before accessing it within the `_aggregate_series_fast` method.
- If the 'DecimalArray' object has the 'flags' attribute, then use it as needed. Otherwise, handle the case appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` method:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError as err:
        if "flags" in str(err):
            # Handle the case where 'DecimalArray' object does not have the 'flags' attribute
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # Handle specific ValueErrors and AssertionErrors
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the 'flags' attribute error and handle it appropriately. If the error is related to the 'flags' attribute, we call the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method instead. If the error is related to other exceptions, we handle them based on their specific messages, and if none of the specific messages match, we re-raise the exception.
