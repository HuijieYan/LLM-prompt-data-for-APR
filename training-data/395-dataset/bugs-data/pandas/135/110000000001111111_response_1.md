The bug is likely occurring in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method called within the `agg_series` function, as indicated by the bug report mentioning an error related to the `DecimalArray` object.

The error is likely happening due to a recent change in the `agg_series` function in the PR #29088. This change may have caused the `AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'` error when the series is backed by an ExtensionArray.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to handle the AttributeError related to the 'DecimalArray' object when backed by an ExtensionArray, as mentioned in the bug report.

Additionally, the error handling logic within the `agg_series` function can be refactored to provide more specific error messages or warnings to aid in debugging similar issues in the future.

Here's the corrected `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError as err:
        if "flags" in str(err) and isinstance(obj, DecimalArray):
            # Handle the specific AttributeError related to DecimalArray
            return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        else:
            raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # Raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```

In this corrected function, we are explicitly checking for the AttributeError related to the 'DecimalArray' object and its 'flags' attribute. If this error occurs, we handle it by falling back to the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method, which should address the issue mentioned in the bug report.
