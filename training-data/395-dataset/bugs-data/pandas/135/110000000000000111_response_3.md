The bug in the `agg_series` function seems to be related to the handling of an AttributeError while using `self._aggregate_series_fast`. Specifically, the error message "AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags'" indicates that there is an issue with accessing the 'flags' attribute of the DecimalArray object.

The reason for this bug is likely due to a change in the behavior of DecimalArray objects, which is causing the AttributeError to be raised and is not being properly caught and handled in the `agg_series` function.

To fix this bug, we should modify the error handling in the `agg_series` function to properly catch and handle the AttributeError. Additionally, we should also ensure that the conditional checks for different error messages are correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the `agg_series` function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, ValueError) as err:
        if isinstance(err, ValueError):
            if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
                return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
        raise
```
In this corrected code, we explicitly catch both AssertionError and ValueError. For ValueError, we check if the error message contains "No result." or "Function does not reduce" and handle it accordingly. We remove the unnecessary pass statements and ensure that the ValueError is only re-raised if it doesn't match the specific error messages we're looking for.
