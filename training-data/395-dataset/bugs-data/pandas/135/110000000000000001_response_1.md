Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the exception handling block within the agg_series function.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because if an exception is caught, the function will always return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func) regardless of the type of exception that is caught. This could lead to unexpected behavior, as different exceptions should be handled differently.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the return statement within the exception handling block and handle each exception type separately.
2. Instead of catching all exceptions, catch only the specific exceptions that are expected to be raised.

Corrected Code:
```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
