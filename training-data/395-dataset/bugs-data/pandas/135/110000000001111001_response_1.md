The bug in the provided function occurs because the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method is never called when the ValueError is caught. This results in the function not returning anything in case of the specified error messages.

To fix this, we need to remove the return statement inside the `except` block and move it outside the block. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        elif "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
    return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
