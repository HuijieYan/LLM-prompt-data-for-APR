Potential error location: The error seems to occur at self._aggregate_series_fast when the series is backed by an EA (ExtensionArray). The AttributeError 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags' is not being caught.

Reasons behind the bug: The changes made in the pull request #29088 have caused the error by not catching the AttributeError properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The AttributeError 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags' should be caught and handled properly. Handling ExtensionArray related attributes and methods appropriately can resolve this issue.

```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except (AssertionError, AttributeError):
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            # raised in libreduction
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
In the above corrected code, we catch AttributeError as well and call the _aggregate_series_pure_python method when it's caught, which should handle the ExtensionArray related attributes appropriately.
