Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be occurring in the `_aggregate_series_fast` method of the `BaseGrouper` class. It throws an AttributeError: 'DecimalArray' object has no attribute 'flags' error if the series is backed by an EA, and the AttributeError is no longer caught.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The change in the `agg_series` method, specifically the change in the `self._aggregate_series_fast` method, is causing the AttributeError to no longer be caught. This change is related to the `DecimalArray` object not having the 'flags' attribute.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
In order to fix the bug, we should catch the AttributeError in the `agg_series` method and handle it appropriately, especially when the series is backed by an EA. If the AttributeError is detected, the method should fall back to using the `_aggregate_series_pure_python` method.

Corrected Code for the `agg_series` Method:
```python
def agg_series(self, obj, func):
    try:
        return self._aggregate_series_fast(obj, func)
    except AttributeError:
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
    except AssertionError:
        raise
    except ValueError as err:
        if "No result." in str(err) or "Function does not reduce" in str(err):
            pass
        else:
            raise
        return self._aggregate_series_pure_python(obj, func)
```
