The error occurs when the function tries to access the 'dtype' attribute of the input 'values' array without handling the case where 'values' is a Series object. This causes an AttributeError or TypeError, depending on the input values.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where 'values' is a Series object and access its data type using the dtypes attribute. We also need to ensure that the 'values' array is properly converted to a numpy array before performing operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _prep_values(self, values: Optional[np.ndarray] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """Convert input to numpy arrays for Cython routines"""
    if values is None:
        values = getattr(self._selected_obj, "values", self._selected_obj)

    if isinstance(values, pd.Series):
        values = values.values  # Convert Series to numpy array

    values = np.asarray(values, dtype=np.float64)  # Convert to numpy array with float64 dtype

    # Always convert inf to nan
    values[np.isinf(values)] = np.NaN

    return values
```

With this corrected code, we handle the case where 'values' is a Series by converting it to a numpy array using the values attribute. We then ensure that the 'values' array is converted to a numpy array with float64 dtype before performing any operations on it. Additionally, we handle the case where 'values' contains infinity values by converting them to NaN.
