Potential error location: The error message "assignment destination is read-only" suggests that the function is trying to modify a read-only array, which is not allowed.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not handling read-only arrays properly and is trying to modify them, resulting in the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the array is read-only before trying to modify it, and if it is, create a copy of the array to work with.
2. Use try-except blocks to handle cases where the array is read-only or cannot be modified.
3. Convert the read-only array into a modifiable array before making any changes to it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import Optional
import pandas as pd


def _prep_values(self, values: Optional[np.ndarray] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """Convert input to numpy arrays for Cython routines"""

    if values is None:
        values = getattr(self._selected_obj, "values", self._selected_obj)

    # Coerce to float64
    values = np.asarray(values, dtype=np.float64)

    # Always convert inf to nan
    values[np.isinf(values)] = np.nan

    return values
```

In the corrected code, we use `np.asarray` to explicitly convert the input values to a modifiable array with `dtype=np.float64` and then handle the conversion of `inf` to `nan`. This should ensure that the function works properly and does not encounter the "assignment destination is read-only" error.
