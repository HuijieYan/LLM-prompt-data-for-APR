The error occurs in the `_prep_values` function of the `_Window` class. The error message "assignment destination is read-only" suggests that the numpy array `values` is read-only and cannot be modified in place.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to assign `np.NaN` to elements of the `values` array, which is read-only. This is happening because the input array `arr` was set to be read-only in the test case, and when the rolling mean is calculated, the function `_prep_values` tries to modify the `values` array in place, resulting in the error.

To fix the bug, the `_prep_values` function needs to create a copy of the input array `values` before making any modifications, to ensure that the original array remains unchanged.

Here's the corrected `_prep_values` function:

```python
def _prep_values(self, values: Optional[np.ndarray] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """Convert input to numpy arrays for Cython routines"""
    if values is None:
        values = getattr(self._selected_obj, "values", self._selected_obj)

    values = values.astype('float64')  # coerce the data to float64

    # Always convert inf to nan
    values = np.where(np.isinf(values), np.NaN, values)

    return values
```

In this corrected function, `values.astype('float64')` creates a copy of `values` with the data type coerced to float64, which ensures that the original array is not modified. Then, `np.where(np.isinf(values), np.NaN, values)` replaces inf values with NaN without modifying the original array.

This fix ensures that the original array remains unchanged and prevents the "assignment destination is read-only" error.
