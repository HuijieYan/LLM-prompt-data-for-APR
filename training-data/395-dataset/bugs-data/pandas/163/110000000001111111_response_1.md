The bug in the provided function is that it's trying to modify a read-only input array, which results in a ValueError. The function is also not handling all the different data types appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input array is not read-only before making any modifications to it. Additionally, we should handle the different data types more robustly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _prep_values(self, values: Optional[np.ndarray] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """Convert input to numpy arrays for Cython routines"""
    if values is None:
        values = getattr(self._selected_obj, "values", self._selected_obj)

    values = np.array(values, dtype=np.float64)  # convert values to float64 array

    values[np.isinf(values)] = np.NaN  # convert inf to nan

    return values
```

By explicitly converting values to a new array with the float64 dtype and then replacing inf with NaN, we avoid modifying a read-only input array and handle different data types more robustly.
