The issue with this code seems to be related to null values being modified when the nunique function is called on a groupby object. The code is attempting to handle null values by replacing them with NaT using np.datetime64("NaT"), but this approach seems to be causing unintended modifications to the original dataframe.

The potential error location is likely the line `val[isna(val)] = np.datetime64("NaT")`, where it is trying to replace null values with NaT and inadvertently modifying the original dataframe.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle null values separately without modifying the original dataframe. This can be achieved by creating a mask for null values and then adjusting the calculations accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `nunique` function:

```python
def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    val = self.obj._internal_get_values()

    ids, _ = algorithms.factorize(val, sort=False)
    
    idx, counts = np.unique(ids, return_counts=True)
    unique_counts = np.zeros(len(ids), dtype=int)
    unique_counts[idx] = counts

    result = Series(unique_counts, index=self.grouper.result_index, name=self._selection_name())
    return self._reindex_output(result, fill_value=0)
```

This code should handle the null values separately without modifying the original dataframe, and provide the correct number of unique elements within each group.
