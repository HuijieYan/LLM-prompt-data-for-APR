The bug is related to the modification of the original dataframe when using the `nunique` function on a groupby object. It seems that the function is modifying null values, which is not the expected behavior.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue arises from the line:
`val[isna(val)] = np.datetime64("NaT")`

This line is replacing null values with a specific datetime value, which is unintended and causing the modification of the original dataframe.

To fix this bug, the line `val[isna(val)] = np.datetime64("NaT")` needs to be removed or commented out, as it is not required. Additionally, the handling of null values within the function needs to be reviewed to make sure that it does not lead to unintended modifications of the original dataframe.

The corrected code for the problematic function `nunique` is as follows:

```python
def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
    """
    Return number of unique elements in the group.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Number of unique values within each group.
    """
    ids, _, _ = self.grouper.group_info

    val = self.obj._internal_get_values()
    
    try:
        sorter = np.lexsort((val, ids))
    except TypeError:  # catches object dtypes
        msg = f"val.dtype must be object, got {val.dtype}"
        assert val.dtype == object, msg
        val, _ = algorithms.factorize(val, sort=False)
        sorter = np.lexsort((val, ids))
        _isna = lambda a: a == -1
    else:
        _isna = isna

    ids, val = ids[sorter], val[sorter]

    # group boundaries are where group ids change
    # unique observations are where sorted values change
    idx = np.r_[0, 1 + np.nonzero(ids[1:] != ids[:-1])[0]
    inc = np.r_[1, val[1:] != val[:-1]]

    # 1st item of each group is a new unique observation
    mask = _isna(val)
    if dropna:
        inc[idx] = 1
        inc[mask] = 0
    else:
        inc[mask & np.r_[False, mask[:-1]]] = 0
        inc[idx] = 1

    out = np.add.reduceat(inc, idx).astype("int64", copy=False)
    if len(ids):
        # NaN/NaT group exists if the head of ids is -1,
        # so remove it from res and exclude its index from idx
        if ids[0] == -1:
            res = out[1:]
            idx = idx[np.flatnonzero(idx)]
        else:
            res = out
    else:
        res = out[1:]
    ri = self.grouper.result_index

    # we might have duplications among the bins
    if len(res) != len(ri):
        res, out = np.zeros(len(ri), dtype=out.dtype), res
        res[ids[idx]] = out

    result = Series(res, index=ri, name=self._selection_name)
    return self._reindex_output(result, fill_value=0)
