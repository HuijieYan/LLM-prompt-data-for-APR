The issue seems to be with the modification of the original dataframe when using the `nunique` method on a grouped column in the dataframe. The bug is likely located within the `nunique` method provided.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of null values when calculating the number of unique elements in each group. It seems that the `nunique` method is modifying the null values in the original dataframe, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `nunique` method should be modified to correctly handle null values without modifying the original dataframe.

Here's the corrected code for the `nunique` method:

```python
def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
    """
    Return number of unique elements in the group.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Number of unique values within each group.
    """
    result = self.obj.groupby(self._get_grouper()).nunique(dropna=dropna)
    return self._wrap_aggregated_output(result, dropna=dropna)
```

In this corrected code, the `nunique` method simply delegates the computation to the `groupby` method of the original dataframe and then wraps the aggregated output in a series, without modifying the original dataframe. This approach ensures that the original dataframe is not changed when calling the `nunique` method.
