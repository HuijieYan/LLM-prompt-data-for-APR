Potential error location: The bug may be occurring in the line `result = Series(res, index=ri, name=self._selection_name)`. Here, `self._selection_name` should be a method call, not a property access. 

Reasons for the bug: The bug is likely occurring because `self._selection_name` is being accessed as a property, but it should be called as a method.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by calling the `_selection_name` method instead of accessing it as a property.

Corrected code:

```python
    def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
        """
        Return number of unique elements in the group.

        Returns
        -------
        Series
            Number of unique values within each group.
        """
        ids, _, _ = self.grouper.group_info

        val = self.obj._internal_get_values()

        # GH 27951
        # temporary fix while we wait for NumPy bug 12629 to be fixed
        val[isna(val)] = np.datetime64("NaT")

        try:
            sorter = np.lexsort((val, ids))
        except TypeError:  # catches object dtypes
            msg = f"val.dtype must be object, got {val.dtype}"
            assert val.dtype == object, msg
            val, _ = algorithms.factorize(val, sort=False)
            sorter = np.lexsort((val, ids))
            _isna = lambda a: a == -1
        else:
            _isna = isna

        ids, val = ids[sorter], val[sorter]

        # group boundaries are where group ids change
        # unique observations are where sorted values change
        idx = np.r_[0, 1 + np.nonzero(ids[1:] != ids[:-1])[0]
        inc = np.r_[1, val[1:] != val[:-1]
        
        
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
