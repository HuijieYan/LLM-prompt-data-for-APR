The issue seems to be related to how the function handles null values, as indicated by the test case where the original dataframe is modified with the nunique operation.

The potential error location within the function is the section where it handles null values. This is indicated by the comment `# GH 27951`, which suggests that it's a known issue.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly modifies the original dataframe when handling null values during the nunique operation. This results in unexpected changes to the original dataframe.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle null values without modifying the original dataframe.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with the fix:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import Series

def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> Series:
    """
    Return number of unique elements in the group.

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Number of unique values within each group.
    """
    val = self.obj[self.column]
    if dropna:
        val = val.dropna()
    else:
        val = val.fillna(method='pad')
    unique_vals = val.nunique()
    
    result = Series(unique_vals, index=self.grouper.result_index, name=self._selection_name)
    return self._reindex_output(result, fill_value=0)

# Note: The above code assumes that the function is part of a class with attributes like self.column, self.obj, self.grouper, self._selection_name, and self._reindex_output used in the original function.
```

This corrected code handles null values without modifying the original dataframe and should resolve the bug where the original dataframe was being modified.
