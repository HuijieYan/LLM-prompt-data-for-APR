The potential error location appears to be at the line `val[isna(val)] = np.datetime64("NaT")`. The error message `TypeError: a datetime.datetime is required for datetime.datetime, not numpy.datetime64` suggests that the code is trying to assign a numpy.datetime64 object to a pandas Series, which is causing a type error.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to convert the pandas Series to a datetime object before assigning the numpy.datetime64 object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def nunique(self, dropna: bool = True) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Return number of unique elements in the group.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Number of unique values within each group.
    """
    ids, _, _ = self.grouper.group_info

    val = self.obj._internal_get_values()

    # Convert to datetime object and then assign NaT
    val = pd.to_datetime(val, errors='coerce')

    # GH 27951
    # temporary fix while we wait for NumPy bug 12629 to be fixed
    val[isna(val)] = pd.NaT

    try:
        sorter = np.lexsort((val, ids))
    except TypeError:  # catches object dtypes
        msg = f"val.dtype must be object, got {val.dtype}"
        assert val.dtype == object, msg
        val, _ = algorithms.factorize(val, sort=False)
        sorter = np.lexsort((val, ids))
        _isna = lambda a: a == -1
    else:
        _isna = isna

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
In the corrected code, the `val` Series is first converted to a datetime object using `pd.to_datetime` and then the NaT value is assigned to it. This should resolve the type error and fix the bug.
