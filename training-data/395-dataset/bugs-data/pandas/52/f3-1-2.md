The issue description is:

```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.DataFrame({"GROUP": 0, "VALUE": [1.0, np.nan]})
df.groupby("GROUP")["VALUE"].nunique()
print(df)
Problem description
Original dataframe is modified:

   GROUP         VALUE
0      0  1.000000e+00
1      0 -9.223372e+18
Issue seems to have been introduced in version 1.0.0, 0.25.3 works as expected.

Expected Output
Original dataframe should not be modified.
```
