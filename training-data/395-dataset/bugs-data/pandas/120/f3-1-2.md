Steps to reproduce
In [1]: import pandas

In [2]: df = pandas.DataFrame({'type': pandas.Categorical(['AAA', 'AAA', 'B', 'C']),
   ...:                        'voltage': pandas.Series([1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]),
   ...:                        'treatment': pandas.Categorical(['T', 'C', 'T', 'C'])})

In [3]: df.groupby(['treatment', 'type']).count()
Out[3]:
                voltage
treatment type
C         AAA       1.0
          B         NaN
          C         1.0
T         AAA       1.0
          B         1.0
          C         NaN

In [4]: df.groupby(['treatment', 'type'])['voltage'].count()
Out[4]:
treatment  type
C          AAA     1
           C       1
T          AAA     1
           B       1
Name: voltage, dtype: int64
Problem description
When performing a groupby on categorical columns, categories with empty groups should be present in output. That is, the multi-index of the object returned by count() should contain the Cartesian product of all the labels of the first categorical column ("treatment" in the example above) and the second categorical column ("type") by which the grouping was performed.

The behavior in cell [3] above is correct. But in cell [4], after obtaining a pandas.core.groupby.SeriesGroupBy object, the series returned by the count() method does not have entries for all levels of the "type" categorical.

Expected Output
The output from cell [4] should be equivalent to this output, with length 6, and include values for the index values (C, B) and (T, C).

In [5]: df.groupby(['treatment', 'type']).count().squeeze()
Out[5]:
treatment  type
C          AAA     1.0
           B       NaN
           C       1.0
T          AAA     1.0
           B       1.0
           C       NaN
Name: voltage, dtype: float64
Workaround
Perform column access after calling count():

In [7]: df.groupby(['treatment', 'type']).count()['voltage']
Out[7]:
treatment  type
C          AAA     1.0
           B       NaN
           C       1.0
T          AAA     1.0
           B       1.0
           C       NaN
Name: voltage, dtype: float64
```
