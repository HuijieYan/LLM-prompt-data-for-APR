Potential error location: The potential error location in the code is when the function tries to access the `freq` attribute of the `self` and `other` variables. This can lead to an AttributeError if the `freq` attribute is not present in the objects.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function assumes that both `self` and `other` have a `freq` attribute without checking for its existence. This assumption can lead to an AttributeError if the attribute is not present.

Approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to check if the `freq` attribute exists for both `self` and `other` objects before attempting to access it. This can be done using the `hasattr` function to check for the existence of the attribute.

```python
# Corrected function
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if hasattr(result, 'freq') and result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    elif (
        not hasattr(other, 'freq') or
        not hasattr(self, 'freq') or
        other.freq is None or
        self.freq is None or
        other.freq != self.freq or
        not other.freq.is_anchored() or
        (not self.is_monotonic or not other.is_monotonic)
    ):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)

        # Invalidate the freq of `result`, which may not be correct at
        # this point, depending on the values.

        result._set_freq(None)
        result = self._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name)
        if hasattr(result, 'freq') and result.freq is None:
            result._set_freq("infer")
        return result

    # to make our life easier, "sort" the two ranges
    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:
        left, right = other, self

    # after sorting, the intersection always starts with the right index
    # and ends with the index of which the last elements is smallest
    end = min(left[-1], right[-1])
    start = right[0]

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        lslice = slice(*left.slice_locs(start, end))
        left_chunk = left.values[lslice]
        return self._shallow_copy(left_chunk)
```
In the corrected code, the function checks for the existence of the `freq` attribute using the `hasattr` function before attempting to access it. This prevents the AttributeError that could occur if the attribute is not present.
