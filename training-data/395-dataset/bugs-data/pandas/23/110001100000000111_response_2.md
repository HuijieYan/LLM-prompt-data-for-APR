The potential error in the problematic function is that it is not handling the conditions properly for different cases. It is not properly handling cases when one of the indexes has a frequency, or when the indexes do not overlap. This can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to restructure the function to properly handle different cases and conditions, such as when the indexes have different frequencies or are not overlapping.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result.freq = self.freq
        return result

    start = max(self[0], other[0])
    end = min(self[-1], other[-1])

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        common_values = self[(self >= start) & (self <= end)]
        return self._shallow_copy(common_values)
```

In the corrected code, we have changed the handling of different frequencies and overlapping conditions. We use the `max` and `min` functions to find the start and end points of the common range. Then, we use boolean indexing to extract the common values and return a new index. These changes should ensure the function handles different cases properly and returns the correct intersection of the indexes.
