The potential error in the given function is that it's not returning the correct result for the intersection of two DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex objects. The code is also unnecessarily complex and difficult to understand, which adds to the potential for errors.

The function is failing to correctly identify the intersection points of two DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex objects, and it's not handling different scenarios correctly.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic and use built-in pandas functions for intersection and sorting.

Here's the corrected code for the intersection function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    result = self & other  # Using the '&' operator to get the intersection
    if sort:
        result = result.sort_values()
    return result
```

This simplified code uses the '&' operator to find the intersection and then sorts the result if the `sort` parameter is set to `True`. This approach is more concise and uses pandas' built-in functionality for intersection and sorting, reducing the chance of errors.
