The error messages from the test function indicate that there are issues with the comparison of dtype and freq attributes while testing the `intersection` function for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

The potential error location in the code is likely within the `intersection` function where the dtype and freq attributes are being compared and may not be handled properly in some cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that there might be inconsistencies in how the dtype and freq attributes are handled and compared in the `intersection` function for different index types.

To fix this bug, the dtype and freq comparison logic within the `intersection` function needs to be checked and updated to ensure consistent handling across different index types.

Here is the corrected `intersection` function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
            if result.freq is None:
                result._set_freq("infer")
        return result
    else:
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        result_freq = getattr(result, 'freq', None)
        self_freq = getattr(self, 'freq', None)
        if result_freq != self_freq:
            result._set_freq(None)
        result = self._shallow_copy(result._data, name=result.name)
        if result.freq is None:
            result._set_freq("infer")
        return result
```

The corrected code includes additional checks for the frequency (freq) attribute and handles situations where the resulting index from the intersection has a different frequency. It also ensures that the dtype and frequency attributes are handled consistently across different index types.
