Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error in the `intersection` function seems to be related to the logic of slicing the indices and extracting the corresponding elements from the index.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may be occurring due to incorrect logic in the slicing and extraction of elements from the indices. Additionally, handling of the start and end indices might be causing unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the slicing and extraction of elements from the indices are correctly implemented.
2. Check the logic for handling the start and end indices to ensure that the intersection is calculated accurately.
3. Verify the conditions for `if end < start` and ensure that the correct type is returned based on the condition.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
        if isinstance(result, type(self)):
