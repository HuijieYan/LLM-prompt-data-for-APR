The potential error in the provided function is that the logic for finding the intersection of two datetime indexes and returning a new index or array-like object seems to be incorrect. The bug could be due to incorrect comparison or slicing of the datetime indexes.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for finding the intersection by comparing the datetime values and returning the correct slice.

Here's the corrected code for the intersection function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0 or len(other) == 0:
        return self._shallow_copy([])

    start = max(self[0], other[0])
    end = min(self[-1], other[-1])

    if start > end:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        return self._shallow_copy(self[start:end+1])
```

In the corrected code, we have fixed the comparison logic to find the start and end points of the intersection and used the `_shallow_copy` method to return the intersection of the datetime indexes. We have also handled the edge cases where either of the indexes has a length of 0 to avoid any errors.
