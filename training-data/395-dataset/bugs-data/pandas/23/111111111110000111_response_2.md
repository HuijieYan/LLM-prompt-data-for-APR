The error is occurring in the `test_intersection_empty` and `test_intersection_bug` test functions. The `assert_attr_equal("dtype", l, r, obj=obj)` assertion is failing, indicating that the `dtype` attribute of the left and right `DatetimeIndex` objects is different.

Upon analyzing the `intersection` method and the error message, we can see that the frequency (`freq`) of the resulting index is not matching the frequency of the second index.

The potential error location within the `intersection` method is the logic that handles the frequency (`freq`) of the resulting index. This logic is not correctly setting the frequency attribute of the resulting index.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the frequency of the resulting index is not being set to match the frequency of the second index when the condition to change the frequency is met.

To fix the bug, the logic for setting the frequency attribute of the resulting index should be corrected. It should properly set the frequency of the resulting index to match the frequency of the second index.

Here's the corrected code for the `intersection` method:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    # ... (previous implementation)

    # Check if the frequencies match or can be inferred
    if not isinstance(other, type(self)) or other.freq != self.freq:
        # If the frequencies don't match, create Index with frequencies combined
        combined_freq = self.freq.join(other.freq)
        result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort).asfreq(combined_freq)

        return result
```

In this corrected implementation, after checking that `other` is not of the same type as `self` or the frequencies don't match, we create an index with combined frequencies and use the `asfreq` method to set the resulting index's frequency to the combined frequency.

With this corrected implementation, the bug causing the frequency mismatch should be fixed.
