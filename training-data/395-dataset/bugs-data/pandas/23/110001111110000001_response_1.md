The provided code contains a function named `intersection` that is intended to implement specialized intersection logic for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex. However, the function contains several issues that are causing the test cases to fail.

The main issue with the `intersection` function is that it is not correctly handling the `freq` attribute of the resulting index. As a result, in the test cases, it is observed that the `freq` attribute of the resulting index is `None` instead of being equal to the `freq` of the `b` index, causing assertion errors.

To fix this issue, the `intersection` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `freq` attribute of the resulting index. This can be achieved by ensuring that the `freq` is properly maintained and propagated from the input index (`a` or `self`) to the resulting index.

Below is the corrected code for the `intersection` function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    # ... (existing code kept as is)

    # existing code...

    # to make our life easier, "sort" the two ranges
    if self[0] <= other[0]:
        left, right = self, other
    else:
        left, right = other, self

    # after sorting, the intersection always starts with the right index
    # and ends with the index of which the last elements is smallest
    end = min(left[-1], right[-1])
    start = right[0]

    if end < start:
        return type(self)(data=[])
    else:
        lslice = slice(*left.slice_locs(start, end))
        left_chunk = left.values[lslice]
        
        # Maintain the freq attribute when creating the resulting index
        result = self._shallow_copy(left_chunk)
        result.freq = self.freq  # Set the freq attribute of the resulting index
        return result
```

With this corrected code, the `intersection` function now ensures that the `freq` attribute is correctly maintained and propagated to the resulting index, resolving the assertion errors encountered in the test cases.
