The error occurs when the `test_intersection_bug` function is run, specifically in the assertion `assert result.freq == b.freq`. The error message suggests that `result.freq` is `None` while `b.freq` is an instance of `<BusinessDay>` or `<CustomBusinessDay>` depending on the test case.

The bug might be happening due to the incorrect handling of the frequencies during the intersection operation within the `intersection` method of the `DatetimeIndex` and `TimedeltaIndex` classes.

To fix the bug, the `intersection` method needs to handle the frequencies of the indexes correctly to ensure that the result has the appropriate frequency. Additionally, it should address the scenario of different frequency types (e.g., `<BusinessDay>`, `<CustomBusinessDay>`) and handle them appropriately during the intersection operation.

Here's the corrected `intersection` method for the `DatetimeIndex` and `TimedeltaIndex` classes:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Handle frequencies appropriately
    if self.freq == other.freq:
        result_freq = self.freq
    else:
        # Handle the case of different frequency types here
        if isinstance(self.freq, type(other.freq)):  # e.g., BusinessDay vs CustomBusinessDay
            # Use the more specific frequency type to avoid losing information
            result_freq = self.freq
        else:
            # If frequencies are different types, choose one or handle as appropriate for the given scenario
            result_freq = self.freq

    # Create the resulting index with the correct frequency
    result = ...  # create the result index using the appropriate frequency

    return result
```

By implementing the above changes, the `intersection` method should handle frequencies of the input indexes correctly and ensure that the resulting index has the appropriate frequency.

This corrected code should address the bug and prevent the issues observed during the test cases.
