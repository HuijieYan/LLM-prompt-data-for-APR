The error is occurring in the `intersection` function of a DatetimeIndex or TimedeltaIndex, which is used to find the common elements between two index objects.

The error message indicates that the `dtype` of the result is different from the expected dtype. This suggests that the frequency (`freq`) handling in the `intersection` function might be incorrect.

The `intersection` function seems to be mishandling the frequency attribute of the resulting index. It is failing to set the correct frequency for the result index.

To fix this bug, the `intersection` function needs to correctly handle the frequency attribute of the resulting index.

Below is the corrected code for the `intersection` function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    """
    Specialized intersection for DatetimeIndex/TimedeltaIndex.

    May be much faster than Index.intersection

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : Same type as self or array-like
    sort : False or None, default False
        Sort the resulting index if possible.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24.0

        .. versionchanged:: 0.24.1

           Changed the default to ``False`` to match the behaviour
           from before 0.24.0.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.25.0

           The `sort` keyword is added

    Returns
    -------
    y : Index or same type as self
    """
    self._validate_sort_keyword(sort)
    self._assert_can_do_setop(other)

    if self.equals(other):
        return self._get_reconciled_name_object(other)

    if len(self) == 0:
        return self.copy()
    if len(other) == 0:
        return other.copy()

    result = Index.intersection(self, other, sort=sort)
    
    # Mimic the frequency handling logic from the original function
    result.freq = self.freq if hasattr(self, 'freq') else result.freq

    return result
```

The corrected `intersection` function addresses the issue by correctly handling the frequency attribute of the resulting index. This should resolve the error messages encountered in the test cases.
