The bug in the `intersection` method seems to be related to the comparison between the frequencies of the resulting intersection and the input indices.

The error message points to `assert result.freq == b.freq` as the location where the assertion fails. The issue seems to be that `result.freq` is `None`, while `b.freq` is a non-None object of type `<BusinessDay>`.

The reason for this bug could be that the frequency of the resulting intersection is not being set properly, resulting in a default `None` value for `result.freq`, which should be the same as the frequency of the input index `b`.

One approach to fix the bug could be to ensure that the frequency of the resulting intersection is correctly set to be the same as the frequency of the input index `b`. This involves checking the frequencies of the input indices and setting the frequency of the resulting intersection accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `intersection` function:

```python
def intersection(self, other, sort=False):
    # existing code...

    # previous code...

    if result.freq is None:
        result._set_freq(other.freq)

    return result
```

In this corrected code, after obtaining the `result` from the intersection operation, we check if the frequency of the result is `None`, and if so, we set it to be the same as the frequency of the `other` index using `result._set_freq(other.freq)`.

This approach ensures that the frequency of the resulting intersection is properly set and matches the frequency of the input index `b`, addressing the bug in the original code.
