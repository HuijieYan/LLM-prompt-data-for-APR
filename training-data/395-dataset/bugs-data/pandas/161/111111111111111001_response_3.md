The problem in the `fillna` method arises from the mismatch between the input parameters (`fill_value`) and the expected output (`expected_output`) in the test cases. The test case provides a Series or Categorical object for `fill_value`, but the function seems to expect a scalar, dictionary, or Series. Therefore, the test case inputs are not compatible with the function's implementation.

To fix this issue, the `fillna` method should be updated to handle both Series and scalar values as input for `fill_value`. When a Series is provided, the fillna method should extract the values from the Series and use them for filling the missing values in the categorical data.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `fillna` method:

```python
def fillna(self, fill_value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
        fill_value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=False
    )

    if isinstance(value, ABCSeries):
        value = value.values  # Extract values from the Series

    # Rest of the implementation remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this updated implementation, the `fillna` method can handle both scalar and Series inputs correctly.

After this fix, the `test_fillna_categorical_with_new_categories` test cases should pass without any issues.
