The error occurs in the `fillna` method of the `Categorical` class. This is a bug because the `fillna` method is not handling the `Series` with categories correctly, resulting in unexpected output in the test cases.

The potential error is that the `fillna` method is not correctly handling the `Series` with categories and is not aligning the `fill_value` with the categories of the `Categorical` data.

The bug occurs because the original `fillna` method is not taking into account the categories of the `Categorical` data when filling missing values. This results in incorrect output, as observed in the error messages from the test functions.

To fix the bug, the `fillna` method should be modified to correctly align the `fill_value` Series with the categories of the `Categorical` data and fill missing values accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `fillna` method of the `Categorical` class:

```python
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        (Not implemented yet for Categorical!)
        If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
        NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
        a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
        be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
        maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
        filled.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """
    
    value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
        value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=False
    )

    if value is None:
        value = np.nan
    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet"
        )

    codes = self._codes

    # align fill_value with the categories of the Categorical data
    if isinstance(value, ABCSeries):
        value = value.astype('category')
        value = value.cat.set_categories(self.categories)

    # fill missing values according to the aligned fill_value
    codes[codes == -1] = value.cat.codes[codes == -1]

    return self._constructor(codes, dtype=self.dtype, fastpath=True)
```

This corrected method fixes the bug by aligning the `fill_value` Series with the categories of the `Categorical` data and then filling the missing values accordingly. This should resolve the issues observed in the test cases.
