Error Location:

The potential error locations within the `fillna` function are where the code checks for the method and handles the interpolation to fill the NaN values.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:

The bug occurs because the code for handling the interpolation to fill the NaN values is not correctly differentiating between NaN and non-NaN values. As a result, non-NaN values are also being overwritten during the process.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Modify the code to only replace NaN values in the specified column.
2. Ensure that when using the `fillna` method for categorical data, only NaN values are replaced with the specified value, and non-NaN values remain unchanged.

Corrected Code:

```python
@deprecate_kwarg(old_arg_name="fill_value", new_arg_name="value")
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        (Not implemented yet for Categorical!)
        If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
        NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
        a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
        be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
        maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
        filled.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """
    value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
        value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=False
    )

    if value is None:
        value = np.nan
    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet"
        )

    # Only fill NaN values
    filled = self.where(self.isna(), value)

    return filled
```

In the corrected code, the `fillna` method is modified to handle the filling of NaN values using the `where` method, ensuring that only NaN values are replaced with the specified value and non-NaN values remain unchanged.
