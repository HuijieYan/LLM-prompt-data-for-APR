The error occurs in the function `fillna` of the `Categorical` class. The issue is that when using a Series object with categories to fill the NaN values in another Series object, all the values in the target Series are being replaced, including the non-NaN values. This is due to an incorrect comparison between the value to fill and the original categories in the Categorical object.

To fix this, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted so that only the NaN values are filled with new values from the source Series.

Here's the corrected code for the `fillna` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        (Not implemented yet for Categorical!)
        If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
        NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
        a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
        be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
        maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
        filled.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """
    value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
        value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=False
    )

    if value is None:
        value = np.nan
    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet"
        )

    # mask for NaN values
    mask = self.isna()

    # fill NaN values with new value
    self[mask] = value

    return self
```

The corrected code adds a new approach to handling the filling of NaN values, effectively preventing non-NaN values from being overwritten. This corrected logic ensures that only NaN values are filled with new values from the source Series.
