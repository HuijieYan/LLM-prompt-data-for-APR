The issue with the `fillna` function is that it overwrites non-NaN values when used with categorical data. This is evident from the test cases provided, which show that the expected output is different from the actual output.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, the root cause of the issue is found in the logic used to fill NaN values based on the provided `value` parameter. The existing implementation does not handle the non-NaN values correctly and overwrites them with the fill value.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to only fill NaN values and leave non-NaN values unchanged. This can be achieved by updating the logic to only apply the fill value to NaN entries and skip the non-NaN entries.

Here is the corrected code for the `fillna` function:

```python
@deprecate_kwarg(old_arg_name="fill_value", new_arg_name="value")
def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    value, method = validate_fillna_kwargs(
        value, method, validate_scalar_dict_value=False
    )
    
    if value is None:
        value = np.nan
    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError(
            "specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet"
        )

    filled = self.copy()

    # fill NaN values with the specified value
    filled._codes[self._codes == -1] = _get_codes_for_values(value, self.categories)[self._codes == -1]

    return filled
```

With this modification, the `fillna` function will only fill NaN values with the provided value and leave non-NaN values unchanged.

This corrected implementation should address the issue and provide the expected behavior for the `fillna` function when used with categorical data.
