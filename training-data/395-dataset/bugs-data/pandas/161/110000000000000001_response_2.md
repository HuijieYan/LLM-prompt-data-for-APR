The `fill_na` function is intended to fill NA/NaN values using the specified method. However, there are a couple of issues in the original implementation.

The first issue is with the deprecation decorator `@deprecate_kwarg`. This does not seem to be a standard Python decorator. It is possible that this decorator is custom-designed for deprecation warnings for keyword arguments. However, it is not defined in the given code, so there is an assumption that it is missing and needs to be defined for the decorator to work properly.

The second issue is with the `validate_fillna_kwargs` function. This function is not defined in the provided code, so it needs to be implemented or imported from an appropriate module.

Another potential issue is the NotImplementedError being raised for the limit argument. If the limit functionality has not been implemented yet, it's a good practice to document it clearly in the function docstring and add a 'TODO' to indicate that this feature is not yet available.

Here's the corrected code for the `fill_na` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_hashable, is_scalar
from pandas.core.arrays.categorical import Categorical
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_categorical_dtype


def fillna(self, value=None, method=None, limit=None):
    """
    Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value : scalar, dict, Series
        If a scalar value is passed, it is used to fill all missing values.
        Alternatively, a Series or dict can be used to fill in different
        values for each index. The value should not be a list. The
        value(s) passed should either be in the categories or should be
        NaN.
    method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default None
        Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series.
        pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid
        backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap
    limit : int, default None
        Limit functionality has not been implemented yet.

    Returns
    -------
    filled : Categorical with NA/NaN filled
    """
    if value is None:
        value = np.nan

    if limit is not None:
        raise NotImplementedError("Specifying a limit for fillna has not been implemented yet")

    if not is_categorical_dtype(self.dtype):
        raise TypeError("Can only use .fillna with a Categorical")

    new_codes = self._codes.fillna(value=value, method=method, limit=limit)

    return Categorical.from_codes(new_codes, self.categories, self.ordered)
```
