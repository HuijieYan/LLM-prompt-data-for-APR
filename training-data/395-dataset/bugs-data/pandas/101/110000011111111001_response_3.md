The main issue with the `astype_nansafe` function seems to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values when casting to an integer type. The test cases are designed to check if the function correctly raises a ValueError when trying to convert NaT to an integer type.

The bug is likely occurring in the section of the function where it checks for nan, datetime, and timedelta types and attempts to convert them to the specified dtype. The current implementation does not handle NaT values properly when converting to integer types, which causes the ValueError not to be raised as expected in the test cases.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to explicitly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types and raise a ValueError when this conversion is not possible.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if np.isnat(arr):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged...

    if copy or is_object_dtype(arr) or is_object_dtype(dtype):
        return arr.astype(dtype, copy=True)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if the specified `dtype` is an integer type and if the `arr` array contains NaT values. If both conditions are met, we raise a ValueError, as expected in the test cases. Otherwise, the function continues with the rest of the conversion logic as before.
