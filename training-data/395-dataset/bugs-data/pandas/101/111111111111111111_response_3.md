This bug seems to be related to the function `astype_nansafe` not handling the conversion of NaN values in categorical data correctly. The error message indicates that the function is not raising a `ValueError` as expected when attempting to cast a categorical or categorical index containing NaNs to an integer dtype.

Upon closer inspection, the issue seems to be with how the function handles the conversion of NaN values in categorical data to integers. The code should handle NaN values in categorical data in a way that aligns with the expected behavior of the `astype` function.

To fix this bug, you should modify the function to properly handle the conversion of NaN values in categorical data to integers. This may involve implementing a conditional check for NaN values and treating them appropriately during the conversion process.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
        if is_categorical_dtype(arr):
            if np.any(pd.isna(arr)):
                if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
                    return arr.fillna(-1).astype(dtype, copy=copy)
                else:
                    raise TypeError("cannot astype categorical to non-integer type")
    
        # ... Rest of the function's code ...
```

This correction includes a conditional check for categorical dtype and handling of NaN values before casting to the specified dtype. This should address the issue with NaN values in categorical data not being handled correctly during the conversion process.
