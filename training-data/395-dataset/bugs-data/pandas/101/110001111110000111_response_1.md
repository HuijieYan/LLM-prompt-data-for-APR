The error occurs when the `astype_nansafe` function is called with a datetime or timedelta value that is `NaT`. This triggers a ValueError which should be handled appropriately.

The potential error location within the function is the block of code that checks for datetime or timedelta dtype and handles the NaT values.

The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle NaT values appropriately when converting them to an integer dtype. The function is not raising the ValueError as expected in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when the input array contains NaT values and ensure that the ValueError is raised when attempting to convert them to an integer dtype.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """
    # Code to handle NaT values for datetime
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to datetime")

    # Code to handle NaT values for timedelta
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.timedelta64) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to timedelta")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

With this fix, the function will now correctly handle NaT values for datetime and timedelta dtypes and raise a ValueError when attempting to convert them to an integer dtype.
