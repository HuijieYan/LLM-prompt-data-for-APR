The error in the provided function `astype_nansafe` is occurring due to the incorrect handling of NaN values while casting to integer types. The function is raising a ValueError when attempting to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. This behavior is not aligned with the expected output and is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the casting of NaN values to integer types correctly. This involves checking for NaN values and handling them appropriately during the casting process.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(arr.dtype):
        if arr.isnull().any():
            return arr.astype("Int64").array  # Use nullable integer type
    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In this corrected code, we are checking if the target dtype is an integer and if the input array is of categorical type. If both conditions are met and the input array contains null values, we are converting the array to a nullable integer type to handle NaN values appropriately.

By making these changes, the `astype_nansafe` function should now handle the casting of NaN values to integer types correctly, resolving the bug and ensuring that the test cases pass.
