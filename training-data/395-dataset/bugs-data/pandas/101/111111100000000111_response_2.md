Potential error location:
The bug seems to be in the section of code that handles the conversion of categorical data to integer data. When converting a categorical series with NaN values to an integer dtype, the function currently converts NaN to an unexpected large negative integer value.

Reasons behind the bug:
The issue occurs because the current implementation does not handle the conversion of NaN values in categorical data to integer dtype correctly. As a result, unexpected values are returned when NaN values are present in the categorical series.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the conversion of NaN values in categorical data to integer dtype. This may involve revisiting the logic for handling NaN values and ensuring that they are appropriately converted to NaN in the integer dtype, rather than resulting in unexpected large negative integer values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail if
        the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # logic for handling conversion of categorical data to integer dtype
    if is_categorical_dtype(arr) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        return arr.astype("Int64").values

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
