The potential error in the function is that the variable names used in the function (arr, dtype, copy, skipna) are redeclared in the function signature, which is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function is redefining the arguments arr, dtype, copy, and skipna again in the function signature, which leads to confusion and potential errors.

To fix the bug, we should remove the redeclaration of the arguments in the function signature.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail,
        e.g. if the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not to skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # rest of the code remains the same
