The error is occurring because the function `astype_nansafe` is not properly handling the case when the input array `arr` contains 'NaT' (Not a Time) values and it's trying to cast it to an integer type. This is leading to the test case to fail as it expects a `ValueError` but it's not being raised.

The potential error location within the `astype_nansafe` function is in the conditional block handling the conversion from datetime or timedelta types to integer types. The function is not properly handling the case when the input array `arr` contains 'NaT' values and it's trying to convert it to an integer type.

To fix this, the `astype_nansafe` function should handle the case when the input array `arr` contains 'NaT' values and it's trying to convert it to an integer type by raising a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.

Here's the corrected `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if is_object_dtype(arr):
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            if pd.isna(arr).any():
                raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
            return lib.astype_intsafe(arr.ravel(), dtype).reshape(arr.shape)

        # Rest of the function remains the same as the original one
        # ...
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check if `arr` contains 'NaT' values and raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message if it does. The rest of the function remains the same as the original. This change ensures that the function properly handles the conversion from datetime or timedelta types to integer types.
