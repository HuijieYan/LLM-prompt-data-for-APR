This function seems to handle type casting of arrays in a numpy/pandas environment. The test case is checking if the function raises a ValueError when trying to cast a NaT (Not a Time) value to an integer.

The error in the function seems to be related to handling NaT values when casting to a specific integer type. The function does not properly handle NaT values, causing the test case to fail.

The bug is likely caused by the function not having explicit handling for the conversion of NaT values to integer types. This leads to the function not raising a ValueError as expected in the test case when trying to cast NaT to an integer.

To fix the bug, the function needs to have an explicit check for NaT values and raise a ValueError when casting to an integer type is attempted.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if np.isnan(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("val", [np.datetime64("NaT"), np.timedelta64("NaT")])
@pytest.mark.parametrize("typ", [np.int64])
def test_astype_nansafe(val, typ):
    arr = np.array([val])
    msg = "Cannot convert NaT values to integer"
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=msg):
        astype_nansafe(arr, dtype=typ)
```

In the corrected function, we check if the input array `arr` contains any NaN values and if the desired dtype `dtype` is an integer type. If both conditions are met, we raise a ValueError indicating that it is not possible to convert NaT values to integer type. This correction should make the test case pass as expected.
