Here is the full code of the fixed function:

```python
class Block(PandasObject):
    """
    Canonical n-dimensional unit of homogeneous dtype contained in a pandas
    data structure
    
    Index-ignorant; let the container take care of that
    """

    # ... other code ...

    # fixed version of the replace function
    def replace(self, to_replace, value, inplace: bool = False, regex: bool = False, convert: bool = True):
        """
        replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new
        blocks here this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
        It is used in ObjectBlocks. It is here for API compatibility.
        """
        inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

        mask = self.values == to_replace
        self.values[mask] = value

        if convert:
            return self.convert()
        else:
            return [self]

    # ... other code ...

```

This fixed version of the `replace` function directly replaces the `to_replace` with `value` in the `self.values` array and then checks if conversion is needed based on the `convert` parameter. This should address the issue and prevent unnecessary data type conversions.
