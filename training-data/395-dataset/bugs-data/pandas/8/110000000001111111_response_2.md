The issue seems to be related to the `replace` method causing columns to be cast to object dtype, particularly when using `pd.NA` as the value for replacement.

Upon analyzing the test cases and expected outcomes, it appears that when the `replace` method is used with certain values such as `None`, `-np.inf`, `np.inf`, or `np.nan`, it is resulting in unexpected behavior where the dtype of the columns is being cast to object dtype even when no actual replacements are made.

The potential error seems to be in the logic of the `replace` method, specifically in the handling of certain special values like `pd.NA`, `None`, `-np.inf`, `np.inf`, and `np.nan`.

To fix this issue, one possible approach is to adjust the handling of these special values within the `replace` method to ensure that it does not lead to the unintended casting of columns to object dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def replace(
    self,
    to_replace,
    value,
    inplace: bool = False,
    regex: bool = False,
    convert: bool = True,
):
    """
    replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new
    blocks here this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is used in ObjectBlocks.  It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    # Perform the replacement
    result = super().replace(to_replace, value, inplace=inplace, regex=regex, convert=convert)
    
    # Check if the result needs to be converted back to original dtype
    if convert:
        result = result.convert_dtypes()
    
    return result
```
