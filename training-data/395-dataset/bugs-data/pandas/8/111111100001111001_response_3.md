The issue seems to be with the `replace` method in the `Block` class. In the buggy cases provided, the `replace` method is trying to replace values in the block based on certain conditions. However, there are issues with the blocks and the values being replaced, resulting in incorrect behavior.

One potential issue could be the handling of missing values, specifically when trying to perform the replacement operation.

To fix this bug, the `replace` method needs to be modified to handle missing values correctly and ensure that the replacement operation is performed as expected.

Here's the corrected `replace` method:

```python
# corrected replace method
def replace(self, to_replace, value, inplace=False, regex=False, convert=True):
    """
    replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new blocks here
    this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is used in ObjectBlocks.  It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    original_to_replace = to_replace

    if isinstance(to_replace, list):
        # Handling missing values
        to_replace = [x if pd.api.types.is_scalar(x) else np.nan for x in to_replace]

    mask = self.values == to_replace
    if not mask.any():
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        return [self.copy()]

    # Performing the replacement operation
    blocks = self.putmask(mask, value, inplace=inplace)
    if convert:
        blocks = [b.convert(numeric=False, copy=not inplace) for b in blocks]

    return blocks
```

In the corrected method, we handle missing values by converting non-scalar values in the `to_replace` list to `np.nan`. Then, we use a mask to identify values to be replaced and perform the replacement operation. Finally, if `convert` is `True`, we perform any necessary conversions.

This fix should address the issues and ensure that the `replace` method behaves as expected in all scenarios.
