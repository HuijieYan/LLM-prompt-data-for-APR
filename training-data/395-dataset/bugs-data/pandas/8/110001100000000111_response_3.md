The bug occurs in the `replace` method where the dtype of the columns is being cast to object after performing the replacement operation. This is not the expected behavior and leads to unexpected dtype casting.

The root cause of the bug is the logic in the `replace` method that checks if the variable `to_replace` is compatible with the dtype of the data. If it's not compatible, the method casts the data to an object type and retries the replacement operation. This casting to object type is not desired and leads to the dtype being changed to object.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the logic that casts the data to an object type if `to_replace` is not compatible with the dtype of the data.

Here's the corrected code for the `replace` method:

```python
def replace(self, to_replace, value, inplace: bool = False, regex: bool = False, convert: bool = True):
    """
    replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new
    blocks here this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is used in ObjectBlocks.  It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")

    original_to_replace = to_replace

    values = self.values
    if lib.is_scalar(to_replace) and isinstance(values, np.ndarray):
        to_replace = convert_scalar_for_putitemlike(to_replace, values.dtype)

    mask = missing.mask_missing(values, to_replace)

    if not mask.any():
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        return [self.copy()]

    blocks = self.putmask(mask, value, inplace=inplace)
    if convert:
        blocks = [b.convert(numeric=False, copy=not inplace) for b in blocks]
    return blocks
```
