The issue is with the `replace` function in the `Block` class. When calling the `replace` method with `pd.NA` as the value, it is causing the columns to be cast to object dtype instead of retaining their original dtypes.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `value` parameter in the `replace` function. The function tries to handle the replacement of `to_replace` with `value`, but it encounters issues with dtype conversion.

The bug is likely occurring because `pd.NA` is not being handled correctly when replacing values. The function should be updated to handle `pd.NA` and similar values without causing dtype conversion.

To fix the bug, the `replace` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the replacement of values, especially when using `pd.NA`. Additionally, the dtype handling should be refined to ensure that dtypes are not inadvertently converted.

Here's the corrected code for the `replace` function:

```python
def replace(self, to_replace, value, inplace: bool = False, regex: bool = False, convert: bool = True):
    """
    replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new
    blocks here this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is used in ObjectBlocks.  It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    original_to_replace = to_replace

    if not isinstance(value, list):
        value = [value]  # Ensure value is a list for consistent handling

    values = self.values

    if isna(value):
        value = [None if isna(x) else x for x in value]

    if lib.is_scalar(to_replace) and isinstance(values, np.ndarray):
        # The only non-DatetimeLike class that also has a non-trivial
        #  try_coerce_args is ObjectBlock, but that overrides replace,
        #  so does not get here.
        to_replace = convert_scalar_for_putitemlike(to_replace, values.dtype)

    mask = missing.mask_missing(values, to_replace)

    if not mask.any():
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        return [self.copy()]

    try:
        blocks = self.putmask(mask, value, inplace=inplace)
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        # GH 22083, TypeError or ValueError occurred within error handling
        # causes infinite loop. Cast and retry only if not objectblock.
        if is_object_dtype(self):
            raise

        assert not self._can_hold_element(value), value

        # try again with a compatible block
        block = self.astype(object)
        return block.replace(
            to_replace=original_to_replace,
            value=value,
            inplace=inplace,
            regex=regex,
            convert=convert,
        )

    if convert:
        blocks = [b.convert(numeric=False, copy=not inplace) for b in blocks]
    return blocks
```

In the corrected code, there are additional checks for `pd.NA` and `None`, and adjustments to how the replacement values are handled to prevent dtype conversion. The `replace` function should now handle `pd.NA` and similar values without causing dtype conversion issues.
