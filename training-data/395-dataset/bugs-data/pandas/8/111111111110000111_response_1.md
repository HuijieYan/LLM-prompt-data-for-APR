The error message from the test function indicates that the dtype of the columns is being cast to "object" instead of the expected "float64". This issue is occurring when calling the `replace` function with `pd.NA` as the value to replace.

The potential error location is within the `replace` function in the `Block` class. The issue seems to be related to the handling of `pd.NA` when replacing values in the DataFrame.

The bug occurs because the code within the `replace` function is not handling the replacement of `pd.NA` values correctly, leading to the casting of columns to "object" dtype.

To fix the bug, the `replace` function should be updated to handle the replacement of `pd.NA` values correctly, ensuring that the dtype of the columns remains unchanged.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def replace(
    self,
    to_replace,
    value,
    inplace: bool = False,
    regex: bool = False,
    convert: bool = True,
):
    """
    replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new
    blocks here this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is used in ObjectBlocks.  It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    original_to_replace = to_replace

    # If we cannot replace with own dtype, convert to ObjectBlock and
    # retry
    if value is pd.NA:
        value = np.nan

    if not self._can_hold_element(to_replace) or pd.NA in to_replace:
        if isinstance(to_replace, list):
            to_replace = [x for x in to_replace if self._can_hold_element(x) and x is not pd.NA]
        if not len(to_replace):
            # Avoid costly checks since there is nothing to replace in this block
            if inplace:
                return [self]
            return [self.copy()]

    values = self.values
    if lib.is_scalar(to_replace) and isinstance(values, np.ndarray):
        # The only non-DatetimeLike class that also has a non-trivial
        #  try_coerce_args is ObjectBlock, but that overrides replace,
        #  so does not get here.
        to_replace = convert_scalar_for_putitemlike(to_replace, values.dtype)

    mask = missing.mask_missing(values, to_replace)

    if not mask.any():
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        return [self.copy()]

    blocks = self.putmask(mask, value, inplace=inplace)
    if convert:
        blocks = [b.convert(numeric=False, copy=not inplace) for b in blocks]
    return blocks
```

In the corrected code, the condition for handling `pd.NA` values is explicitly checked and handled accordingly to ensure that the dtype of the columns remains unchanged. This should prevent the columns from being cast to "object" dtype when replacing values with `pd.NA`.
