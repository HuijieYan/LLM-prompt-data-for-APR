Based on the error message from the test function and the associated issue description, it seems that the bug is related to the `replace` method casting columns to object.

The bug appears to be occurring due to incorrect casting of columns to `object` type when using the `replace` method with `pd.NA`. This is leading to a change in dtype of columns.

To fix the bug, the logic for casting to `object` type needs to be reviewed to ensure that it doesn't cast to `object` unnecessarily, and it should ideally maintain the original dtype of the columns.

The corrected code for the `replace` method is as follows:

```python
def replace(self, to_replace, value, inplace: bool = False, regex: bool = False, convert: bool = True):
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    original_to_replace = to_replace

    values = self.values
    
    if not getattr(to_replace, "ndim", 0):
        to_replace = [to_replace]
    
    mask = missing.mask_missing(values, to_replace)
    
    if not mask.any():
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        return [self.copy()]
    
    try:
        blocks = self.putmask(mask, value, inplace=inplace)
    except (TypeError, ValueError):
        # Convert only if not object dtype
        if is_object_dtype(self):
            raise
    
        assert not self._can_hold_element(value), value
    
        # try again with a compatible block
        block = self.astype(object)
        return block.replace(
            to_replace=original_to_replace,
            value=value,
            inplace=inplace,
            regex=regex,
            convert=convert,
        )
    if convert:
        blocks = [b.convert(numeric=False, copy=not inplace) for b in blocks]
    return blocks
```

Please note that this is a potential fix and it needs to be tested thoroughly to ensure that it resolves the issue without introducing new bugs.
