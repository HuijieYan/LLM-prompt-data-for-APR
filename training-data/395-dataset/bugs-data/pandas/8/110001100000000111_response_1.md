Based on the GitHub issue title and description, it seems that the `replace` function is casting columns to object type when it should not. This is evident from the expected output provided in the description.

The potential error location within the `replace` function is likely the code block that handles the conversion to object block when the `_can_hold_element` check fails.

The bug occurs when the `replace` function attempts to handle the case where it cannot replace with its own dtype. It tries to convert to an ObjectBlock and then make the replacement. However, this can result in casting the columns to object type when it should not, as seen in the test case provided.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic for handling the case where it cannot replace with its own dtype. Instead of converting to ObjectBlock immediately, it should first check if the value to be replaced is compatible with the original dtype. If not, it should retain the original dtype and handle the replacement accordingly.

The corrected code for the `replace` function is as follows:
```python
# this is the corrected replace function
def replace(
    self,
    to_replace,
    value,
    inplace: bool = False,
    regex: bool = False,
    convert: bool = True,
):
    """
    replace the to_replace value with value, possible to create new
    blocks here, this is just a call to putmask. regex is not used here.
    It is here for API compatibility.
    """
    inplace = validate_bool_kwarg(inplace, "inplace")
    original_to_replace = to_replace

    # If we cannot replace with own dtype, check compatibility
    if not self._can_hold_element(to_replace):
        if not is_object_dtype(self) and not is_object_dtype(value):
            # retain original dtype and handle the replacement
            return self.putmask(to_replace, value, inplace=inplace)

        if not isinstance(to_replace, list):
            if inplace:
                return [self]
            return [self.copy()]

        to_replace = [x for x in to_replace if self._can_hold_element(x)]
        if not len(to_replace):
            # GH#28084 avoid costly checks since we can infer
            #  that there is nothing to replace in this block
            if inplace:
                return [self]
            return [self.copy()]

        if len(to_replace) == 1:
            # _can_hold_element checks have reduced this back to the
            #  scalar case and we can avoid a costly object cast
            return self.putmask(to_replace[0], value, inplace=inplace)

        # try again with a compatible block
        block = self.astype(object)
        return block.replace(
            to_replace=to_replace,
            value=value,
            inplace=inplace,
            regex=regex,
            convert=convert,
        )

    values = self.values
    if lib.is_scalar(to_replace) and isinstance(values, np.ndarray):
        # The only non-DatetimeLike class that also has a non-trivial
        #  try_coerce_args is ObjectBlock, but that overrides replace,
        #  so does not get here.
        to_replace = convert_scalar_for_putitemlike(to_replace, values.dtype)

    mask = missing.mask_missing(values, to_replace)

    if not mask.any():
        if inplace:
            return [self]
        return [self.copy()]

    blocks = self.putmask(mask, value, inplace=inplace)
    if convert:
        blocks = [b.convert(numeric=False, copy=not inplace) for b in blocks]
    return blocks
