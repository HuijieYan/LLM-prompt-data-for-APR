The error is related to the dtype of the "z" column in the resulting DataFrame. The expected dtype is "datetime64[ns]", but the actual dtype is "object". This mismatch is likely due to the incorrect handling of datetimes in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function.

The bug seems to be occurring in the section where the dtype and N/A values are determined based on the join_units. In particular, the handling of datetimes and the upcast class selection seems to be incorrect, leading to the mismatch in dtypes observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, the handling of datetimes and upcast class selection needs to be reviewed and potentially revised. Also, the upcasted_na should be properly set to NaT for missing values when dealing with datetime block.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
    
    if "datetime" in upcast_classes:
        dtype = upcast_classes["datetime"]
        return dtype[0], pd.NaT  # Use pd.NaT for missing values in datetime dtype

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By ensuring that the correct upcast class and N/A value are selected for datetime blocks, the issue with mismatched dtypes can be resolved.
