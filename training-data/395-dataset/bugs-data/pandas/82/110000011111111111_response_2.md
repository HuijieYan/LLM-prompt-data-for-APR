The error is occurring in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function, specifically in the section where the dtype and N/A values are being determined for concatenating specified units. The bug causes the datetime dtype to be converted to object when performing a left merge if any rows from the left dataframe don't have a match on the right dataframe. This behavior is different from previous versions of pandas and is causing the test case `test_merge_datetime_upcast_dtype` to fail with an AssertionError related to dtype differences.

The reason for this bug is that the function doesn't handle the case where there is no match for a row from the left dataframe in the right dataframe while performing a left merge. This results in the incorrect conversion of datetime dtype to object dtype.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the case where there is no match for a row from the left dataframe in the right dataframe. It should preserve the datetime dtype and populate the unmatched rows with NaT values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    # ... (existing code for handling single and uniform reindex joins)

    # New code to handle unmatched rows in left merge
    if hasattr(join_units[0].block, "is_na"):
        upcast_cls = "object"
        return np.dtype(upcast_cls), None

    # ... (remaining existing code for determining dtype)

    msg = "invalid dtype determination in get_concat_dtype"
    raise AssertionError(msg)
```

In the corrected code, I've added a check to see if the `is_na` attribute is present in the block of the first join unit. If it's present, we set the upcast class to "object" and return the corresponding dtype with a None N/A value. This will ensure that unmatched rows in the left merge are handled properly without affecting the datetime dtype.
