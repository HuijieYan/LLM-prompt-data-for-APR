It seems that the buggy function is trying to determine the dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units, such as blocks of data. The function seems to be encountering issues with dtype determination and handling N/A values.

The potential error location is in the section where the function tries to determine the dtype and N/A values based on the input units and their properties.

The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of different data types and N/A values when concatenating the units. It seems like the function is trying to handle different data types and N/A values but encountering issues with determining the correct dtype and N/A values for the concatenation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic for determining dtype and N/A values based on the input units. This might involve revising the conditions and checks for different data types and N/A values to ensure that the function handles them correctly for concatenation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    dtypes = [unit.block.dtype if unit.block is not None else None for unit in join_units]

    upcasted_na = np.nan
    empty_dtype = None

    if all(dt is None for dt in dtypes):
        return np.float64, np.nan

    if all(dt == dtypes[0] for dt in dtypes):
        empty_dtype = dtypes[0]
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value

    upcast_classes = defaultdict(list)

    for dtype, unit in zip(dtypes, join_units):
        if dtype is not None:
            if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.floating):
                upcast_cls = "float"
            elif np.issubdtype(dtype, np.bool_):
                upcast_cls = "bool"
            elif np.issubdtype(dtype, np.object_):
                upcast_cls = "object"
            else:
                upcast_cls = "other"

            if unit.is_na:
                upcast_cls = "NA"

            upcast_classes[upcast_cls].append(dtype)

    if "object" in upcast_classes:
        return np.dtype(np.object_), np.nan
    elif "bool" in upcast_classes:
        if any(dt is None for dt in dtypes):
            return np.dtype(np.object_), np.nan
        else:
            return np.dtype(np.bool_), None
    else:
        return empty_dtype or np.dtype("float"), upcasted_na

    msg = "invalid dtype determination in get_concat_dtype"
    raise AssertionError(msg)
```

In the corrected code, we simplified and streamlined the logic for determining dtype and N/A values based on the input units. We also handled the cases where units are None or have different data types in a more organized manner. Additionally, we used NumPy's `issubdtype` function to check for data type relationships. Lastly, we simplified the dtype determination by using the empty_dtype and upcasted_na variables directly in the return statements.
