The issue seems to be related to data type conversion during a left merge operation in pandas. In version 1.0.0rc0, when performing a left merge with a datetime64[ns] column on the right dataframe, if there are rows in the left dataframe that don't have a matching value in the right dataframe, the result dataframe ends up converting the datetime column to an object column. This behavior was not observed in versions 0.25.3 and 0.24.2.

Based on the provided code and the issue description, the potential error location within the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` could be in the section where it tries to handle upcasting of data types based on certain conditions.

The reason behind the bug could be that the upcasting logic in the function is not handling the datetime64[ns] data type properly, especially in the context of left merge operations where there are unmatched values. This results in the conversion of the datetime column to an object column.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` needs to be updated to properly handle the upcasting of datetime data types and ensure that the result maintains the datetime64[ns] data type, even when there are unmatched values during merge operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        # FIXME: integrate property
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    # Fix the upcasting for datetime data type
    if "datetime" in upcast_classes:
        return np.dtype("M8[ns]"), tslibs.iNaT

    # ... (remaining logic remains unchanged)
```

By updating the logic for handling the upcasting of datetime data types as shown above, the bug related to data type conversion during merge operations should be resolved, and the result dataframe should maintain the datetime64[ns] data type as expected.
