The issue seems to be related to the dtype conversion when performing a left merge. The bug could be located in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function, specifically in the part where it determines the dtype for the result dataframe after the merge.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of dtype conversion when there are non-matching rows in the left dataframe after the merge. This causes the datetime dtype to be converted to object dtype, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the dtype determination in cases where there are non-matching rows after the merge.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    empty_dtype = None
    upcasted_na = None
    
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            empty_dtype = np.float64
            upcasted_na = np.nan
    
    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na
    
    dtypes = [unit.dtype if unit.block is not None else None for unit in join_units]
    
    if any(dtype is not None for dtype in dtypes):
        empty_dtype = np.find_common_type(dtypes, [])
        if empty_dtype is np.object_ and not any(unit.is_na for unit in join_units if unit.block is not None):
            empty_dtype = np.datetime64
    
    return empty_dtype, upcasted_na
```

This modified function includes a more comprehensive handling of dtype determination and ensures that datetime dtype is preserved even in cases where there are non-matching rows after the merge.
