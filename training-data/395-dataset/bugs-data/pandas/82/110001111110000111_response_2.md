The error message from the test function indicates that there are differences in the data types of the "z" column between the result and the expected DataFrames. The left DataFrame has a data type of 'object' for column "z", while the right DataFrame has a data type of 'datetime64[ns]'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units)` function, where the data type and N/A values are returned for concatenating specified units.

The bug occurs because the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units)` does not handle the datetime64 and NaT values properly when merging DataFrames. In this case, when rows from the left DataFrame don't have a match on the right DataFrame, the result DataFrame is returning the datetime column as an object. This behavior is not consistent with previous versions of pandas.

To fix the bug, the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units)` function should handle datetime64 and NaT values correctly when merging DataFrames. The function should return the expected data type for the "z" column and handle NaT values appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units)` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    import numpy as np

    empty_dtype = None
    upcasted_na = None
    for unit in join_units:
        if unit.block is not None:
            dtype = unit.dtype
            if is_datetime64_dtype(dtype):
                empty_dtype = dtype
                upcasted_na = np.datetime64('NaT')
                break

    if empty_dtype is None:
        empty_dtype = np.dtype(np.object_)
        upcasted_na = np.nan
    
    return empty_dtype, upcasted_na
```

In the corrected code, the function iterates through the join_units to identify the appropriate data type for the column. If the column is of type datetime64, it sets the empty_dtype to the datetime data type and sets the upcasted_na to NaT. Otherwise, it sets the empty_dtype to object and upcasted_na to NaN. This ensures that the function handles datetime64 and NaT values properly when merging DataFrames, resolving the bug.
