The error message indicates that there is an issue with the data types of the columns in the DataFrames being compared. The `z` column has different data types in the `result` and `expected` DataFrames (`object` and `datetime64[ns]`, respectively).

The potential error location within the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function is the determination of the data type and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the conversion and data type checks for datetime values.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug could be that the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function is not correctly identifying and handling datetime data types and N/A values during concatenation and merging operations.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` needs to appropriately handle datetime data types and N/A values during concatenation. Specifically, the logic for determining the data type of datetime values and N/A values should be updated to ensure compatibility between the concatenated data.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.
    
    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.
    
    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan
    
    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        # FIXME: integrate property
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na
    
    # ... (rest of the original code)
    # The original logic for handling datetime, timedelta, and other data types should remain intact
    # ...

    # Update the handling of datetime values
    if "datetimetz" in upcast_classes:
        dtype = upcast_classes["datetimetz"]
        return dtype[0], pd.NaT
    elif "datetime" in upcast_classes:
        return np.dtype('datetime64[ns]'), pd.NaT

    # ... (rest of the original code)

    msg = "invalid dtype determination in get_concat_dtype"
    raise AssertionError(msg)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of datetime data types has been updated, ensuring that the appropriate datetime data type and N/A values are used when concatenating specified units.
