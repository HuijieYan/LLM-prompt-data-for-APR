The potential error in the problematic function is that there are several points where a return statement is missing, which could lead to the function not returning a value in some cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the missing return statements and the possibility that the function may not reach any of the existing return statements, resulting in no value being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function always returns a value. This can be achieved by adding a default return statement at the end of the function in case none of the conditions are satisfied.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Default return statement in case none of the conditions are met
    return np.dtype(np.object_), np.nan
```

By adding the default return statement, we ensure that the function always returns a value, even if none of the specific conditions are met.
