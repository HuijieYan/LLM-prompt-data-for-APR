The error message suggests that when performing a left merge on two dataframes with a datetime column on the right dataframe, if any rows from the left dataframe don't have a match on the right dataframe, the resulting dataframe converts the datetime column to an object. This behavior was not present in previous versions of the software.

The potential error within the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function is likely related to the handling of dtype and N/A values during concatenation of specified units. 

The bug is occurring because when the left merge operation fails to find a match in the right dataframe, the resulting dataframe is not correctly maintaining the dtype and populating the values with NaT. This results in the datetime column being converted to an object.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` needs to be revised to properly handle the dtype and N/A values when concatenating units. Specifically, handling of datetime columns and NaT values should be ensured to retain the correct data types.

Here's the revised and corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    empty_dtype = None
    upcasted_na = None
    for unit in join_units:
        if unit.block is not None:
            if empty_dtype is None:
                empty_dtype = unit.block.dtype
                upcasted_na = unit.block.fill_value
            else:
                if empty_dtype != unit.block.dtype:
                    empty_dtype = np.dtype(np.object_)
                    upcasted_na = np.nan
    return empty_dtype, upcasted_na
```

This corrected code checks each unit in the join_units and ensures that the empty_dtype and upcasted_na values are correctly determined based on the dtype of the unit. This should resolve the issue of datetime columns being converted to object types when a left merge operation fails to find a match.
