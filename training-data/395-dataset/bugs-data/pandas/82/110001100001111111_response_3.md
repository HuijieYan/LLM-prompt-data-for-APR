The buggy function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na()` is responsible for returning the dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

Upon analysis, it seems that the bug occurs due to the inadequate handling of datetime dtype conversion when merging dataframes. The function fails to maintain the dtype of datetime columns and incorrectly converts them to objects if there are unmatched rows from the left dataframe.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that the datetime dtype is preserved when merging the dataframes. A possible approach to achieve this is to explicitly handle the datetime dtype conversion and utilize proper checks for unmatched rows.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na()` function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    has_none_blocks = False
    dtypes = [None] * len(join_units)
    for i, unit in enumerate(join_units):
        if unit.block is None:
            has_none_blocks = True
        else:
            dtypes[i] = unit.dtype

    # ... (existing code for upcasting) ...

    # Explicit handling for datetime dtype conversion
    if "datetime" in upcast_classes:
        return np.dtype("M8[ns]"), np.datetime64("NaT")
    # ... (existing code) ...

    msg = "invalid dtype determination in get_concat_dtype"
    raise AssertionError(msg)
``` 

By explicitly handling the datetime dtype conversion and preserving the dtype during concatenation, this correction aims to resolve the issue where datetime columns were incorrectly converted to object type during merge operations. This fix should ensure that the dtype of datetime columns is maintained as expected when merging dataframes.
