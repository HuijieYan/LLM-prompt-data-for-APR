The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if-else conditions where data types are being checked and handled. 

The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrect handling of data types and NA values when concatenating specified units. This leads to the conversion of datetime data to object data, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct data types and NA values are returned when concatenating specified units. This can be achieved by correctly handling the if-else conditions and ensuring that the data types are maintained properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    has_none_blocks = False
    dtypes = [None] * len(join_units)
    for i, unit in enumerate(join_units):
        if unit.block is None:
            has_none_blocks = True
        else:
            dtypes[i] = unit.dtype

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In this corrected code, we have ensured that the correct data types and NA values are returned when concatenating specified units, which should prevent the conversion of datetime data to object data.
