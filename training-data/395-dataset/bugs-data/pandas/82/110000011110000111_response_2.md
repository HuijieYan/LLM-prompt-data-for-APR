The error message from the test function indicates that the dtype of the 'z' column is different between the result and the expected DataFrames. The expected dtype is `datetime64[ns]`, but the actual dtype is `object`. This suggests that there is an issue related to the dtype conversion or assignment in the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na`.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect dtype handling, which leads to the conversion of the datetime column to an object when performing left merge if any rows from the left dataframe don't have a match on the right dataframe. This behavior is not consistent with prior versions (0.25.3, 0.24.2) and is contrary to user expectations.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` needs to properly handle the dtype conversion for the datetime columns during the merge operation. Specifically, it should maintain the original datetime dtype and populate the unmatched rows with NaT values.

Here is the corrected function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na`:

```python
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    ...
    # existing code as it is
    
    # After upcast_classes is populated
    for val in join_units:  # to handle the datetime dtype issue
        if val is not None and is_datetime64_dtype(val.dtype):
            upcast_classes["datetime"].append(val.dtype)
    
    # TODO: de-duplicate with maybe_promote
    # create the result
    if "object" in upcast_classes:
        return np.dtype(np.object_), np.nan
    elif "bool" in upcast_classes:
        if has_none_blocks:
            return np.dtype(np.object_), np.nan
        else:
            return np.dtype(np.bool_), None
    # existing code continues...
```

In the corrected function, additional logic is added to handle the datetime dtype issue. When populating the `upcast_classes` dictionary, a check is made to append the datetime dtype to the "datetime" key in the dictionary if the `dtype` is not `None` and is a datetime dtype.

This corrected function should address the issue and maintain the original datetime dtype during the left merge operation.
