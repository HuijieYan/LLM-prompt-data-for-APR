The issue seems to stem from the way the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` handles different data types in the `join_units`. It seems that in case of a left merge with datetime64[ns] on the right dataframe, if any rows from the left dataframe don't have a match on the right dataframe, then the resulting dataframe converts datetime to be object.

One potential error location within the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function is the section where it checks for `null_upcast_classes` and `upcast_classes`. This section seems to determine the data type upcasting based on the presence of null values within the columns. However, in the case of a left merge, it may not be handling the datetime data type correctly when there are null values.

To fix this issue, the function should handle the datetime datatype explicitly when dealing with null values. It should maintain the dtype and populate values with NaT instead of converting datetime to an object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# this is the corrected function
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        # FIXME: integrate property
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    has_none_blocks = False
    dtypes = [None] * len(join_units)
    for i, unit in enumerate(join_units):
        if unit.block is None:
            has_none_blocks = True
        else:
            dtypes[i] = unit.dtype

    # Handling datetime dtype explicitly
    if any(dt == pd.DatetimeBlock for dt in dtypes):
        upcasted_na = pd.NaT
        empty_dtype = pd.DatetimeBlock
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    upcast_classes = defaultdict(list)
    null_upcast_classes = defaultdict(list)
    # other code
```

The corrected function explicitly handles the datetime data type when dealing with null values, ensuring that the dtype is maintained and NaT values are populated. This should resolve the issue of datetime dtype converting to an object after a left merge.
