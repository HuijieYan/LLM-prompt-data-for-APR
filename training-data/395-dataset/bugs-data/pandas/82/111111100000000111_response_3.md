The issue seems to be related to the dtype conversion occurring when doing a left merge with datetime64[ns] on the right dataframe. If any rows from the left dataframe don't have a match on the right dataframe, then the result dataframe converts datetime to be object instead of NaT. This behavior was observed in version 1.0.0rc0 while it worked as expected in versions 0.25.3 and 0.24.2.

In the provided code, the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` is responsible for determining the dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units. However, it seems that the logic for handling datetime dtype and NaT values is not consistent and is leading to the conversion of datetime dtype to object in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling datetime dtype and NaT values needs to be revised to ensure that the dtype is maintained and populated with NaT when appropriate.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function, taking into account the issue described:

```python
import numpy as np

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    has_none_blocks = False
    dtypes = [None] * len(join_units)
    for i, unit in enumerate(join_units):
        if unit.block is None:
            has_none_blocks = True
        else:
            dtypes[i] = unit.dtype

    upcast_classes = defaultdict(list)
    for dtype, unit in zip(dtypes, join_units):
        if dtype is None:
            continue

        if is_categorical_dtype(dtype):
            upcast_cls = "category"
        elif is_datetime64tz_dtype(dtype):
            upcast_cls = "datetimetz"
        elif issubclass(dtype.type, np.bool_):
            upcast_cls = "bool"
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(dtype):
            upcast_cls = "datetime"
        elif is_timedelta64_dtype(dtype):
            upcast_cls = "timedelta"
        elif is_float_dtype(dtype) or is_numeric_dtype(dtype):
            upcast_cls = dtype.name
        else:
            upcast_cls = "object"

        upcast_classes[upcast_cls].append(dtype)

    # Handle the case where there are only null blocks
    if "datetime" in upcast_classes and not has_none_blocks:
        dtype = np.dtype("M8[ns]")
        return dtype, np.datetime64("NaT")

    # Handle the case where there are no upcast classes
    if not upcast_classes:
        return np.dtype(np.object_), np.nan

    # Handle other cases by finding the common type
    g = np.find_common_type([], [upcast_classes])[0]
    return g, np.nan if np.issubdtype(g, np.floating) else np.datetime64("NaT")

    raise AssertionError("Invalid dtype determination in get_empty_dtype_and_na")
```

In the corrected code, we have adjusted the logic for handling datetime dtype and NaT values to ensure that the dtype is maintained and populated with NaT when appropriate. This should address the issue of dtype conversion to object during a left merge with datetime64[ns] on the right dataframe.
