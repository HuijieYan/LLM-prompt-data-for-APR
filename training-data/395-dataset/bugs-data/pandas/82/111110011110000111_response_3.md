This bug is related to the conversion of datetime dtype to object dtype during a left merge operation. Based on the error message, the issue seems to be at the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` method where the data type is not being correctly determined.

The bug seems to occur when there is an extra value in the left dataframe that doesn't have a corresponding match in the right dataframe during the merge operation. This results in a conversion of the datetime dtype to an object dtype, leading to inconsistency in the expected and actual dtypes.

To fix this bug, the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` method needs to be modified to correctly determine the data type and N/A values during concatenation specified units, especially in cases where there are unmatched values and dtype conversions.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` method:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    if _is_uniform_reindex(join_units):
        empty_dtype = join_units[0].block.dtype
        upcasted_na = join_units[0].block.fill_value
        return empty_dtype, upcasted_na

    has_none_blocks = False
    dtypes = [None] * len(join_units)
    for i, unit in enumerate(join_units):
        if unit.block is None:
            has_none_blocks = True
        else:
            dtypes[i] = unit.dtype

    upcast_classes = defaultdict(list)
    null_upcast_classes = defaultdict(list)
    for dtype, unit in zip(dtypes, join_units):
        if dtype is None:
            continue

        if pd.api.types.is_categorical_dtype(dtype):
            upcast_cls = "category"
        elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(dtype):
            upcast_cls = "datetime"
        elif pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(dtype):
            upcast_cls = "object"
        else:
            upcast_cls = "float"

        if unit.is_na:
            null_upcast_classes[upcast_cls].append(dtype)
        else:
            upcast_classes[upcast_cls].append(dtype)

    if not upcast_classes:
        upcast_classes = null_upcast_classes

    # Updated method for determining the dtype and N/A values
    if "object" in upcast_classes:
        return np.dtype(np.object_), np.nan
    elif "datetime" in upcast_classes:
        dtype = upcast_classes["datetime"]
        return dtype[0], np.datetime64('NaT')
    else:
        return np.dtype(np.object_), np.nan
```

In the corrected code, the method now correctly handles cases where there are unmatched values during concatenation and determines the appropriate dtype and N/A values to use. This should address the conversion issue from datetime dtype to object dtype during merge operations.
