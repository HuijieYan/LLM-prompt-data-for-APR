The issue seems to be related to the data type conversion when performing a left merge with datetime64[ns] on the right dataframe in Pandas version 1.0.0rc0. If any rows from the left dataframe don't have a match on the right dataframe, then the result dataframe converts datetime to object. This behavior differs from previous versions such as 0.25.3 and 0.24.2 where the dtype was maintained and values were populated with NaT.

The problem likely occurs in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function, specifically in the logic for determining the data type and N/A values when concatenating specified units. The issue could be related to the condition for handling datetime data types and the upcasting process.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the logic in the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function correctly handles the upcasting of datetime data types and properly maintains the dtype and populates values with NaT when performing the merge.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict
import pandas.api.types as pdtypes
import pandas.core.common as com

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    if len(join_units) == 1:
        blk = join_units[0].block
        if blk is None:
            return np.float64, np.nan

    # New logic for handling datetime data type
    if all(unit.is_na for unit in join_units):
        return np.dtype("M8[ns]"), pdtypes.NaT

    upcast_cls = com.get_upcast_dtypes([unit.dtype for unit in join_units])
    empty_dtype = np.find_common_type(upcast_cls, [])
    upcasted_na = empty_dtype.type(pdtypes.nan)

    return empty_dtype, upcasted_na
```

In the fixed code, we added a new logic to handle the datetime data type. The function now checks if all units have NA values, and if so, it returns the datetime dtype and pdtypes.NaT.

This fix should address the issue of dtype conversion when performing the merge operation and ensure that datetime values are properly maintained.
