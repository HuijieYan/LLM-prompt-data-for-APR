The test case `test_merge_datetime_upcast_dtype` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` and then merges them using the `pd.merge` function. It expects the result of the merge to have a datetime column `z` with the third value as NaT (Not a Time). However, it fails with an assertion error related to the dtype of the `z` column.

The error occurs because the function `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` is not handling datetime columns correctly, leading to the erroneous dtype mismatch in the result.

The potential error location within the function is in the section that checks for upcast classes. The function is not identifying the correct dtype for datetime columns, leading to the dtype mismatch observed in the test.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly identify and handle datetime columns to ensure the correct dtype is used. Additionally, it should return NaT for missing datetime values.

The corrected code for the `_get_empty_dtype_and_na` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64tz_dtype
from pandas.api.types import is_datetime64_dtype

def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.

    Returns
    -------
    dtype
    na
    """
    has_datetime_block = any([is_datetime64_dtype(unit.block.dtype) for unit in join_units])

    if has_datetime_block:
        return np.dtype("datetime64[ns]"), pd.NaT
    else:
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
        if len(join_units) == 1:
            blk = join_units[0].block
            if blk is None:
                return np.float64, np.nan
        # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

This corrected code includes a check for datetime columns and appropriately returns the datetime dtype and NaT for missing values.
