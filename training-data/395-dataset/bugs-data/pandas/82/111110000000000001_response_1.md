Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the implementation of the logic to determine the dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug could be occurring due to incorrect logic in determining the dtype and N/A values based on the join_units.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Update the logic for determining dtype and N/A values based on the properties of the join_units.
2. Refactor the implementation to handle different data types and N/A values more effectively.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def _get_empty_dtype_and_na(join_units):
    """
    Return dtype and N/A values to use when concatenating specified units.

    Returned N/A value may be None which means there was no casting involved.
