The test case `test_from_codes_with_nullable_int` creates a Series of nullable integer type (`Int64`) and then attempts to create a `Categorical` from these codes. The error message indicates that the function is expecting the codes to be array-like integers, but the nullable integer type Series is causing an issue.

The potential error location is within the `from_codes` method of the `Categorical` class. The error is likely occurring because the function does not handle the nullable integer type (`Int64`) correctly.

The bug occurs because the `Categorical.from_codes` method does not handle the new nullable integer type (`Int64`) introduced in Pandas. It expects the input to be of type `array-like of int`, but the input provided during the test case is not recognized as such.

To fix the bug, the `from_codes` method should be modified to handle the nullable integer type (`Int64`) correctly, allowing it to create a `Categorical` from nullable integer type codes.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_codes` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(codes):
        codes = pd.arrays.IntegerArray(codes)
    else:
        raise ValueError("codes need to be array-like integers")

    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype)
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or 'dtype'. Both were None."
        raise ValueError(msg)

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```

In this corrected code:
- We check if the input `codes` is an integer type using `pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype`.
- If it is, we convert it to a `pd.arrays.IntegerArray` to handle the nullable integer type (`Int64`) correctly.
- If it's not an integer type, we raise a `ValueError` as before.

This fix allows the `from_codes` method to handle nullable integer type codes correctly and resolves the bug.
