The error message "ValueError: codes need to be array-like integers" indicates that there is a problem with the input data type for the `from_codes` method of the `Categorical` class. The issue seems to be related to the new nullable `Int64` dtype introduced in pandas.

The potential error location within the `from_codes` method is the line:
```python
codes = np.asarray(codes)  # #21767
```
This line attempts to convert the input `codes` into a numpy array, which seems to be causing the issue with the new nullable `Int64` dtype.

The bug occurs because the conversion of the input `codes` to a numpy array doesn't handle the new nullable `Int64` dtype correctly. As a result, the method expects non-nullable integer codes, which leads to the ValueError.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the code to handle the new nullable `Int64` dtype correctly. It may involve using conditional checks to convert the nullable `Int64` codes into a suitable format that can be used by the `Categorical` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_codes` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
        categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
    )
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = (
            "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
            "'dtype'. Both were None."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    codes = pd.array(codes, fastpath=True)
    if len(codes) and (codes.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes.min() < -1):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```
