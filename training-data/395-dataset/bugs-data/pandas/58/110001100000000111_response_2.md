The error is occurring in the `Categorical.from_codes` method when it is called with a `pd.Series` of dtype "Int64". The error message suggests that the method expects the codes to be array-like integers, but it is not recognizing the "Int64" dtype.

The bug is likely in the type checking part of the `from_codes` method, specifically where it checks if the codes are array-like integers. It may be failing to recognize the "Int64" dtype as valid for the codes.

To fix the bug, the `from_codes` method needs to be updated to recognize the "Int64" dtype as valid for the codes. This could involve updating the type checking logic to handle nullable integer dtypes like "Int64".

Here's the corrected `from_codes` method:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_58/pandas/core/arrays/categorical.py

@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    """
    Make a Categorical type from codes and categories or dtype.
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...
    """
    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
        categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
    )
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = (
            "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
            "'dtype'. Both were None."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    codes = np.asarray(codes)  # #21767
    # Update the type checking logic to handle "Int64" dtype
    if len(codes) and not is_integer_dtype(codes) and not issubclass(codes.dtype.type, (np.integer, np.bool_)):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be array-like integers")

    if len(codes) and (codes.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes.min() < -1):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```

In the corrected method, the type checking logic for codes has been updated to handle nullable integer dtypes like "Int64". Now, when the `from_codes` method is called with a `pd.Series` of dtype "Int64", it should not raise the "codes need to be array-like integers" error.
