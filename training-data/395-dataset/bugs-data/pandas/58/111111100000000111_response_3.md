The test case provided is trying to create a `Categorical` from codes using a Series with the Int64 dtype. However, the `Categorical.from_codes` function is raising a ValueError, stating that "codes need to be array-like integers". This is unexpected behavior and indicates a bug in the `Categorical.from_codes` function.

The potential error in the code is the line `codes = np.asarray(codes)` within the `from_codes` method. This line is attempting to convert the input codes into a NumPy array, but it fails for nullable Int64 dtype.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not handling the new nullable Int64 dtype properly, leading to the ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the `from_codes` method needs to be modified to handle the new nullable Int64 dtype correctly. This can be achieved by checking the dtype of the input codes and converting the nullable Int64 dtype to a regular integer dtype before processing the codes.

The corrected code for the `from_codes` method is as follows:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
        categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
    )
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = (
            "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
            "'dtype'. Both were None."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    codes = pd.array(codes, dtype=dtype.categories.dtype)
    if len(codes) and (codes.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes.min() < -1):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```

In the corrected code, the input codes are converted to a pandas array using `pd.array`, and the dtype is explicitly set to `dtype.categories.dtype`, which handles the nullable Int64 dtype correctly. This should fix the issue with creating a `Categorical` from codes using the new nullable Int64 dtype.
