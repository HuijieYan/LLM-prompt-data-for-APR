Potential error location: 
The error might be caused by the condition `if len(codes)` as this may not handle the `codes` variable correctly when its length is 0. Additionally, the method `is_integer_dtype` is being called on an array-like object (`codes`) which might not be the intended input for this function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `len(codes)` check assumes that `codes` is a Python list or a type that supports the `len` function, leading to potential issues when `codes` is an array-like object.
2. Using `is_integer_dtype` on an array-like object might not produce the intended results and should be handled differently.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Convert the `codes` input to an array-like object and handle its length appropriately.
2. Utilize a correct method to check if the elements in `codes` are integer-like.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import CategoricalDtype

@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
        categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
    )
    if dtype.categories is None:
        msg = (
            "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
            "'dtype'. Both were None."
        )
        raise ValueError(msg)

    codes_array = np.asarray(codes)
    if len(codes_array) and not np.issubdtype(codes_array.dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be array-like integers")

    if len(codes_array) and (codes_array.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes_array.min() < -1):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

    return cls(codes_array, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
