Potential error location: 
The error is likely caused by the fact that the `from_codes` method is missing the `@classmethod` decorator, which is used to define a method that operates on the class and not on the instance of the class.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `@classmethod` decorator is missing, which means that the method is expecting an instance of the class as the first argument (`self`), but it should be expecting the class itself as the first argument (`cls`). This discrepancy causes the method to fail when calling it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add the `@classmethod` decorator before the `from_codes` method to properly define it as a class method.
2. Change the method signature to accept `cls` as the first argument, instead of `self`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Categorical:
    @classmethod
    def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
        """
        Make a Categorical type from codes and categories or dtype.
        ...
        """
        dtype = CategoricalDtype._from_values_or_dtype(
            categories=categories, ordered=ordered, dtype=dtype
        )
        if dtype.categories is None:
            msg = (
                "The categories must be provided in 'categories' or "
                "'dtype'. Both were None."
            )
            raise ValueError(msg)

        codes = np.asarray(codes)
        if len(codes) and not is_integer_dtype(codes):
            raise ValueError("codes need to be array-like integers")

        if len(codes) and (codes.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes.min() < -1):
            raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

        return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```
