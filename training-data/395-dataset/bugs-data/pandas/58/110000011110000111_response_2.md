1. The test case is trying to use the `Categorical.from_codes` method with an array containing both integers and missing values (NaN). The error message indicates that the input is being treated as an array of objects instead of array-like integers, and as a result, it fails with a ValueError.

2. The potential error location within the `from_codes` method is identified as the `codes = np.asarray(codes)` line where it is converting the input into an array of objects.

3. The bug occurs because the `np.asarray` function converts the input array into an array of objects when it contains missing values. This conversion is not compatible with the expectation that `codes` should be an array-like of integers.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle missing values in the input array before converting it to an array of integers. We can do this by first replacing missing values with a sentinel value (e.g., -1) and then converting the array to integers. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the input array is already of integer type and does not need conversion.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `from_codes` method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_codes(cls, codes, categories=None, ordered=None, dtype=None):
    # ... (other existing code)

    codes = pd.array(codes, dtype="Int64")
    if codes.hasnans:
        raise ValueError("codes cannot contain NA values")
    
    codes = codes.fillna(-1).astype('int')
    
    if len(codes) and (codes.max() >= len(dtype.categories) or codes.min() < -1):
        raise ValueError("codes need to be between -1 and len(categories)-1")

    return cls(codes, dtype=dtype, fastpath=True)
```

With these changes, the `from_codes` method should handle input arrays with missing values correctly and convert them to an array of integers as expected.
