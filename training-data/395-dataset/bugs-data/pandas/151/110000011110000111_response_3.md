Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error in the function seems to be related to the data type inference using `np.result_type`. The function is converting the value 't' into a data type, which is resulting in the error since 't' is not a recognized data type.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the function tries to infer the data type of the value being set using `np.result_type`. This approach is not ideal for non-numeric or unrecognized data types, leading to a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can approach the bug by explicitly converting the value to the expected data type instead of inferring it. Additionally, we should handle the case where the dtype is an object and allow setting of string values.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    values = self._ndarray

    if np.issubdtype(values.dtype, np.object_) and not np.issubdtype(value.dtype, np.object_):
        values[key] = np.array(value, dtype=object)
    else:
        values[key] = value

    self._ndarray = values
```
In the corrected code, we explicitly check if the dtype is an object and handle the case where the value is a string. We eliminate the use of `np.result_type` for inferring data types and directly handle the assignment of the value based on its type.
