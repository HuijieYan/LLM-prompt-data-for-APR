The issue seems to be related to the `PandasArray.__setitem__` method. The function is designed to set the value at a specified index position. However, it seems that the method is encountering a type error when trying to set a new value to the array.

The potential error seems to be in the portion of the code where the data type `t` is being determined using `np.result_type(value, values)`. This might be causing the "TypeError: data type not understood" issue.

The reason for this bug could be that the code is trying to determine the data type of the new value `value` and the existing array `values`, and might be encountering an error because the data types are not compatible.

A possible approach for fixing the bug could be to explicitly convert the new value to the data type of the existing array before setting it. This can be done using the `astype` method on the NumPy array and setting it to the specified index location.

Here's the corrected code for the `PandasArray.__setitem__` method:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    if not np.isscalar(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    self._ndarray[key] = value
```

This revised approach directly sets the value at the specified index and does not rely on determining the data type beforehand. This should resolve the type error encountered in the original code.
