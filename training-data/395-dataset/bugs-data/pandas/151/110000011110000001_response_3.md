The error message seems to be related to a data type mismatch when trying to set a value using the `__setitem__` method. The test cases are attempting to change elements in the PandasArray object by assigning a new value to the specified index.

The issue is likely in the logic of the `__setitem__` method. It seems that the method is not handling the scenario where the provided value is of a different data type than the array. It's trying to use `np.result_type()` to determine the type for casting, but it is failing due to the mismatch in data types.

To fix the bug, the `__setitem__` method should handle the case where the data type of the provided value is different from the data type of the array. It can check for this type mismatch and then convert the data type of the array if necessary before performing the assignment.

Here's the corrected `__setitem__` method:

```python
# Corrected __setitem__ method
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    values = self._ndarray
    if values.dtype != value.dtype:
        values = values.astype(value.dtype, casting="safe")
    
    values[key] = value
    self._ndarray = values
    self._dtype = PandasDtype(values.dtype)
```

This revised method first checks if the data type of the provided `value` is different from the data type of the array. If it is different, it converts the data type of the array to match. Then it assigns the `value` to the specified `key`. Finally, it updates the `_ndarray` attribute and the `_dtype` attribute as needed.
