Potential error location: 
The error may be occurring during the data type conversion where the result type of the value and the existing ndarray is being calculated. This may lead to the data type "t" not being understood, as mentioned in the error message.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may be occurring because the data type ("t") resulting from the `np.result_type` function is not being handled correctly. This can cause unexpected behavior and lead to the data type not being understood.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type conversion logic and ensure that it handles different data types properly.
2. Ensure that the conversion of data types is done in a way that is compatible with all types of values that may be set.

```python
# Corrected function

def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    values = self._ndarray
    values[key] = value
    self._dtype = PandasDtype(values.dtype)
    self._ndarray = values
```
In the corrected function, the logic for handling the data type of the values being set has been simplified. The `np.result_type` call has been removed, and the data type of the values is directly used to update the underlying ndarray. This should fix the potential bug related to data type conversion.
