The bug in the provided function `__setitem__` seems to be related to the conversion of the `value` to a numpy array. This is visible from the error message `TypeError: data type "t" not understood` which suggests that the data type of `value` is causing the issue.

The bug occurs when trying to set an item in the PandasArray with a string value. When this happens, the function attempts to determine the result type between the input `value` and the existing values in the array. This comparison can fail when working with strings or non-numeric values, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, the `dtype` of the array should be checked and handled separately for string values.

Fixed code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)
    
    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)
    
    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        if isinstance(value, str):  # check if value is a string
            t = np.dtype('O')  # set the dtype to object for strings
        else:
            value = np.asarray(value)
            t = np.result_type(value, self._ndarray)  # calculate result type for non-string values

        if t != self._ndarray.dtype:
            self._ndarray = self._ndarray.astype(t, casting="safe")
            self._dtype = PandasDtype(t)
        self._ndarray[key] = value
    else:
        self._ndarray[key] = value
```

This code fixes the bug by explicitly checking the type of `value` and setting the appropriate dtype for strings to 'object' (denoted as 'O' in NumPy dtypes). Then it continues with the assignment based on the calculated dtype as before.
