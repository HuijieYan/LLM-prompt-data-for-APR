The error message indicates a "TypeError: data type 't' not understood" when trying to set an element in the array to "t". This suggests that there is an issue when setting the data type of the array element to a string.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `t = np.result_type(value, values)`. This line is trying to determine the type of the result when setting a new value into the array.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to assign a value directly to the array without taking into account the data type of the value being assigned. This can lead to a mismatch in data types.

To fix this bug, the code should perform type checking and coercion explicitly before assigning a new value to the array. This will ensure that the data types are compatible and prevent the "data type 't' not understood" error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    value = extract_array(value, extract_numpy=True)

    if not lib.is_scalar(key) and is_list_like(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not lib.is_scalar(value):
        value = np.asarray(value)

    key = np.asarray(key)
    
    if value.dtype != self._ndarray.dtype:
        raise ValueError("Data type mismatch")
    else:
        self._ndarray[key] = value
```
