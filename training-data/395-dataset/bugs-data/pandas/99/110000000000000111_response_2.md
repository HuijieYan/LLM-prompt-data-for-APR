The bug is likely occurring due to the handling of nullable integer type (Int64) in the to_datetime function. The error message "Argument 'values' has incorrect type (expected numpy.ndarray, got IntegerArray)" indicates that the function is expecting a numpy array but receiving an IntegerArray instead.

This issue occurs when a nullable int type (Int64) is used with to_datetime. The function is not handling this input type correctly and thus resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the nullable int type (Int64) input correctly. Specifically, the function should handle the IntegerArray type as well as the expected numpy array.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import Index
from pandas import DatetimeIndex
from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import _format_is_iso, maybe_convert_dtype, objects_to_datetime64ns

def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")

    # Handle nullable int type (Int64)
    if hasattr(arg, 'array'):
        arg = arg.array

    # Other code remains the same as the original function
  
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    utc = tz == "utc"
    return _box_as_indexlike(result, utc=utc, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, a check for the presence of the 'array' attribute has been added to handle the nullable int type (Int64) input correctly. This change should address the TypeError when using to_datetime with nullable int type.
