The potential error in the function is that it is trying to access a variable called "np" without importing the numpy library. This is evident from the line:
if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")
        
The reason for the occurrence of this bug is that the function is trying to use the np.array function without importing the numpy library, resulting in a NameError.

To fix this bug, the numpy library needs to be imported at the beginning of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
import numpy as np
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """
    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
```
