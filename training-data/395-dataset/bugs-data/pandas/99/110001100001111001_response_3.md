The error occurs in the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function. The issue is with the variable `arg` being an `IntegerArray` type, which is not compatible with the subsequent operations in the code.

The bug occurs because there's an attempt to convert the `arg` variable to a DatetimeIndex without handling the possibility of it being an IntegerArray initially.

To fix the bug, the `arg` variable should be converted to a suitable format (e.g., a list or array of integers) before attempting to perform datetime operations on it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
        arg,
        format,
        name=None,
        tz=None,
        unit=None,
        errors=None,
        infer_datetime_format=None,
        dayfirst=None,
        yearfirst=None,
        exact=None,
):
    from pandas import DatetimeIndex
    import numpy as np
    
    if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg)
    
    # rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, we check if `arg` is a list or tuple, and if it is, we convert it to a numpy array. This ensures that the subsequent operations in the function can be performed on the `arg` variable successfully without encountering type compatibility issues.
