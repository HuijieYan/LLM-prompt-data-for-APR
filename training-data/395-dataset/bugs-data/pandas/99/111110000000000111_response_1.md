The bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer types in the to_datetime function. The error message "TypeError: Argument 'values' has incorrect type (expected numpy.ndarray, got IntegerArray)" indicates that the function expects a numpy.ndarray but receives an IntegerArray instead.

The potential error location within the provided function is likely in the part where it handles the input argument 'arg' for nullable int type.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is not properly handling nullable integer types, leading to a type mismatch and resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle nullable integer types properly and ensure that the input type is correctly converted to a numpy.ndarray.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (remaining parameters)

    Returns
    -------
    Index-like of parsed dates
    """
    if isinstance(arg, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(arg):
        arg = arg.astype('Int64')
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to see if the input argument 'arg' is a pandas Series and if it has an integer dtype. If so, we convert it to 'Int64' type to handle nullable integers properly.
