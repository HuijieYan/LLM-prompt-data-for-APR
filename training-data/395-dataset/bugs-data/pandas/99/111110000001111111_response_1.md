The bug occurs in the section of the code that deals with converting IntegerArray to datetime. The error message "TypeError: Argument 'values' has incorrect type (expected numpy.ndarray, got IntegerArray)" indicates that the function expects a numpy.ndarray but is instead receiving an IntegerArray.

The issue arises because the code attempts to directly convert the IntegerArray `arg` into a numpy array without accounting for the fact that it is a nullable integer array. This causes a mismatch in the type of the input, leading to the error.

To fix this issue, the code needs to handle the IntegerArray input appropriately and ensure that the conversion to numpy array is done in a way that accounts for the nullable integer type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")

    elif isinstance(arg, pd.IntegerArray):
        arg = arg.to_numpy()  # Convert IntegerArray to numpy array

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to handle the case where the input `arg` is of type `pd.IntegerArray`. It then uses the `to_numpy()` method to correctly convert the IntegerArray to a numpy array. This ensures that the function can handle IntegerArray inputs without encountering the previous type mismatch issue.
