The potential error in the provided function is that the function definition does not have proper indentation, and it seems to be missing some dependencies like 'np' and 'tslib', which are used in the function body. Additionally, the function definition seems to be incomplete as it references other functions that are not included in the provided code.

The bug is likely occurring due to the missing dependencies 'np' and 'tslib', as well as the incomplete function definition.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all necessary dependencies are imported at the beginning of the file, and the function should be properly defined with the correct indentation. Additionally, if the function references other functions that are not included in the code snippet, those functions need to be implemented or imported as well.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
        arg,
        format,
        name=None,
        tz=None,
        unit=None,
        errors=None,
        infer_datetime_format=None,
        dayfirst=None,
        yearfirst=None,
        exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg : list, tuple, ndarray, Series, Index
        date to be parsed
    name : object
        None or string for the Index name
    tz : object
        None or 'utc'
    unit : string
        None or string of the frequency of the passed data
    errors : string
        error handing behaviors from to_datetime, 'raise', 'coerce', 'ignore'
    infer_datetime_format : boolean
        inferring format behavior from to_datetime
    dayfirst : boolean
        dayfirst parsing behavior from to_datetime
    yearfirst : boolean
        yearfirst parsing behavior from to_datetime
    exact : boolean
        exact format matching behavior from to_datetime

    Returns
    -------
    Index-like of parsed dates
    """
    import numpy as np  # Add the import for numpy

    from pandas import DatetimeIndex
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
    from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import (
        maybe_convert_dtype,
        objects_to_datetime64ns,
    )

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

Please note that the complete code would require the correct implementation or import of the referenced functions (`_guess_datetime_format_for_array`, `is_datetime64tz_dtype`, `is_datetime64_ns_dtype`, etc.), which are not provided in the given code snippet.
