Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function in the `pandas/core/tools/datetimes.py` file. The error message indicates that the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function is receiving an incorrect number of arguments. This suggests a problem with the way the function is being called.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function requires at least 3 positional arguments, but it is being called with only 2 positional arguments. This discrepancy in the number of arguments causes the `TypeError` to be raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function is called with the correct number of arguments.
2. Check if any positional arguments are missing or if any additional arguments are unnecessary.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
Below is the corrected code for the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    Parameters
    ----------
    (parameter details remain the same as in the original function definition)
    """

    # (existing code remains the same up to the point of calling array_with_unit_to_datetime)

    if unit is not None:
        if format is not None:
            raise ValueError("cannot specify both format and unit")

        # Call array_with_unit_to_datetime with the required arguments
        result, tz_parsed = tslib.array_with_unit_to_datetime(arg._ndarray_values, unit, errors=errors, unit=unit)  # Update the function call to pass the necessary arguments
        # Remaining code remains the same

    # (rest of the function code remains the same)

    return _box_as_indexlike(result, utc=utc, name=name)
```

In the corrected code, the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function is called with the necessary arguments to avoid the `TypeError` that was occurring previously.
