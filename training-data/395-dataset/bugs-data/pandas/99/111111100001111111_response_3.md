The error occurred due to the function's inability to handle the input of type 'IntegerArray', resulting in a TypeError. The problematic function seems to be `_convert_listlike_datetimes` as it checks for specific types and then tries to operate on them. 

The bug occurs because the function does not have explicit handling for 'IntegerArray' type. The function seems to be dealing with different input formats and types, but it lacks a specific condition to handle 'IntegerArray'.

To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional block to handle the 'IntegerArray' input type. This block should convert the 'IntegerArray' to a suitable format for further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
        arg,
        format,
        name=None,
        tz=None,
        unit=None,
        errors=None,
        infer_datetime_format=None,
        dayfirst=None,
        yearfirst=None,
        exact=None,
    ):
        from pandas import DatetimeIndex
        from pandas.api.types import is_integer_array

        if is_integer_array(arg):
            arg = arg.to_numpy()  # Convert IntegerArray to numpy array

        # Existing code below...
        # (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
``` 

By adding the conditional block to check for 'IntegerArray' and converting it to a numpy array, we provide explicit handling for this data type, thereby fixing the bug.
