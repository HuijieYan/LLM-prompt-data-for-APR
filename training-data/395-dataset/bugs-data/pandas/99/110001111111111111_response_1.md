The error occurs in the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function, which is called within the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function. The error message indicates that the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function should receive at least 3 positional arguments, but only 2 were given.

The problem arises from the fact that the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function is expecting at least 3 positional arguments, but it is only receiving 2. This mismatch in the number of arguments causes the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function within the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function should be called with the correct number of arguments. The source of the issue might be that the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function is not being provided with the necessary arguments (e.g., it might be missing the third positional argument).

Here's the corrected code for the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    if unit is not None:
        if format is not None:
            raise ValueError("cannot specify both format and unit")
        arg = getattr(arg, "values", arg)
        # Call array_with_unit_to_datetime with all required arguments
        result, tz_parsed = tslib.array_with_unit_to_datetime(arg, unit, tz, errors=errors)
        # rest of the function remains the same
```

By ensuring that the `array_with_unit_to_datetime` function is called with all the required arguments, we can address the TypeError that was occurring. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
