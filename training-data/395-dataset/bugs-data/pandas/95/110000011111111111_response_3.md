The error occurs during the test `test_eq_integer_disallowed` where the `assert_numpy_array_equal` function fails to assert the equality of the expected and actual results. The expected result is `np.array([False, False, False])` while the actual result is `np.array([True, True, False])`. This indicates that the comparison operation (`==`) is not functioning correctly.

The potential error location within the `_period_array_cmp` function is likely in the `wrapper` function where the comparison of Period-like objects is being handled.

The bug is occurring because the function is not correctly handling comparisons between `PeriodIndex` and integer values as shown in the test case. The function is not properly checking for the type of `other` and hence, it's not being handled appropriately leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly check the type of `other` and handle the comparison accordingly. It should also ensure that comparisons between `PeriodIndex` and integer values raise a `TypeError` as indicated in the test case.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, (int, Period)):
            return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        else:
            if isinstance(other, int):
                raise TypeError("Comparison with integer values is not allowed")

            # Handle comparison between other Period-like objects
            result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))

            if self._hasnans:
                result[self._isnan] = nat_result

            return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check if `other` is an instance of `int` or `Period`. If it is an integer, we raise a `TypeError`. Otherwise, we handle the comparison between `self` and `other` Period-like objects appropriately and return the result. This ensures that comparisons with integer values raise a `TypeError` as expected in the test case, and handles the comparison between `PeriodIndex` and Period-like objects correctly.
