The error message shows that the `assert_numpy_array_equal` function in the test case is failing because the expected and result arrays are different.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_period_array_cmp` method, specifically in the section where it handles the comparison between the `PeriodIndex` and an integer (`other`). This handling seems to be causing the error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `_period_array_cmp` method incorrectly handles comparison between `PeriodIndex` and an integer. It fails to match the expected behavior of Period semantics by treating integers as Periods. This leads to the incorrect comparison result, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `_period_array_cmp` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the comparison between `PeriodIndex` and integers by following the expected behavior of Period semantics.

Below is the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` method:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq).ordinal

        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

This corrected code properly handles the comparison between `PeriodIndex` and an integer, converting the integer to a `Period` and then proceeding with the comparison.
