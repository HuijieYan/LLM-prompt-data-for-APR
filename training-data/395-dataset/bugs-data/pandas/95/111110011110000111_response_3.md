The test case named `test_eq_integer_disallowed` intends to verify that certain comparison operations with integers will raise a `TypeError` with the given `PeriodIndex` object. The error message shows that the comparison operation `idx == other` is producing `result` as `[True, True, False]`, while `expected` is `[False, False, False]`, leading to a failed assertion.

The issue seems to be within the `wrapper` function of the `_period_array_cmp` method. The `wrapper` function seems to have some conditional checks and comparison logic for different types of input (`int`, `str`, or other types like `np.ndarray`). This logic appears to be incorrectly handling the comparison with `int` type, which is causing the failure in the test case.

The bug occurs because the conditional checks for handling `int` type inputs is not correctly implemented. When the `other` input is an integer, the function does not correctly handle the comparison logic and return a result that is not as expected.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and comparison logic for handling `int` type inputs need to be revised to align with the behavior intended by the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` method:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # For integer input, we want to return a result based on comparison with the ordinal value
            # Create a new Period object with the integer value and the same frequency as self
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)

        elif isinstance(other, self._recognized_scalars) or other is NaT:
            other = self._scalar_type(other)
            self._check_compatible_with(other)

            other_i8 = self._unbox_scalar(other)

            result = op(self.view("i8"), other_i8)
            if isna(other):
                result.fill(nat_result)

        # ... (other conditional checks remain unchanged)

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

This corrected code should handle the comparison with integers correctly, as intended by the test case.
