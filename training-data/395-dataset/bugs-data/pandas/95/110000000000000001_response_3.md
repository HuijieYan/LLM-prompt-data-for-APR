The potential error in the function is that there are multiple instances of 'op' being used without being defined. The function is trying to use 'op' in several operations, such as 'opname == "__ne__"', 'ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)', and 'result = op(self.view("i8"), other_i8)', without defining 'op' before using it.

This can create a bug because the function is referring to 'op' without it being explicitly passed as an argument or defined within the function, which can result in a NameError or incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, 'op' should be properly defined within the function as an argument, and all references to 'op' should use the passed argument.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other, op=op):  # Define op as an argument
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # TODO: sure we want to allow this?  we dont for DTA/TDA
            #  2 tests rely on this
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged with appropriate usage of the 'op' argument

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```
