The test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed` is testing the behavior of comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer value. The expected behavior is that integers are not treated as Periods, so the comparison should raise a TypeError. 

The error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison operation. It seems that the comparison operation is returning an array with unexpected values, leading to the assertion error.

Upon analyzing the `wrapper` function inside the `_period_array_cmp` function, it is apparent that this is the location of the bug. The function is overly complex and has multiple conditionals that might not be handling the comparison cases correctly.

The bug occurs because the comparison operation in the `wrapper` function does not handle the case where `other` is an integer correctly. The code does not enforce the behavior of raising a TypeError when comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer.

To fix the bug, the `wrapper` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `other` is an integer and enforce raising a TypeError. Additionally, the comparison logic for other data types should be reviewed to ensure correctness.

Below is the corrected code for the `wrapper` function in the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            raise TypeError("Comparison of PeriodIndex with integer not allowed")

        # ... (additional comparison logic for other data types)

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

This modification ensures that when the `wrapper` function receives an integer as `other`, it raises a TypeError as expected. Other comparison logic for different data types should also be reviewed and handled accordingly.
