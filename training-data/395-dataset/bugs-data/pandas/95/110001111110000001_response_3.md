The error occurs in the function `_period_array_cmp` where there is an issue with the comparison operation, specifically when comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer value, as highlighted in the test `test_eq_integer_disallowed`.

The reason for the bug is that the `_period_array_cmp` function doesn't handle the comparison of a `PeriodIndex` with an integer value properly. It is comparing the `PeriodIndex` directly with the integer value without considering the semantics of comparisons involving `Periods`. This results in incorrect comparison results and the assertion failure in the test case.

To fix this bug, the `_period_array_cmp` function should be updated to handle the comparison of `PeriodIndex` with different types of input values, including integers. It should consider the semantics of comparisons involving periods and handle integer values properly as specified by the test.

The corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
        
        # Rest of the comparison logic remains unchanged
        
    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, we first handle the case when `other` is an integer by converting it to a `Period`. This aligns with the semantics of comparisons involving `Periods`. The rest of the comparison logic that follows remains the same, ensuring that all comparison cases are handled appropriately.
