The test function `test_eq_integer_disallowed` is comparing a `PeriodIndex` object `idx` with different types of `other` objects, including integer, list, numpy array, and Pandas Index. The test case expects a specific behavior when comparing the `PeriodIndex` with an integer, and it asserts the result against an expected array.

The error occurs because the comparison operation between the `PeriodIndex` and an integer is not producing the expected result. This indicates that the `_period_array_cmp` function is not correctly handling the comparison with an integer.

The potential error location within the `_period_array_cmp` function is when the `wrapper` function is comparing the `PeriodIndex` with an integer. This comparison is not producing the expected result, leading to failing test assertions.

The bug occurs because the `wrapper` function is not adequately handling the comparison with an integer. It is attempting to compare the `PeriodIndex` with other types of objects, such as strings, integers, and arrays. However, the logic for handling the comparison with an integer is incorrect, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the `wrapper` function should be modified to handle the comparison with an integer correctly. It should check the type of `other` and if it is an integer, it should treat it as a `Period` with the same frequency as the `PeriodIndex` and perform the comparison accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
        """
        Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
        """
        opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
        nat_result = opname == "__ne__"
    
        @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
        def wrapper(self, other):
            if isinstance(other, int):
                other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
                ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)
                result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)
            else:
                ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)
                # Rest of the code remains as it is for handling string, recognized scalars, etc.
```

By checking the type of `other` and handling the comparison with an integer separately from other types, the corrected code ensures that the comparison behaves as expected in the test case.
