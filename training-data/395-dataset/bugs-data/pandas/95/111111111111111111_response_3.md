The buggy function `_period_array_cmp` is attempting to compare a `PeriodIndex` with an integer in the test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed`. The function is trying to handle different types of comparison operations such as equality (`__eq__`), inequality (`__ne__`), less than (`__lt__`), greater than (`__gt__`), less than or equal to (`__le__`), and greater than or equal to (`__ge__`). However, there are several issues in the function:

1. The function is not handling the comparison of `PeriodIndex` with an integer correctly.
2. It is also trying to handle string comparisons, but the code is convoluted and not performing the intended operations.

The error message indicates that the comparison for equality (`==`) is failing, and the expected and resulting arrays have different values. This reflects the issue in the function's handling of the comparison operations.

To fix the bug, you can simplify the code and handle the comparison of `PeriodIndex` with an integer separately. Additionally, you should remove the convoluted logic for handling string comparisons and focus on comparing `PeriodIndex` objects.

Below is the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    def wrapper(self, other):
        # Handle comparison with integers
        if isinstance(other, (int, np.integer)):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = getattr(self.asi8, opname)(other.ordinal)
        else:
            # Handle comparison with PeriodIndex
            if not isinstance(other, PeriodIndex):
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

            self._check_compatible_with(other)

            # Perform the comparison
            result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))
            if nat_result:
                result[self.isna() | other.isna()] = True

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, the function wrapper now properly handles comparisons between `PeriodIndex` and integers as well as `PeriodIndex` objects. The function has been simplified to only handle these cases and provide clear and straightforward logic for the comparison operations.
