The bug seems to be occurring in the `_period_array_cmp` function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison of the `PeriodIndex` with the integer value 2017, specifically when using the `==` operator.

The issue likely arises from the function's handling of comparisons with integers. The function is designed to handle comparison operations with `Period` objects, but it seems to be incorrectly validating comparisons with integer values.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle comparisons with integer values and raise a `TypeError` as specified in the test function. This can be achieved by adding a check for the type of the `other` value and raising a `TypeError` if it is an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int):
            raise TypeError("Comparison with integers is not supported")

        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)
        # existing code for handling comparisons with Period objects
        # ...

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

By making this change, the function should correctly raise a `TypeError` when attempting to compare `PeriodIndex` with an integer, as expected in the test case. This will resolve the bug and the comparison operations will behave as intended.
