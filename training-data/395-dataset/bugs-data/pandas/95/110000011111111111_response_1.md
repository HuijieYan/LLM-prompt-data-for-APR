The error occurs in the `_period_array_cmp` function, specifically the `wrapper` inner function. The bug causes incorrect comparison results, which leads to a failed test case.

The issue occurs when checking for the integer type in the `wrapper` function. If the `other` parameter is an integer, it creates a `Period` type object using that integer, and then proceeds with the comparisons. This behavior deviates from the expected behavior as per the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the case where the `other` parameter is an integer. Instead of creating a `Period` type object using the integer value, we should directly return a `False` value, as an integer should not be treated as a `Period` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, int):
            return False  # Treat integers as False for comparison

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        
        # remaining code remains unchanged
        ...
    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, the conditional block for handling the integer type directly returns `False`, indicating that the comparison should result in `False` when the `other` parameter is an integer. This aligns with the expected behavior as per the test case and resolves the bug.
