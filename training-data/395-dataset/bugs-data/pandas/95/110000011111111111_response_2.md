The bug in the provided function `_period_array_cmp` seems to be related to the comparison operations and handling the input values. The function is designed to wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like values to PeriodDtype.

Looking at the test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed`, it appears that the comparison operation (==) is not working as expected when comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer value.

The potential error location within the `_period_array_cmp` function could be in the conditional checks and operations related to comparing `Period` values with integers.

The bug occurs because the function does not appropriately handle comparison operations between `PeriodIndex` objects and integer values. It seems that the function should be modified to handle such comparisons specifically for the `Period` datatype.

To fix the bug:
1. Identify the data type of the "other" parameter in the `_period_array_cmp` function.
2. Add a conditional check to handle comparisons specifically for the `Period` datatype and integers.
3. Update the comparison operations to appropriately handle the input data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        elif isinstance(other, (int, np.integer)):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)

        # rest of the existing code for handling comparison operations with recognized scalars, lists, and arrays
        # ...

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

The above correction includes adding a conditional block to handle comparisons with integer values. The `elif` block checks if the "other" parameter is an integer (or numpy integer) and converts it into a `Period` object before performing the comparison operation. This modification should resolve the bug related to comparisons of `PeriodIndex` objects with integer values.
