The error in the provided function seems to arise from the attempt to compare a Period-like object with another object using comparison operators. The function is designed to wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like objects to PeriodDtype, but it has several conditions and checks that lead to the function being overly complex and difficult to understand.

The bug appears to be related to the incorrect handling of comparison operations with Period-like objects. The code attempts to convert the other object to a Period object with a default frequency when the other object is an integer, and then performs the comparison. However, this approach may not be necessary and can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing Period-like objects.

To fix the bug, we need to simplify the comparison logic and remove unnecessary checks that complicate the function. Additionally, we should ensure that comparisons are made directly between Period-like objects without unnecessary conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    def wrapper(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, cls):
            return NotImplemented

        result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result
        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In this corrected code, we directly compare the Period-like objects without unnecessary conversions or checks. This simplifies the logic and removes the potential for unexpected behavior when comparing objects.
