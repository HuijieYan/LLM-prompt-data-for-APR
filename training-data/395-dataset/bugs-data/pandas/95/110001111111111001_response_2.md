The error message indicates that the comparison between the PeriodIndex and an integer is resulting in unexpected behavior, with the `assert_numpy_array_equal` function detecting differences in the array values.

The potential error location within the function is in the `_period_array_cmp` method, specifically in the `wrapper` function defined within it. The comparison operations seem to be the source of the issue, where the integer is not being handled as expected resulting in the unexpected output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison operations within the `wrapper` function are not handling the case where the input `other` is an integer as expected.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the `wrapper` function to handle the case where `other` is an integer and ensure it behaves according to the expected Period semantics.

The corrected code for the `wrapper` function within the `_period_array_cmp` method will be as follows:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
        """
        Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
        """
        opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
        nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

        @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
        def wrapper(self, other):
            if isinstance(other, int):
                other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

            result = getattr(self.asi8, opname)(other.ordinal) if isinstance(other, Period) else self._invalid_comparison(self, other, opname)

            return result

        return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In this corrected code, the conditional check has been added for handling the case when `other` is an integer. If `other` is an integer, it is converted to a `Period` object before performing the comparison. If the input is not a `Period` object, then the `_invalid_comparison` method is called, assuming it is defined elsewhere to handle the invalid comparison case.
