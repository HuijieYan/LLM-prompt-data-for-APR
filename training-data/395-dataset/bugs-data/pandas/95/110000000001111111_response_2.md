The bug in the given function seems to be related to the comparison operations for Period-like objects. The function is designed to wrap comparison operations, but there are several issues in the code that need to be addressed.

The potential error might occur within the `wrapper` function. The code seems to be trying to handle different types of comparisons and input types, but the logic is convoluted and may lead to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs due to the complex and unclear logic in the `wrapper` function, leading to potential mishandling of different comparison scenarios.

To fix the bug, the `wrapper` function should be simplified and refactored to handle each comparison operation separately. Additionally, the handling of different input types and scenarios should be made explicit and clear to avoid unexpected behavior.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if op.__name__ in ["__eq__", "__ne__"]:
            # Handle equality and inequality comparisons
            if isinstance(other, str):
                try:
                    other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
                except ValueError:
                    # string that can't be parsed as Period
                    return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
            elif isinstance(other, int):
                other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

            result = op(self.asi8, other.asi8)
            if isna(other):
                result.fill(op.__name__ == "__ne__")
        else:
            if not isinstance(other, (np.ndarray, cls)):
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
            
            other_i8 = self._unbox_scalar(other)
            result = op(self.view("i8"), other_i8)
            if isna(other):
                result.fill(False)

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = op.__name__ == "__ne__"

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, f"__{op.__name__}__", cls)
```

In the corrected code, the `wrapper` function is simplified and refactored to handle specific cases for equality and inequality comparisons separately. This approach makes the logic clearer and reduces the potential for unexpected behavior. Additionally, the handling of different input types and scenarios is made more explicit to improve code clarity and maintainability.
