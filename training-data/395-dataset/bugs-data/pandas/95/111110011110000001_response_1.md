The error occurs when the test function `test_eq_integer_disallowed` in the file `test_period.py` is executed. This test case uses the `==` operator to compare a PeriodIndex with an integer (2017) and then checks for equality between the result and an expected array. The error message indicates that the result and expected array have different values. This is due to the incorrect behavior of the `==` operator when comparing a PeriodIndex with an integer.

The potential error location within the `_period_array_cmp` function is the comparison between the `idx` and `other` variables. This line of code is responsible for comparing the PeriodIndex with the integer value (2017) passed to the test function.

The bug occurs because the `wrapper` function does not handle the case where the `other` variable is an integer correctly. As a result, erroneous comparisons are made when `other` is an integer, leading to the incorrect results observed in the test function.

To fix the bug, the `wrapper` function should be modified to handle integer comparisons correctly. This involves implementing a separate branch for integer comparison and applying the correct comparison logic for the PeriodIndex and integer values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # Handling integer comparison correctly
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)
        elif isinstance(other, self._recognized_scalars) or other is NaT:
            other = self._scalar_type(other)
            self._check_compatible_with(other)
            other_i8 = self._unbox_scalar(other)

            result = op(self.view("i8"), other_i8)
            if isna(other):
                result.fill(nat_result)
        # ... (rest of the function unchanged)

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

With the corrected `wrapper` function, the comparison between the `PeriodIndex` and an integer (2017) will be handled correctly, and the test case should succeed without errors.
