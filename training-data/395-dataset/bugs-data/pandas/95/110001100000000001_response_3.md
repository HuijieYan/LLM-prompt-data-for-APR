The potential error in the function `_period_array_cmp` seems to be in the way the comparison operations are being handled with different types of input (`str`, `int`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, etc.). The code currently contains a mix of different types of comparisons and error handling, which is leading to a buggy behavior.

The bug is likely occurring due to the inconsistent handling of different types of input for comparison operations. The code currently tries to handle strings, integers, lists, and numpy arrays differently, resulting in potential issues with the comparisons and error handling.

To fix this bug, the function should be refactored to handle different types of input consistently. It should also include proper error handling and type checking to ensure that the comparisons are being performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        self_array = self.view('datetime64[D]')
        if isinstance(other, (str, int)):
            other = pd.Period(other, freq=self.freq)
        elif isinstance(other, (list, np.ndarray)):
            other = pd.PeriodIndex(other, freq=self.freq)

        if not isinstance(other, (pd.Period, pd.PeriodIndex)):
            return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        result = op(self_array, other)

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, we create a new `self_array` variable by converting `self` to a `datetime64[D]` array using the `view` method. Then, regardless of the input type for `other`, we convert it to either a `pd.Period` or a `pd.PeriodIndex` object. This ensures that the comparison is consistent and handles different input types properly. Finally, we perform the comparison using the converted `self` and `other` objects.
