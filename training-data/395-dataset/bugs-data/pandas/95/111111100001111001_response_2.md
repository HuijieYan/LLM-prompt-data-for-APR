The bug is likely located in the `_period_array_cmp` function. This function is supposed to wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype. The bug might be related to the comparison operations themselves or the handling of different data types.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the incorrect conversion or handling of `op.__name__` and the subsequent operations based on its value.

To fix the bug, ensure that the comparison operations are correctly handled for different input types and that the appropriate method is called based on the comparison operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    def wrapper(self, other):
        if opname in ("__eq__", "__ne__", "__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"):
            if isinstance(other, str):
                try:
                    other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
                except ValueError:
                    return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
            elif isinstance(other, int):
                other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)

            if isinstance(other, self._recognized_scalars) or other is NaT:
                other = self._scalar_type(other)
                self._check_compatible_with(other)

                other_i8 = self._unbox_scalar(other)

                result = op(self.view("i8"), other_i8)
                if isna(other):
                    result.fill(nat_result)

            elif not is_list_like(other):
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

            elif len(other) != len(self):
                raise ValueError("Lengths must match")

            else:
                if isinstance(other, list):
                    other = np.array(other)

                if not isinstance(other, (np.ndarray, cls)):
                    return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

                if is_object_dtype(other):
                    with np.errstate(all="ignore"):
                        result = ops.comp_method_OBJECT_ARRAY(
                            op, self.astype(object), other
                        )
                    o_mask = isna(other)

                elif not cls._is_recognized_dtype(other.dtype):
                    return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

                else:
                    assert isinstance(other, cls), type(other)

                    self._check_compatible_with(other)

                    result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))
                    o_mask = other._isnan

                if o_mask.any():
                    result[o_mask] = nat_result

            if self._hasnans:
                result[self._isnan] = nat_result

            return result
        else:
            return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

This corrected code ensures that the comparison operations are correctly handled and that the appropriate method is called based on the comparison operation. It also includes the necessary checks and conversions for different input types.
