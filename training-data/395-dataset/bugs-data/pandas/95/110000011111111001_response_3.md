The error occurs in the `wrapper` function within the `_period_array_cmp` method. This function deals with comparison operations involving Period-like objects and conversion to PeriodDtype. The bug seems to be related to how comparison operations are handled, resulting in incorrect comparison results.

The test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed` is supposed to check that integers are not treated as Periods. However, due to the bug in the comparison operations, the comparison results are incorrect, leading to the assertion error in the test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for handling comparison operations and ensure that it correctly distinguishes between Periods and integers.
2. Verify that the `wrapper` function correctly performs comparison operations and handles different types of input.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` method:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, cls):
            if isinstance(other, Period) or np.issubdtype(type(other), np.integer):
                other_i8 = other.ordinal
                result = op(self.view("i8"), other_i8)
                if isna(other):
                    result.fill(nat_result)
            else:
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif is_list_like(other):
            other = np.array(other, dtype="int64")
            result = op(self.view("i8"), other)
            if isna(other).any():
                result[isna(other)] = nat_result
        else:
            return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

This corrected code includes explicit checks for comparing Periods with integers and uses the `ordinal` attribute to perform the comparison. Additionally, a check for list-like input is added to handle comparisons with an array of integers. The logic ensures that comparisons between Periods and non-Periods yield correct results, addressing the issue observed in the test case.
