The potential error in the `_period_array_cmp` function is that it is not properly handling comparison operations between `Period`-like objects and `PeriodDtype`. The function is trying to compare different types of objects and is not handling each case correctly.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to compare different types of data without handling each type properly. This leads to potential errors and inconsistencies in the comparison operations.

To fix the bug, the function should handle each type of comparison separately and make sure to properly convert and compare the objects as needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_period_array_cmp` function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, (str, int)):
            other = pd.Period(other, freq=self.freq)
        
        if isinstance(other, pd.Period) or pd.isna(other):
            self._check_compatible_with(other)

            result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))

            if pd.isna(other):
                result.fill(nat_result)

        elif isinstance(other, (np.ndarray, pd.PeriodDtype)):
            self._check_compatible_with(other)

            result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))

            if pd.isna(other).any():
                result[pd.isna(other)] = nat_result

        elif pd.is_list_like(other):
            if len(other) != len(self):
                raise ValueError("Lengths must match")
            elif isinstance(other, list) or not isinstance(other, (np.ndarray, pd.PeriodDtype)):
                other = np.array(other)

                with np.errstate(all="ignore"):
                    result = ops.comp_method_OBJECT_ARRAY(op, self.astype(object), other)
                o_mask = pd.isna(other)

                if o_mask.any():
                    result[o_mask] = nat_result

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, we handle each type of comparison separately and ensure that the objects are properly converted and compared as needed.
