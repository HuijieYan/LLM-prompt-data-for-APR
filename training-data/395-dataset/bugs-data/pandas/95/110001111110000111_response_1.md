1. The test case is testing the equality comparison of a PeriodIndex object with an integer (2017) and several other data types. The expected result for the integer comparison is an array of boolean values.

2. The potential error location is the `_period_array_cmp` method, specifically in the `wrapper` function that is defined within it.

3. The error occurs because the comparison operation is not handling the case when `other` is an integer correctly. This results in the incorrect comparison results and the assertion error in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, the comparison operation should explicitly handle the case when `other` is an integer and ensure that the comparison with `Period` objects is performed correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `wrapper` function within the `_period_array_cmp` method:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # comparing with an integer
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)

        # the rest of the comparison operations for other data types...

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, a case for comparing with an integer `other` has been explicitly handled, and a `Period` object is created for the integer to perform the comparison.
