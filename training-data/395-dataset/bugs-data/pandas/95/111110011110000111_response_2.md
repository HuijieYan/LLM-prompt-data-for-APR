The test function is testing the equality comparison of a PeriodIndex with different types of input values, including an integer value 2017.

The error message indicates that the equality comparison (==) between the PeriodIndex and the integer value 2017 is resulting in the wrong array of boolean values. The expected result is [False, False, False], but the actual result is [True, True, False]. This suggests that there is a bug in the comparison logic for the PeriodIndex and integer values.

Looking at the _period_array_cmp function, it appears that the bug might be related to how integer values are handled inside the conditional block that checks if the input is an integer.

One possible reason for the bug could be that the logic inside the conditional block dealing with integer values is not properly converting the integer to a Period and performing the comparison.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the conditional block for integer comparison needs to be re-evaluated and corrected. It should ensure that the integer value is properly converted to a Period before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the _period_array_cmp function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        ordinal_op = getattr(self.asi8, opname)

        if isinstance(other, str):
            try:
                other = self._scalar_from_string(other)
            except ValueError:
                # string that can't be parsed as Period
                return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)
        elif isinstance(other, int):
            # Convert integer to Period
            other = pd.Period(other, freq=self.freq)
            result = ordinal_op(other.ordinal)

        if isinstance(other, self._recognized_scalars) or other is NaT:
            other = self._scalar_type(other)
            self._check_compatible_with(other)

            other_i8 = self._unbox_scalar(other)

            result = op(self.view("i8"), other_i8)
            if isna(other):
                result.fill(nat_result)

        # Rest of the function remains the same

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, when the input is an integer, we convert the integer value to a Period using pd.Period() and then perform the comparison using the ordinal values as needed.
