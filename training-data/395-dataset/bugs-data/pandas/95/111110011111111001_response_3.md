The error message in the test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed` indicates that the comparison between the PeriodIndex `idx` and the integer `other` is resulting in unexpected output. The code is attempting to compare the PeriodIndex with an integer for equality. 

The potential error location within the `_period_array_cmp` function is when it checks for the type of `other` and performs comparisons based on its type. This might lead to unexpected behavior when comparing with integers.

The bug is occurring because the function is designed to handle comparisons with other Period-like objects, but the test case is trying to compare PeriodIndex with an integer. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to explicitly check for the type of `other` and return a TypeError when comparing with an integer instead of trying to handle such cases. 

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, (int, np.integer)):
            raise TypeError(f"Invalid comparison between PeriodIndex and integer")
        
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...
```

With this correction, the code will explicitly check for the type of `other` and raise a TypeError when comparing with an integer, as demonstrated in the test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed`.
