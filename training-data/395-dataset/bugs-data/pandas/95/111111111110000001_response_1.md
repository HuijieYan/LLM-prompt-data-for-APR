The test case `test_eq_integer_disallowed` is designed to check the behavior of the `==` operator when used with a PeriodIndex and integers. The function `tm.assert_numpy_array_equal(result, expected)` is failing, indicating that the comparison is not being performed as expected.

The potential error location in the `buggy function` is within the `_period_array_cmp` function, specifically within the `wrapper` function where the comparison operations are being handled.

The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrect handling of comparisons between PeriodIndex and integers within the `wrapper` function. The code is trying to handle comparisons between PeriodIndex and various data types, including integers. However, it seems that the integer comparison is not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, the comparison operation between the `PeriodIndex` and integers needs to be handled correctly. The code should not treat integers as `Periods` and should raise a `TypeError` when comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def wrapper(self, other):
        # raise TypeError when comparing PeriodIndex with an integer
        if isinstance(other, int):
            raise TypeError("Comparison between PeriodIndex and integers is not allowed")
        
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...
    
    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

In the corrected code, a check has been added in the `wrapper` function to raise a `TypeError` when comparing a `PeriodIndex` with an integer, in line with the test case expectations.
