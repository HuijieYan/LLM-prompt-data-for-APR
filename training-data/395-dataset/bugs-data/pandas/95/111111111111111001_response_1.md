The test case is checking for the equality of a PeriodIndex with an integer (2017) and expecting it to raise a TypeError, but it's actually returning an array of boolean values. This suggests that the comparison operation within the function `_period_array_cmp` is not handling the input cases correctly.

The possible error location within the problematic function `_period_array_cmp` could be in the `wrapper` function. It seems that the handling of comparison operations for different types (integer, string, etc.) is not being done correctly, leading to unexpected results.

The bug occurs because the comparison operations within the `wrapper` function are not properly handling the input types and values. As a result, the comparison between PeriodIndex and an integer is not raising the expected TypeError and is returning an array of boolean values instead.

To fix the bug, the `wrapper` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the comparison operations for different input types, such as integers and strings.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_period_array_cmp`:

```python
def _period_array_cmp(cls, op):
    """
    Wrap comparison operations to convert Period-like to PeriodDtype
    """
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"
    nat_result = opname == "__ne__"

    def wrapper(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, int) or isinstance(other, str):
            other = Period(other, freq=self.freq)  # Convert int or str to Period
        elif isinstance(other, (np.ndarray, cls)):
            if is_object_dtype(other):
                with np.errstate(all="ignore"):
                    result = ops.comp_method_OBJECT_ARRAY(op, self.astype(object), other)
                o_mask = isna(other)
            else:
                assert isinstance(other, cls), type(other)
                self._check_compatible_with(other)
                result = op(self.view("i8"), other.view("i8"))
                o_mask = other._isnan

            if o_mask.any():
                result[o_mask] = nat_result
        else:
            return invalid_comparison(self, other, op)

        if self._hasnans:
            result[self._isnan] = nat_result

        return result

    return compat.set_function_name(wrapper, opname, cls)
```

With this corrected code, the comparison operations for different input types (integers, strings, etc.) are properly handled within the `wrapper` function. This should ensure that comparisons between PeriodIndex and other types return the expected results and raise the TypeError when appropriate.
