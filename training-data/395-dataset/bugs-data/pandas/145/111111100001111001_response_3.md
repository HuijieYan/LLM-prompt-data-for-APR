The buggy function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the operations for different data types and inputs correctly. It has multiple if-else branches handling different cases, such as scalar inputs, DataFrame or Series inputs, and specific handling for row-by-row or column-by-column operations.

Based on the buggy case inputs and the expected variable values and types, the issue seems to be with the way the `right` and `left` input data are being handled within the `column_op` function. Currently, it seems to be accessing columns and rows incorrectly, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `column_op` function correctly handles the different cases based on the input types (scalar, DataFrame, or Series) and performs the corresponding operation for each column. This can be achieved using appropriate checks and logical control flow within the `column_op` function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    import pandas as pd

    right = pd.lib.item_from_zerodim(right)

    if pd.lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        if isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
            assert right._indexed_same(left)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == "columns":
            # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
            # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

        elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
            raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function uses proper nested if-else statements to handle different input types (scalar, DataFrame, and Series) and operates on the DataFrame columns based on the specified function and input data. The error handling and checks for input types and compatibility have been improved to handle various possible cases effectively.
