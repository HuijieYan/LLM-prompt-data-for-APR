The error message indicates that when the function `dispatch_to_series` is called with the `df * ser` operation, it encounters a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`. This means that there is an issue with the multiplication operation between the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser` which contains NaT (Not a Time) values.

The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to how it handles operations involving NaT values. The function fails to handle the case when a Series with NaT values is being used in arithmetic operations with a DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we can modify the way the function processes the input data when it encounters a Series with NaT values. Specifically, we should handle the NaT values in a way that ensures the arithmetic operations between the DataFrame and Series are properly handled, returning the expected output.

The corrected function for `dispatch_to_series` is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # handle the case when right is a Series with NaT values
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        right = right.where(~right.isnull(), None)

    # rest of the function implementation remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected function, we use the `where` method to replace the NaT values in the Series with `None`, ensuring that the arithmetic operations with the DataFrame are handled correctly.
