The error occurs when the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting` tries to perform element-wise multiplication between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The error message indicates that the bug might be located in the function `dispatch_to_series()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `dispatch_to_series()` function fails to handle the operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. The bug occurs when trying to perform the element-wise operation between `xrav[mask]` (an array from the DataFrame) and `y` (the NaT value).

To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `dispatch_to_series()` function needs to be updated to handle the case where the operation is performed between a DataFrame and a Series containing NaT values. This can be achieved by properly handling and checking for the presence of NaT values.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series()` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    import numpy as np
    from pandas.core.arrays import NaTType

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, NaTType):
                return {i: np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
In the updated code, when a Series containing NaT values is encountered, it checks for the presence of NaT and handles it by returning NaN for the relevant columns in the DataFrame.
