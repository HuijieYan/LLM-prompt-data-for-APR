The error occurs in the `dispatch_to_series` function, specifically in the `column_op` nested functions. The issue seems to be related to the handling of `NaT` (Not a Time) values in the `column_op` implementation.

The error message indicates that the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` is raised when trying to perform the multiplication operation between an array and `NaTType`, which is not supported.

One approach to fixing this bug is to explicitly handle the case where one of the operands is `NaTType` within the `column_op` implementation. This could involve checking for `NaT` values and handling those cases separately to avoid unsupported operand type errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        if pd.isna(b):
            # Handle the case where b is NaT
            return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function first checks if the second operand `b` is `NaT` using `pd.isna(b)`. If it is `NaT`, it returns a dictionary with `NaT` values for all columns. Otherwise, it performs the operation between `a` and `b` as before.
