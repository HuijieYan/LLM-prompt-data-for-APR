The provided error message indicates that the problem occurs when the function tries to perform the operation `op(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i])` where `b` is a Series with NaT (Not a Time) values. This operation causes a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` due to the unsupported multiplication operation between a NumPy array and NaT.

The issue is caused by attempting to apply a binary operation between a NumPy array and NaT, which is not supported. To fix this, the function should handle the case where the right operand (`b`) contains NaT values and adjust the operation accordingly.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `column_op` function inside the `dispatch_to_series` function. Specifically, for the case when the right operand (`b`) contains NaT values, the function should skip the operation and directly return the original left DataFrame. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when trying to perform unsupported operations involving NaT values.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
