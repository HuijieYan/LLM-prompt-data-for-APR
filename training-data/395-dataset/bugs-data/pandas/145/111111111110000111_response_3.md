The error occurs when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with a DataFrame and a Series containing "NaT" values. The function is trying to perform the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series, resulting in a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'.

The bug is located within the `column_op` function. When the `right` operand is a scalar or a DataFrame, the function incorrectly tries to perform the operation with `np.arange()` on each column of the DataFrame. This causes issues when the `right` operand contains NaT values.

To fix this bug, the `column_op` function should properly handle the case when the `right` operand is a scalar or a DataFrame and avoid using `np.arange()` with the columns in those scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return func(a, b)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```
