It seems that the error is occurring when the `dispatch_to_series` function is called with the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser`. The multiplication operation is failing due to an unsupported operand type for the multiplication (*).

The potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely in the `column_op` function definitions, specifically when handling the case of the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the code is not handling the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing timedelta64(NaT) values properly, leading to an unsupported operand type error.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition in the `column_op` function that specifically checks for timedelta64(NaT) values and handles them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
from pandas.core.common import lib

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.DataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[0]) else b.iloc[0] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function now includes checks for the `timedelta64(NaT)` values and handles them accordingly so that the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing `timedelta64(NaT)` values is properly handled.
