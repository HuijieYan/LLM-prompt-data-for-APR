The bug in this code is that the `column_op` function is being redefined multiple times within the `dispatch_to_series` function. This redefinition could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `column_op` function should be defined outside the `dispatch_to_series` function, and then called within it.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def column_op(left, right, func):
    return {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right) for i in range(len(left.columns))}

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        result = column_op(left, right, func)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        result = column_op(left, right, func)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        result = {i: func(left.iloc[:, i], right.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(left.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        result = column_op(left, right, func)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(result, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function is defined outside of `dispatch_to_series` and called when needed within the function. This avoids the redefinition of `column_op` and ensures that the expected behavior is maintained.
