The error is likely caused by the `right` variable being a Series and not handling all possible cases correctly. The function uses different methods for handling different types of input based on whether `right` is a scalar, a DataFrame, or a Series. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the Series input case and execute the arithmetic or comparison operation as expected.

The corrected code for the problematic function `dispatch_to_series` is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    new_data = None
    
    if isinstance(right, pd.Series):  # Handle the input being a Series
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    return new_data
```

This corrected function now handles the input of a Series properly based on the specified axis. It first checks if `right` is a Series and then applies the function `func` to the DataFrame `left` with proper indexes and columns alignment.
