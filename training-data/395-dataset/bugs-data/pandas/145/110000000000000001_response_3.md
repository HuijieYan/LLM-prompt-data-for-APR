Potential error location: The potential error in the function is in the column_op functions where the logic for dispatching to the Series implementation is defined based on the type of 'right' argument.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the logic for dispatching to the Series implementation is not correctly handling all possible types of 'right' arguments such as scalar, DataFrame, and Series.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by modifying the column_op functions to correctly handle all possible types of 'right' arguments, ensuring that the appropriate operation is performed based on the type of 'right' argument.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.computation.expressions import evaluate
from pandas.core.common import item_from_zerodim, is_scalar, _not_none, lib
from pandas.core.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
