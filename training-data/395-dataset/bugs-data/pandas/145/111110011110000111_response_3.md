The error message occurs when the test function test_td64_op_nat_casting tries to perform the operation df * ser, where df is a DataFrame and ser is a Series containing timedelta64 values with NaT (Not a Time) values. The error message indicates that the system is trying to perform the operation with unsupported operand types for multiplication.

The potential error location within the dispatch_to_series function might be in the part where it attempts to apply the function func to elements of the DataFrame and the Series.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the dispatch_to_series function does not handle the NaT values appropriately when applying the arithmetic operation.

To fix this bug, you can modify the dispatch_to_series function to handle the NaT values by checking for them and treating them as special cases.

Here's the corrected code for the dispatch_to_series function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b) else b}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns)) if not pd.isna(b)}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, special handling for the NaT values is added within the column_op function for the cases where right is a scalar or a Series. This change ensures that the operation is performed appropriately when encountering NaT values.
