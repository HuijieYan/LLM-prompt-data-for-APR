The error occurs due to the presence of NaT (Not a Time) value in the series 'ser'. The bug can be attributed to the use of NaT in the arithmetic operation which is not valid and results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the column_op function within the buggy function to handle the operation when `b` contains NaT values.

The corrected code for the problematic function 'dispatch_to_series' is as follows:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if np.issubdtype(b.dtype, np.datetime64):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: a.iloc[:, i].combine(b, func) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, we have introduced a condition within the `column_op` function to handle the case when the `b` variable contains NaT values. If `b` contains NaT values and is of type `np.datetime64`, then the operation `func(a.iloc[:, i], b)` is performed for each column `i`. Otherwise, we use the `combine` method to apply the operation element-wise between each column and the series `b`. This ensures that the bug related to NaT values is fixed and the function now handles such cases appropriately.
