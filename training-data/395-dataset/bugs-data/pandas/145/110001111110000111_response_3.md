The error occurs during the execution of the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` test case. This test case attempts to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series object. The error message indicates that the multiplication operation fails due to an unsupported operand type for multiplication between a numpy.ndarray and NaTType.

The potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function is in the definition of the `column_op` functions. These `column_op` functions are used to perform the actual operation on DataFrame columns and are defined based on different types of the `right` parameter. It appears that the implementation of these `column_op` functions may be causing the unsupported operand type error.

The bug occurs because the implementation of the `column_op` functions in the `dispatch_to_series` method does not handle the NaT (Not a Time) type appropriately when performing arithmetic operations with numpy arrays.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` functions need to be modified to handle the NaT type appropriately when performing arithmetic operations on DataFrame columns.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` method with the fixed `column_op` functions:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isnull(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isnull(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)
    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the updated `column_op` functions, the `pd.isnull` method is used to check for the presence of NaT values, and the arithmetic operation is only performed if the value is not NaT. If the value is NaT, it is returned as is without the arithmetic operation. This modification ensures that the NaT values are handled appropriately during arithmetic operations, preventing the unsupported operand type error.
