1. The test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` involves performing arithmetic operations between a DataFrame and a Series containing `NaT`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the multiplication operation (*). 

2. The error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the `column_op` function, which is used to operate on the columns of a DataFrame. The error message specifically points to the line where the `op` function is being applied to elements of the DataFrame and the Series.

3. The bug occurred because the `NaT` (Not a Time) type in pandas is not handled properly while performing arithmetic operations, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to multiply `NaT` with the DataFrame elements.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `NaT` type is encountered while performing arithmetic operations. This can be done by adding a condition to check for `NaT` type and handle it appropriately within the `column_op` function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `dispatch_to_series`:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right):
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    def column_op_na(a, b):
        if b is pd.NaT:
            return pd.NaT
        return func(a, b)

    def eval_column_op(a, b):
        return {i: column_op_na(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(eval_column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, a new function `column_op_na` is defined to handle the special case where the second operand of the arithmetic operation is `NaT`. This function checks if `b` is `pd.NaT` and returns `pd.NaT` if true, otherwise, it performs the operation as usual. Additionally, a new function `eval_column_op` is created to handle the evaluation of the new column operation function.
