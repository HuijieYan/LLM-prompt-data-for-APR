The issue is that the function `dispatch_to_series` is not handling the case where the right operand is a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]`. The function attempts to perform the operation based on different conditions (`lib.is_scalar(right)` or `isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame)`), but it seems that the condition for handling a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]` is missing.

To fix the bug, we need to check for this specific case and handle it appropriately. We can modify the `dispatch_to_series` function to operate row-by-row when the right operand is a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]` and the `axis` is "columns".

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]' and axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly check for the case where `right` is a Series with dtype `timedelta64[ns]` and `axis` is "columns", and then handle it appropriately. This should resolve the issue and allow the test case to run without errors.
