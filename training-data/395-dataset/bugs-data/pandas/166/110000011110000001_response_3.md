The error indicates that an unexpected warning is being produced, specifically a 'FutureWarning' related to sorting because non-concatenation axis is not aligned.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'join_compat' method which appears to be triggering a warning about future behavior related to sorting.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the 'sort' parameter being passed to the 'join' operation which may not be aligned with the expected behavior as indicated by the warning message.

To fix this bug, we can modify the 'join_compat' method to handle the 'sort' parameter according to the warning message. Specifically, we can use a conditional to check if the 'sort' parameter is set to True, and if so, pass 'sort=True' to the 'join' operation; this should help suppress the warning message.

Here's the corrected code for the 'join_compat' method after addressing the bug:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
            )

        return joined
```
In this corrected code, we modified the 'merge' operation inside the 'for' loop to include the 'sort' parameter when merging the frames. This should help suppress the warning message regarding sorting behavior.
