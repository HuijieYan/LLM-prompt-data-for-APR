The issue seems to be related to the `sort` parameter in the `join` operation. The error message suggests that passing `sort=False` should hide the warning, but it's not working as expected.

The issue might be in the implementation of the `_join_compat` method, especially in the `else` block where `can_concat` is True. It seems that the condition to check the `sort` parameter is not correctly handled in this block.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `can_concat` is True and `sort` is False, the warning is not shown. This can be achieved by making necessary adjustments in the conditional logic inside the `else` block in the `_join_compat` method.

Here's the corrected method based on the provided input parameter values, expected variable values, and the bug description:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            elif sort:  # Add this condition to check the sort parameter
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

In this corrected method, we added a condition to check if `sort` is True when `can_concat` is True, and if so, it will concatenate the frames without showing the warning.
