The bug occurs because the `FutureWarning` is raised even when `sort=False` is passed as an argument to the `join` method. This behavior is unexpected, and the erroneous code needs to be fixed.

The potential error location is within the `_join_compat` method of the DataFrame class, which is used by the `join` function.

The reason for the bug is that the `can_concat` variable is not being used to handle the case where the sort parameter is passed as `False`. This causes the warning to be raised even when `sort=False`.

To fix the bug, we need to utilize the `can_concat` variable to handle the case when `sort=False` is passed as an argument. By checking the value of `sort` and using the `can_concat` variable in the `if-else` condition, we can resolve the issue and suppress the warning when `sort=False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index."
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat and sort:
            res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
            return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
        else:
            return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)
```

In the corrected code, the `can_concat` variable is used in combination with the `sort` parameter to handle the case when `sort=False` is passed as an argument.

With this correction, the warning should be suppressed when `sort=False` is passed to the `join` method.
