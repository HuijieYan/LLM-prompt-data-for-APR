The problem seems to be related to the handling of the `sort` parameter in the `join` function. The `sort` parameter expects a boolean value, but the error message indicates that a `FutureWarning` is being raised due to this parameter. This indicates that the `sort` parameter is not being handled correctly in the original `join` method.

One potential issue might be that the `sort` parameter is not being passed to the underlying join operation correctly. It seems that the warning is being triggered within the `pandas/core/frame.py` file at line 7216. This suggests that the issue lies in the `join` method in the `pandas` library, and not in the test function.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the `sort` parameter is being correctly passed down to the underlying join operation. Additionally, if the `sort` value is set to `None`, it might need to be handled in a manner consistent with the expected behavior of the `join` method.

Here's a corrected version of the `join` method with the fix:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,  # pass the 'sort' parameter to the merge operation
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
            )

        return joined
```

In this corrected version, the `sort` parameter is passed down to the underlying operations, both in the `merge` and `concat` functions, so it should be handled correctly in all cases.
