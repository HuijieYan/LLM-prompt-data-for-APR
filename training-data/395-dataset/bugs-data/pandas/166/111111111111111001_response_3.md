The bug seems to be caused by the `_join_compat` function, specifically when the `sort` parameter is passed as an argument to the `join` method. It is related to the warning message about future behavior changes due to sorting.

The bug occurs because the `_join_compat` function does not handle the `sort` parameter correctly. It seems that the `sort` parameter is being passed directly to the `merge` or `concat` functions without considering the future behavior changes in pandas. This is resulting in the unexpected warning message and the failure of the test.

To fix this bug, the `_join_compat` function needs to be updated to handle the `sort` parameter appropriately. Specifically, when calling `merge` or `concat` functions, a condition should be added to ensure that the `sort` parameter is handled according to the future behavior changes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        if sort and pd.__future__.sort_behaviour_changed:
            warn("FutureWarning: Sorting behavior has changed. Pass 'sort=False' to retain the current behavior and silence the warning.", FutureWarning)
            sort = False  # Update sort parameter according to future behavior
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if sort and pd.__future__.sort_behaviour_changed:
                warn("FutureWarning: Sorting behavior has changed. Pass 'sort=False' to retain the current behavior and silence the warning.", FutureWarning)
                sort = False  # Update sort parameter according to future behavior

            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
            )

        return joined
```

In the corrected code, there are checks for the `sort` parameter and the future behavior changes in pandas. If the `sort` parameter is set to `True` and the behavior has changed in pandas, a warning is issued, and the `sort` parameter is updated to `False` to retain the current behavior and silence the warning.

This should fix the bug and prevent the unexpected warning message from occurring in the test.
