The error occurs when the `join` function is called with the `sort` parameter set to `True`. The error message indicates that a `FutureWarning` is being raised due to sorting when the non-concatenation axis is not aligned.

The potential error location is within the `_join_compat` function, specifically where the `join` operation is performed using either `merge` or `concat`. The issue likely arises from the handling of the `sort` parameter during the join operation.

The bug occurs because the `sort` parameter is not being handled correctly during the join operation. The error message suggests that the behavior of sorting will change in a future version of pandas. The warning recommends passing `sort=False` to accept the future behavior and silence the warning, or `sort=True` to retain the current behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_join_compat` function should appropriately handle the `sort` parameter when performing the join operation. Based on the error message, the `sort` parameter should be used to control the sorting behavior during the join operation.

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,  # Pass the sort parameter to the merge function
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)  # Pass the sort parameter to the concat function
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)  # Pass the sort parameter to the concat function

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort  # Pass the sort parameter to the merge function
            )

        return joined
```

With these corrections, the `sort` parameter is appropriately handled when performing the join operation. This should resolve the warning message and ensure the correct behavior of the `join` operation based on the provided `sort` parameter.
