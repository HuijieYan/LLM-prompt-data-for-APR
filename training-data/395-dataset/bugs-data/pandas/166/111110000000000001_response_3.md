The potential error location within the problematic function is the way it checks the type of the `other` parameter and how it handles DataFrames and Series differently.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when `other` is a list of DataFrames. It also raises a ValueError when checking if `other` is a Series, but without a name, which should not be the case.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be able to handle the case when `other` is a list of DataFrames and use the `concat` function to join the DataFrames instead of `merge`.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_compat(
        self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
    ):
        from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
        from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat
        
        if isinstance(other, Series):
            if other.name is None:
                other.name = "other"
            other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

        if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
            if on is not None:
                merge_on = on
            else:
                merge_on = None
                
            return merge(
                self,
                other,
                left_on=merge_on,
                how=how,
                left_index=on is None,
                right_index=merge_on is None,
                suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
                sort=sort,
            )
        else:
            if on is not None:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
                )

            if isinstance(other, list):
                frames = [self] + other  # include all DataFrames in the list
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `other` is a Series and give it a name if it doesn't have one. We then handle the case when `other` is a DataFrame and the case when it is a list of DataFrames, using the `concat` function to join the DataFrames in the list.
