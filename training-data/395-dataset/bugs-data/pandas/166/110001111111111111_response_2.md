The bug appears to be in the `_join_compat` function, particularly in the code that handles the `sort` parameter when joining the DataFrames. The error message from the test function indicates that the warning is not being suppressed when the `sort` parameter is set to `False`.

The reason for the bug is that the logic for suppressing the warning based on the `sort` parameter is not correctly implemented. The logic appears to check for the value of `sort_kw` but is failing to suppress the warning as expected.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `sort` parameter and suppressing the warning needs to be revised in the `_join_compat` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

In this corrected function, `sort=sort` is added as an argument to the `concat` and `merge` functions to ensure that the `sort` parameter is respected when performing the join operations.

With this correction, the warning related to sorting should be suppressed when the `sort` parameter is appropriately set, as indicated in the test case.
