The potential error in the given function is in the initial 'if' condition where it checks if 'other' is an instance of a Series. The bug occurs due to the incorrect indentation of the subsequent code block, which should be aligned to run if the condition is met.

The bug occurs because the code block intended to execute when 'other' is an instance of a Series is not properly indented, causing it to be outside the 'if' block. This results in a logical error as the code within the block should only execute when the condition is met.

To fix the bug, the code block for handling the case where 'other' is an instance of a Series should be correctly indented to be inside the 'if' block. This will ensure that the correct behavior is applied based on the type of 'other'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

        if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
            return merge(
                self,
                other,
                left_on=on,
                how=how,
                left_index=on is None,
                right_index=True,
                suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
                sort=sort,
            )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
