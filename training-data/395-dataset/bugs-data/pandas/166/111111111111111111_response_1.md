The issue seems to be with the `join` function. Despite passing `sort=True` or `sort=False` as an argument to the `join` function, a warning related to sorting still appears.

The `join` method in the DataFrame class takes a `sort` parameter to determine whether to sort the resulting DataFrame by the join keys. When `sort` is set to `False`, the warning about non-concatenation axis sorting should be suppressed.

The problem may lie within the `_join_compat` method of the `DataFrame` class, which is responsible for joining multiple DataFrames.

The error occurs because the `_join_compat` method does not correctly handle the `sort` parameter, which results in the warning not being suppressed.

To fix this issue, the `_join_compat` method should be updated to correctly handle the `sort` parameter and pass it to the `join` method.

Here's the corrected `_join_compat` method:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(
                    frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort
                )

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort)

        return joined
```

By adding the `sort` parameter to the concatenation and merge operations within the `_join_compat` method, the warning should be correctly suppressed when `sort` is set to `False`. This should resolve the issue that was observed in the test function.
