Potential error location:
The issue is likely to be in the section of the code where the 'can_concat' variable is being used to determine how to proceed. This variable is being set based on the uniqueness of the index in the list of frames.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the 'can_concat' variable is being used to determine the concatenation behavior by checking if all the DataFrame indexes within the 'frames' list are unique. This check is being performed without taking into account the 'sort' parameter. As a result, the warning is not being suppressed when 'sort=False' is passed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fixing the bug would be to incorporate the 'sort' parameter into the logic for determining the concatenation behavior. This would involve adjusting the code that sets the 'can_concat' variable to consider the 'sort' parameter. If 'sort=False', the concatenation behavior should be modified accordingly to suppress the warning.

Corrected code:
```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,  # Pass the 'sort' parameter to the merge function
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        # Adjust the logic to set can_concat based on sort parameter
        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames) and sort

        if can_concat:  # Use sort parameter to determine the concatenation behavior
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

By incorporating the 'sort' parameter into the logic for determining concatenation behavior and passing it to the merge function, the warning should be suppressed as expected.
