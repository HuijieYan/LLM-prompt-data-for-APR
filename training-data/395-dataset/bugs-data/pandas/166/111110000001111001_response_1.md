The buggy function returns the wrong value when sorting is set to True. In this case, it attempts to apply the outer join to the frames when it should be applying the left join instead.

To fix the bug, we need to change the return statement in the if statement that checks if can_concat is True. When sorting is set to True, the outer join should be used, but when sorting is set to False, the left join should be applied.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def _join_compat(
        self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
    ):
        from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
        from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat
    
        if isinstance(other, Series):
            if other.name is None:
                raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
            other = DataFrame({other.name: other})
    
        if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
            return merge(
                self,
                other,
                left_on=on,
                how=how,
                left_index=on is None,
                right_index=True,
                suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
                sort=sort,
            )
        else:
            if on is not None:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
                )
    
            frames = [self] + list(other)
    
            can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)
    
            # join indexes only using concat
            if can_concat:
                if sort:  # Change made here
                    return concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                else:
                    return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)
    
            joined = frames[0]
    
            for frame in frames[1:]:
                joined = merge(
                    joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
                )
    
            return joined
```
This change ensures that the correct join type is used based on the sort parameter, and the function should now work as expected.
