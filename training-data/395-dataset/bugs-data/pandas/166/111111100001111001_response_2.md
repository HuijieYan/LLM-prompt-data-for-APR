Potential error location: The error is likely in the if statement checking if `can_concat` is True. If `can_concat` is True, the function should return a concatenated dataframe. However, in the initial code, it's written to return the result of a reindex operation if `how` is 'left', which doesn't make sense.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code does not handle the case where `how` is 'left' and `can_concat` is True. It should return the concatenated dataframe when `can_concat` is True, regardless of the value of `how`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: In the code, the return statement for the case where `can_concat` is True should be modified to return the concatenated dataframe directly, without performing a reindex operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            return concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```
