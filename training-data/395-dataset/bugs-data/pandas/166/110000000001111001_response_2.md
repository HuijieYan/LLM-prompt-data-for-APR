The bug seems to be occurring because the 'other' parameter is a list of DataFrames instead of a single DataFrame. The function checks if 'other' is an instance of Series or DataFrame, and if it's a DataFrame, it performs a merge. However, in this case, 'other' is a list of DataFrames, so it tries to concatenate them instead of merging.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the case where 'other' is a list of DataFrames by concatenating them instead of attempting to merge. This can be done by iterating through the list of DataFrames and performing the concatenation.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _join_compat(self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, pd.Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = pd.DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, list):
        frames = [self] + other

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)
    
    if isinstance(other, pd.DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
```
