The problematic function is `_join_compat` within the `DataFrame` class. The error in this function occurs when trying to join multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to only allow joining on the index if multiple DataFrames are being joined. If joining on the index is not specified and multiple DataFrames are provided, the function should raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        if on is None:
            return merge(
                self,
                other,
                how=how,
                left_index=True,
                right_index=True,
                suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
                sort=sort,
            )
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported type for 'other'")
```
