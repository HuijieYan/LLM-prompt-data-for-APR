Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the `_join_compat` function, specifically in the `join` method call when the `sort` parameter is set to True.

Reasons behind the Bug: The bug occurs because the `join` method of the Pandas DataFrame does not directly support the `sort` parameter. This parameter is used to suppress a future warning caused by the mismatch of index alignment during the join operation.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `sort` parameter is set to True and handle the warning suppression accordingly.
2. Use an alternative approach to perform the join operation without triggering the warning.
3. Modify how the join is performed to avoid the sorting behavior that triggers the warning.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _join_compat(self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return self.join(other, on=on, how=how, lsuffix=lsuffix, rsuffix=rsuffix, sortable_name=sort)
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError("Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index")

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = joined.join(frame, how=how, lsuffix=lsuffix, rsuffix=rsuffix)

        return joined
```
