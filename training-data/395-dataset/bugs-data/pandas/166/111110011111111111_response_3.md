The error occurs due to the unresolved warning regarding sorting while concatenating data frames in the `join` function, as observed from the error message during the test execution. The warning is not suppressed even when the `sort` parameter is explicitly set to `False`.

The potential error location lies within the `_join_compat` function, as this is where the concatenation operation takes place, and the warning is being generated.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic for suppressing the warning based on the `sort` parameter is not correctly implemented. The warning should be suppressed when `sort=False` is explicitly passed as an argument.

To fix the bug, the logic in the `_join_compat` function should be modified to correctly handle the suppression of the warning based on the `sort` parameter.

Below is the corrected code for the `_join_compat` function:

```python
def _join_compat(self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    # Existing code remains unchanged

    # join indexes only using concat
    if can_concat:
        if sort:
            res = concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)
        else:
            res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
        return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)

    # Existing code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the `sort` parameter is directly used to conditionally determine the behavior of the concatenation operation and to suppress the warning. If `sort=True`, the concatenation operation sorts the data, and the warning is not suppressed. If `sort=False` or left as default, the concatenation operation is non-sorting, and the warning is suppressed.

This corrected implementation of the `_join_compat` function should resolve the bug and suppress the warning when `sort=False` is explicitly passed as an argument.
