Potential error location: `_join_compat` function in the `DataFrame` class seems to be the problematic function because it's responsible for joining DataFrames and handling the `sort` argument.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to occur because the `sort` argument is not being properly handled in the `_join_compat` function. Even when the `sort` argument is set to False, it's still showing the warning message related to sorting.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check whether the `sort` argument is being passed correctly to the downstream functions, such as `concat` and `merge`.
- Ensure that the `sort` argument is being respected and passed along to the downstream functions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,  # Pass the 'sort' argument down to the merge function
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)  # Pass the 'sort' argument to concat
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True, sort=sort)  # Pass the 'sort' argument to concat

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort  # Pass the 'sort' argument to merge
            )

        return joined
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `sort` argument is properly passed down to the `merge` and `concat` functions, thus addressing the issue with the warning message not being silenced.
