The bug in the function `_join_compat` occurs due to the incorrect function call. The function tries to call `merge` and `concat` from the wrong modules. Additionally, there's a check for the `other` parameter being a Series, which prevents the code from executing when `other` is a list.

To fix the bug, we need to call the correct merge and concat functions from the pandas library. We also need to remove the unnecessary check for `other` being a Series.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas import merge, concat, DataFrame
    
    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + other

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```

This corrected code uses the correct functions, and it removes the unnecessary check for `other` being a Series.
