The function `_join_compat` is intended to join DataFrames and/or Series. It first checks whether the input `other` is a Series or DataFrame, and then attempts to merge the input with the original DataFrame. If the input `other` is not a DataFrame, it checks for a condition where it can perform a concatenation instead of a merge.

In all three cases, the code branches into a section that checks for the `can_concat` condition, which determines if the `frames` can be concatenated. The condition `if can_concat` is always evaluating to `True` due to an incorrect check for the unique index.

The bug occurs because the `can_concat` check is always returning `True`, leading to the code executing the concatenated dataframes branch when it should perhaps perform a merge. This indicates that there is an issue with the evaluation of `can_concat`, and this may stem from the way the variable `frames` is constructed or how the `can_concat` condition is checked.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to correctly determine whether the concatenation can be performed. This could involve reviewing the way `frames` are constructed and how the `can_concat` condition is evaluated. 

The corrected code for the `buggy` function is as follows:

```python
def _join_compat(
        self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
    ):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)
        
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True
            )

        return joined
```
