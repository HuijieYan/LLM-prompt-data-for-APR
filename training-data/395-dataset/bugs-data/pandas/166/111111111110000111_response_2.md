The test case "test_suppress_future_warning_with_sort_kw" is designed to check if the warning is correctly suppressed when the "sort" argument is set to True, False, or None. The error message indicates that when "sort_kw" is set to True or False, the warning is not being suppressed as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the "sort" argument in the "_join_compat" method of the "DataFrame" class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "sort" argument is not being properly handled within the "_join_compat" method, leading to the warning not being correctly suppressed.

To fix the bug, the conditional handling of the "sort" argument should be revised so that the warning is correctly suppressed based on the value of the "sort" argument.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _join_compat(
    self, other, on=None, how="left", lsuffix="", rsuffix="", sort=False
):
    from pandas.core.reshape.merge import merge
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, Series):
        if other.name is None:
            raise ValueError("Other Series must have a name")
        other = DataFrame({other.name: other})

    if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
        return merge(
            self,
            other,
            left_on=on,
            how=how,
            left_index=on is None,
            right_index=True,
            suffixes=(lsuffix, rsuffix),
            sort=sort,
        )
    else:
        if on is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Joining multiple DataFrames only supported for joining on index"
            )

        frames = [self] + list(other)

        can_concat = all(df.index.is_unique for df in frames)

        # join indexes only using concat
        if can_concat:
            if how == "left":
                res = concat(frames, axis=1, join="outer", verify_integrity=True)
                return res.reindex(self.index, copy=False)
            else:
                return concat(frames, axis=1, join=how, verify_integrity=True)

        joined = frames[0]

        for frame in frames[1:]:
            joined = merge(
                joined, frame, how=how, left_index=True, right_index=True, sort=sort
            )

        return joined
```

In the corrected code, the "sort" argument is passed to the merge function when joining multiple DataFrames, ensuring that the warning is either suppressed or not based on the value of the "sort" argument.
