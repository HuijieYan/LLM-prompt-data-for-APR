Potential error location: The code seems to be attempting to unstack a DataFrame based on multiple columns, but there are issues in handling hierarchical columns.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The code does not handle hierarchical columns correctly, leading to errors in unstacking the DataFrame.
2. The logic for unstacking the DataFrame based on multiple columns is not implemented correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for hierarchical columns and handle them appropriately in the unstacking process.
2. Implement the logic for unstacking the DataFrame based on multiple columns in a structured manner, considering edge cases and potential errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Create a MultiIndex object for clocs
    clocs_names = [index.names[i] if index.names[i] in clocs else None for i in range(index.nlevels)]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Perform unstacking based on clocs
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    # Handle the creation of new columns for the unstacked DataFrame
    levels = [clevels] + [rlevels]
    codes = [unstacked.index.codes[0]] + rcodes
    names = [cnames] + rnames

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=levels, 
        codes=codes, 
        names=names, 
        verify_integrity=False
    )

    unstacked.index = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
