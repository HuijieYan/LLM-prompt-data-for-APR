The issue in the provided function `_unstack_multiple` lies in the line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`. It appears that the intention is to use the variable `val` instead of `i` to compare with `v`. 

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is a logical error in the conditional expression within the list comprehension. The variable `i` seems to be incorrectly used as the counter variable, instead of comparing with the individual values of `clocs`. 

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to replace `i` with `val` in the conditional expression within the list comprehension.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet
    
    index = data.index
    
    # GH 19966 Make sure if MultiIndexed index has tuple name, they will be
    # recognised as a whole
    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)
    
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

The code modification involves replacing `i` with `val` in the list comprehension (`clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`). This change addresses the logical error in the previous version and should resolve the bug related to the unstack operation.
