The bug seems to be occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error is due to the `index` and `clocs` variables not being processed correctly within the function.

Reasons for the bug:
- The function is trying to access the index names with the `clocs` variable directly, which is causing an error.
- Additionally, inappropriate transformations and operations are being performed on the `clocs` variable and the index.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if `clocs` is in the index names before further processing.
- Use appropriate methods to perform the required transformations on the index and `clocs` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check if clocs is in the index names
    if set(clocs).issubset(index.names):
        clocs = [clocs]
    else:
        # Handle the case where clocs is not in index names
        # Assuming this is a MultiIndex
        if isinstance(index, pd.MultiIndex):
            for i, name in enumerate(index.names):
                if name in clocs:
                    clocs[i] = name
                    break

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This corrected code should handle the issues related to `clocs` and the index within the `_unstack_multiple` function and help resolve the observed errors.
