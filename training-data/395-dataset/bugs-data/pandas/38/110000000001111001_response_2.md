The problem lies in the logic of the function `_unstack_multiple`. The code snippet `clocs in index.names` does not serve the intended purpose of checking if the `clocs` list is contained in the `index.names` list. Instead, it checks if all elements of `clocs` are present as a single element in `index.names`.

Potential reason for the bug:
The code doesn't correctly handle the case when multiple elements from the `clocs` list are present in the `index.names` list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different approach to check if all elements from the `clocs` list are contained in the `index.names` list.
2. Use a loop to iterate over the elements of `clocs` and check if each element is present in `index.names`.

Error location: The code `clocs in index.names` is likely causing the bug as it doesn't perform the correct check.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Check if all elements from clocs are present in index.names
    if all(col in data.columns.names for col in clocs):
        index = data.index
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
        # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
