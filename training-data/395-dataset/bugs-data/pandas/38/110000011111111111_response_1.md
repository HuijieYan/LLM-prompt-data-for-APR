The problem seems to be occurring in the `_unstack_multiple` function, possibly due to mistyped variable names causing issues in unstacking with MultiIndex dataframes.

The failure occurs when analyzing the input for DataFrame unstacking. The problem may be due to using the wrong variable when iterating in a list comprehension.

The `clocs` list needs to be used in the list comprehension instead of `i` to avoid the IndexError due to the wrong variable being used for comparison.

Here's the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (rest of the original code)

    # Corrected list comprehension for `clocs`
    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # ... (rest of the original code)

    return unstacked
```

By making this change, the function should handle unstacking MultiIndex dataframes correctly without raising the IndexError due to comparing incorrect variables in the list comprehension. Now, the unstacking process should be performed as intended.
