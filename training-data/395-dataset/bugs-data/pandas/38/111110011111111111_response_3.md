The potential error in the `_unstack_multiple` function is related to the use of the variable `i` instead of `val` at the line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`. This is likely causing the issue with unstacking and leading to the IndexError.

The bug occurs because the variable `i` is being used inappropriately to compare with `v` and modify the value of `v`. This is not suitable for its intended purpose, which is to represent an item in the list of `clocs`. As a result, incorrect values are being generated, leading to the bug.

To fix this bug, the variable `i` should be replaced with the intended variable `val` at the line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`. This will ensure that the correct variable is used for comparison and value modification.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Fix the incorrect variable usage
    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return unstacked
```

By making this change, the bug related to unstacking in the `_unstack_multiple` function will be resolved, and the function should work as intended without raising the IndexError.
