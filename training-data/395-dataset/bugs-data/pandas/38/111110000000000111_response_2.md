Potential error locations:
- Parsing `clocs` as an integer instead of a list, which will lead to the comparison with an index object later in the code.

Reasons behind the bug:
- The function is incorrectly parsing `clocs` as an integer which is expected to be a list, causing issues when trying to compare it with `index.names`.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug:
- Change the code to handle `clocs` as a list to ensure that comparisons with `index.names` work properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```
