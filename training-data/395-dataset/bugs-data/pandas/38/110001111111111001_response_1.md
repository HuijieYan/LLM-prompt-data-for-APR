The bug is likely located in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class, which is being called inside the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error is raised when the program attempts to find the level number of the input but encounters an issue due to multiple occurrences of the input name and possibly the number of levels in the index.

The bug occurs because the index and column names are being manipulated incorrectly, leading to errors when attempting to access elements using the incorrect level numbers. This causes the different test cases to fail when comparing indices and columns.

To fix the bug, the code needs to correctly handle the levels, codes, and names of the index and columns to ensure that unstacking is performed accurately.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Update the implementation of this method to correctly handle MultiIndex
    idx = data.index
    if clocs in idx.names:
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [idx._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    cidx = [idx.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    clev = [idx.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [idx.names[i] for i in clocs]

    ridx = [i for i in range(idx.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    result = data.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)
    new_columns = result.columns.to_flat_index()
    new_columns = MultiIndex.from_arrays(new_columns, names=cnames)

    rlev = [idx.levels[i] for i in ridx]
    rcod = [idx.codes[i] for i in ridx]
    rnames = [idx.names[i] for i in ridx]

    if ridx == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlev + [obs_ids], codes=rcod + [comp_ids], names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"], verify_integrity=False
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clev
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = cidx
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            return result  # Unstacking already performed for columns

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clev
        new_names = [result.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(cidx, sort=False)
            recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, idx.codes, xnull=False)
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected method should resolve the bug and produce the expected results for the provided test cases.
