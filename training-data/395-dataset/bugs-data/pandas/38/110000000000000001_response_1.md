Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the nested if statements, particularly in the section where the function checks if the input data is a Series or not.

Reason Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle all possible cases when the input data is a Series or a DataFrame with a MultiIndex.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of input data and handle each case separately, providing the appropriate processing for both Series and DataFrames.
2. Ensure that all necessary steps are taken to properly unstack the input data, considering the possibility of hierarchical columns and multi-level indexes.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        dummy = data.copy()

        # Process for unstacking a Series
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)

        # Set new index for unstacked Series
        new_columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(unstacked.index, names=clocs)
        unstacked = unstacked.reindex(columns=new_columns)

    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        # Process for unstacking a DataFrame with MultiIndex
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
