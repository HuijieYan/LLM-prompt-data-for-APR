Potential error location: 
The code may be incorrect in the following line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`. It seems like `i` is incorrectly used instead of `val`.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug likely occurs because the variable `i` is being used instead of `val` in the list comprehension, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the indexing and unstacking process.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Replace `i` with `val` in the list comprehension to correctly adjust the values in the `clocs` list.

Corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # The following line has been corrected
    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    return unstacked
```
