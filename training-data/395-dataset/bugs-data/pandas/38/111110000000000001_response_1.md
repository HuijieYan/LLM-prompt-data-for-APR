Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the provided function is when the input data is a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. The function attempts to unstack the columns but does not handle the case properly.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not account for the case when the input data has MultiIndex columns. This results in an error during the unstacking process.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the input data has MultiIndex columns, and if so, handle the unstacking process accordingly.
2. Modify the unstacking process to handle MultiIndex columns properly by considering the levels and codes of the MultiIndex.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # If the input data has MultiIndex columns, handle the unstacking process
    if isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for val in clocs:
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
        return result

    # Rest of the code for handling single index columns
    ...
```
