The issue occurs when trying to unstack a DataFrame with multiple levels in the index and columns. The test cases indicate that the unstack operation is not producing the expected output due to an error in the `_unstack_multiple()` function, specifically the line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`. The 'i' variable should be replaced with 'val' to properly iterate over the elements of the list of column locations (clocs).

The reason for this bug is that the variable 'i' is not initialized or updated within the context of the loop. This results in all elements of the list 'clocs' being modified as per the first element i.e., incorrect indices are being used for modification.

To fix the issue, it is recommended to use a different variable within the loop to iterate over the elements of 'clocs'.

Here is the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other parts of the function)

    # Replace i with val to properly iterate over the elements of clocs
    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
  
    # ... (rest of the function)
```

By making this change, the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function should be fixed, and the unstack operation on DataFrames with multiple levels of indices and columns should produce the expected output.

This fix should resolve the unstacking issues reported in the bug reports and enable the function to handle multi-level unstacking with correct behavior.
