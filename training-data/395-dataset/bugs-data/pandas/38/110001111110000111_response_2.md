The error in the `unstack` method may be due to a mistake in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The unstacking of multiple levels columns or indices could be leading to the error as described in the issue and the associated test cases.

The issue seems to be occurring when unstacking a DataFrame with multiple levels in the columns or indices. The root cause of the issue seems to be an incorrect calculation of the `clocs` list.

A potential approach to fixing this bug can be correcting the calculation of the `clocs` list to ensure that the logic is correctly identifying the specified levels to be unstacked. Additionally, handling multi-level columns and indices correctly should resolve the issues described in the test cases and the associated issue descriptions.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # GH 19966 Make sure if MultiIndexed index has tuple name, they will be
    # recognised as a whole
    if any(cl in index.names for cl in clocs):
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(cl) for cl in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged, as the root cause of the issue was the incorrect calculation of clocs
```

This corrected code addresses the problem by ensuring that the correct levels are being extracted based on the indices, and then the data is unstacked accordingly.
