Potential Error:
The `_unstack_multiple` function contains an error as it is not handling the input correctly. The provided input and the expected output do not match.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The _unstack_multiple function is not correctly understanding the input and hence not providing the desired output. This could be due to a misinterpretation of the input parameters or a logical error within the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the input parameters to ensure they are correctly interpreted within the function.
2. Identify the incorrect logic or handling of input parameters and modify it to align with the expected behavior.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the function _unstack_multiple by correctly handling the input clocs and data parameters. This includes proper interpretation of the positions of index elements and levels as per the expected output.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert clocs to integers based on the column names
    cloc_indices = [data.columns.get_loc(cloc) for cloc in clocs]

    # Make sure the index is reset
    data = data.reset_index()

    # Unstack using the cloc indices
    unstacked = data.unstack(cloc_indices, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the input clocs are converted to corresponding integer indices based on the column names using `data.columns.get_loc(cloc)`. The data is then reset and unstacked using the derived column indices. This approach ensures that the unstacking is performed correctly based on the input parameters.
