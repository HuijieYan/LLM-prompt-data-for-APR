## Issue Analysis
The `_unstack_multiple` function seems to have several issues:
1. It explicitly checks for a condition where `rlocs` is an empty list, however this check is unnecessary given the subsequent codes would still be executed correctly.
2. The variable `val` is being reassigned to a different value in the for loop, without making use of its original value.
3. The function includes a conditional check for checking whether the input is a Series, however, the check for a DataFrame is not included within the conditional block.

## Suggestions
1. Remove the conditional check for an empty `rlocs` list, and proceed with the subsequent codes.
2. Remove the reassignment of `val` within the loop, as it is not being used.
3. Add a check for a DataFrame within the conditional block that is already checking for a Series.

## Revised Code
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # GH 19966 Make sure if MultiIndexed index has tuple name, they will be
    # recognized as a whole
    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]

        assert isinstance(unstcols, MultiIndex)  # for mypy
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

    return unstacked
