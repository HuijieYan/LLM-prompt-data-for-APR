In the provided buggy function `_unstack_multiple`, the bugs might be due to the incorrect assignment of values to the `clocs` list and the incorrect naming of variables.

To fix the bugs, the following changes can be made:

1. The variable `i` is incorrectly used in the code. It should be replaced with `val` to correctly reflect the intended logic.

2. The statement `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]` should be modified to `clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]` to ensure that the correct logic is applied while manipulating the list `clocs`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (other code remains the same)

    for val in clocs:
        if val in index.names:
            clocs = [val]

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # The rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With these changes, the issues related to incorrect assignment and possible name clashes within the function should be resolved. Remember to thoroughly test the modified function with the test cases provided to ensure that the bug has been successfully fixed.
