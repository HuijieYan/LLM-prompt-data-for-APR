The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The code raises a ValueError with the message "2 is not in list". This happens because the index does not contain a level with the number 2, causing the `_get_level_number` method to raise an error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the level number used is not present in the index. This causes the function to raise an error and fail to unstack the dataframe properly.

To fix the bug, the code within `_unstack_multiple` needs to be changed to ensure that the level number used is present in the index before calling `_get_level_number`. Additionally, the error messages when handling level numbers should be properly handled to provide accurate information about the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    level_numbers = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs if i in index.names]

    if not level_numbers:
        raise ValueError("One or more specified levels not found in the index.")

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]
    
    # rest of the function remains the same as the original
    # ...
```

In this corrected function, the level numbers are checked using `if i in index.names` before calling `_get_level_number`. If the level is not found in the index, the function raises a ValueError. This approach ensures that only valid level numbers are used and handled properly, addressing the bug in the original code.
