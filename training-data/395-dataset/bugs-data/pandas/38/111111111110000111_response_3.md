The error message indicates that the function `_unstack_multiple` is encountering an "IndexError" with the message "Too many levels: Index has only 2 levels, not 3". This suggests that the error might be related to indexing and unstacking multiple levels in the DataFrame.

Upon analysis, it seems that the issue with the existing code is in the calculation of `clocs`. The line `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]` has `i` as a variable which does not seem to be correctly related to the loop. That's why it's likely causing the calculation of `clocs` to produce incorrect results, leading to the "IndexError".

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified in the calculation of `clocs` to refer to the proper variable. It appears that `i` should be replaced with another variable `val` so that the correct comparison is made during the iteration.

Here's the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # ... (omitted code) ...
```

By making this change, the comparison during the iteration of `clocs` should be done correctly, avoiding the "Too many levels" error that was reported.

After making this correction, the function should work properly when unstacking multiple levels in the DataFrame.
