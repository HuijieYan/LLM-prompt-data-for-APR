The issue seems to lie within the `_get_level_number` method in the MultiIndex class, which is part of the Pandas library, based on the error messages provided.

The error message "IndexError: Too many levels: Index has only 2 levels, not 3" implies that there is an issue with the number of levels in the MultiIndex when the unstack operation is performed. This indicates that the function for unstacking within the Pandas library is encountering an unexpected behavior when dealing with multi-level indices.

This bug is likely caused by a problematic comparison within the internal method `_unstack_multiple`.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to review and revise the comparison logic within the `_unstack_multiple` method. The comparison logic should correctly handle the cases where the number of index levels is different from what is expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    if clocs in data.index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]

    clocs = [data.index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(data.index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [data.index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [data.index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [data.index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the method implementation...

    return unstacked
```

This corrected code aims to address the issue by providing a modified comparison logic within the `_unstack_multiple` function. This should handle multi-level indices and unstacking correctly, taking into account the number of levels present in the index.
