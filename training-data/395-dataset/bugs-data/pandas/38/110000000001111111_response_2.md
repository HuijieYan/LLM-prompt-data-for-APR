The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function is likely due to the logic used to update the `clocs` variable. The bug appears to be in the following line:

```python
clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
```

It seems that the intention here is to update the elements in `clocs` based on a condition, but the variable `i` is not defined within the scope of this line. This results in unexpected behavior and may lead to the reported exception.

To fix this bug, the intention should be to compare the individual elements of `clocs` with a value. Perhaps using a different variable that represents an index or a position within `clocs` could achieve the intended logic. Additionally, from the variable runtime values provided, it seems that the `clocs` list holds string values representing column names, but the bug is attempting to compare these strings with an index or position value. This may not be the correct approach to achieve the intended logic.

Unfortunately, without a complete understanding of the intended logic and the structure of the input data, it's challenging to provide a specific fix. The correction to this line depends on the desired behavior and the nature of the data being worked with.

Below is a corrected and refactored version of the `_unstack_multiple` function. It's important to note that this correction is based on an assumption about the expected behavior of the code.

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # rest of the code as originally implemented
    # ...

    # assuming the comparison is intended for string values in clocs
    new_clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # using the new_clocs for the subsequent logic
    # ...
```

In this revised version, `new_clocs` is used, assuming that the comparison is intended for string values in `clocs`. However, this fix is provided based on limited context, and the true intention of the logic will depend on the specific requirements and structure of the data and the expected behavior of the function.
