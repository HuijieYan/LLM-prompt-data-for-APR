The provided bug involves an issue with the `_unstack_multiple` function in Pandas. The function attempts to unstack a multi-index dataframe but fails to do so correctly.

The potential error location within the function is identified in the section where `clocs` is redefined:

`clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`

The main reason behind the occurrence of the bug is a mistype in the code. The variable `i` should be replaced with `val` to properly reference the loop variable.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to replace `i` with `val` in the line of code mentioned above.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for val in range(len(clocs)):  # Replace 'i' with 'val'
            v = clocs[val]  # Replace 'i' with 'val'
            result = result.unstack(v, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]  # Replace 'i' with 'val'
            
        return result

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return unstacked
```

This revised code corrects the mistype by using the variable `val` instead of `i` within the loop to ensure the correct reference to the loop variable.
