The issue with the `unstack` function arises from errors in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that the index names are being accessed as levels, causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

The error occurs when `clocs` are modified in the following line:
```python
clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
```
This modification aimed to change the level values, however, it does so incorrectly.

The reason for the bug is the mistaken use of the variable `i` instead of `val`. The incorrect usage sets up the conditions in the list comprehension incorrectly, leading to the "Too many levels" error.

To fix this bug, the code altering `clocs` should be updated to the following:
```python
clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
```

By making this change, the `unstack` function should behave as expected, resolving the errors in the test cases and the associated issue reports. The corrected ` _unstack_multiple` function is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # Fix the condition for level values in clocs
    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # ... (omitted code) ...
    return unstacked
```

With this fix, the `unstack` function should be able to handle multi-index columns as expected, and the test cases mentioned in the error messages should not raise any errors.
