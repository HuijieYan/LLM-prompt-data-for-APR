The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` can be attributed to the incorrect handling of the variable `clocs` in the section of code:

```python
clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
```

Based on the nature of the bug and the associated function, it seems that this section of code is meant to adjust the values in the `clocs` list. The intention appears to be to decrement the value of `clocs` when it is greater than `i`. However, the index variable `i` is unintentionally used as a loop counter here.

The correction would be to replace `i` with a different variable in the list comprehension. It is likely that the intended variable is `val`, which is assigned to `clocs[i]` at the beginning of the function.

Additionally, it's essential to review the function for any other potential issues, especially related to the unstacking, index creation, and handling of column types and structures.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    index = data.index

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    # ... (rest of the function)

    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        return result

    # ... (rest of the function)
```
