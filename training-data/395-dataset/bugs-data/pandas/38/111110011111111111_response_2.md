The error seems to stem from the `_unstack_multiple` function. The function is supposed to handle unstacking multi-level column data, but currently, it generates the incorrect output for certain scenarios.

The cause of the bug is likely the mistyped conditional expression `clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]`. It appears that the loop variable `i` should have been replaced with `val`. This discrepancy causes the function to produce erroneous output when unstacking multi-level columns.

To address this bug, we need to replace `i` with `val` in the conditional expression to ensure that it compares the actual level to the target level during the unstacking process.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function with the fix for the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    # GH 19966 Make sure if MultiIndexed index has tuple name, they will be
    # recognised as a whole
    if clocs in index.names:
        clocs = [clocs]
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # The bug is likely here where 'i' should be replaced with 'val'
    clocs = [v if val > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

By making this code modification, we can ensure that the unstacking function behaves as intended for multi-level columns, and the reported bugs should be resolved.
