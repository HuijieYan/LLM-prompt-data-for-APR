The error message from the first test case suggests that the `MultiIndex` is not being handled correctly in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error occurring in the test function is a result of incorrect processing and interpretation of multi-level indices.

The general root cause of the issue is that the `_unstack_multiple` function is not handling multi-level indices properly, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to unstack the DataFrame.

To fix this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be modified to correctly handle multi-level indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check if the clocs are in index.names
    for loc in clocs:
        if loc not in index.names:
            # Adjust the clocs by finding the level numbers
            clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
            break

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
```

By making these changes, the `_unstack_multiple` function should now correctly handle multi-level indices and avoid the errors encountered in the test cases.
