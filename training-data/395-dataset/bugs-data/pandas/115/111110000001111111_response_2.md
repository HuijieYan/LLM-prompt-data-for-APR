The bug occurs within the `interpolate_1d` function. When the `method` parameter is set to `'index'`, the function interpolates the NaN values using the current index values, which may not be in sorted order resulting in unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the index is not sorted when using the 'index' interpolation method. This results in unexpected behavior when interpolating values, leading to potential errors in the output.

To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that the index is sorted in ascending order when the 'index' interpolation method is used. If the index is not sorted, a warning should be raised to alert the user that errors in the output could be possible.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function with the added check:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    # existing code...

    if method == "time":
        if not getattr(xvalues, "is_all_dates", None):
            raise ValueError(
                "time-weighted interpolation only works "
                "on Series or DataFrames with a "
                "DatetimeIndex"
            )
        method = "values"

    if method == "index" and not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing:
        warn(
            "Interpolation method 'index' may produce unexpected results"
            "when the Index is not sorted with ascending=True.",
            UserWarning,
        )

    valid_limit_directions = ["forward", "backward", "both"]

    # existing code...
```

In the corrected code, a warning is raised when the 'index' interpolation method is used and the index is not sorted in ascending order. This informs the user about the potential for unexpected results and allows them to take appropriate action.
