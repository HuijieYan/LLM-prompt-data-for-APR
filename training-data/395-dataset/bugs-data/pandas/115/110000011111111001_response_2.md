The test case `test_interpolate_unsorted_index` is designed to sort the index of the series in ascending or descending order and then interpolate the missing values using the 'index' method. The expected values are manually generated for each sorting order.

The error message indicates that the actual interpolated values do not match the expected values after sorting and interpolation. This suggests a bug in the interpolation process.

The bug is occurring in the 'interpolate_1d' function, inside the block of code where the 'method' is 'index'. This is evident from the fact that the expected values are not being produced correctly when sorting is carried out in descending order.

The bug occurs because when 'preserve_nans' is constructed, the previous approach doesn't appropriately calculate the indices of 'preserve_nans' based on the 'limit_direction'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for constructing the 'preserve_nans' based on the 'limit_direction'. This will ensure that the NaN values preserved for forward and backward directions are correctly identified.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    # set preserve_nans based on direction using _interp_limit
    if limit_direction == "forward":
        preserve_nans = start_nans | set(_interp_limit(invalid, limit, 0))
    elif limit_direction == "backward":
        preserve_nans = end_nans | set(_interp_limit(invalid, 0, limit))
    else:
        # both directions... just use _interp_limit
        preserve_nans = start_nans | end_nans | set(_interp_limit(invalid, limit, limit))

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

With these updates, the 'preserve_nans' will be correctly calculated based on the 'limit_direction', ensuring that the NaN values are preserved as intended during the interpolation.
