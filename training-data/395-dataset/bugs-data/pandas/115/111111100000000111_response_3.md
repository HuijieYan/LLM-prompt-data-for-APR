The error in the provided function `interpolate_1d` is related to the `method='index'` in the interpolate method. 

When calling `s.interpolate(method='index')`, `method='index'` should return last valid observation to fill the NaN value; however, when the Index is not sorted with `ascending=True`, it returns the unexpected result.

The potential error location is within the segment of the code that handles the interpolation method 'index'.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that when the index is not sorted in ascending order, the `method='index'` interpolation does not return the expected result.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Checking if the index is sorted in ascending order and if not, raising a warning to alert the user about the potential errors in the output.
2. Sorting the index in ascending order before performing the interpolation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    if method == "index" and not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing:
        raise Warning("Index is not sorted with ascending=True. Errors in the output could be possible.")
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
