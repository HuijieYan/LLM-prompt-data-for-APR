The problem is related to calling .interpolate(method='index') on a Series or DataFrame where the Index is not sorted with ascending=True. Currently, no warning is raised in such a scenario, leading to unexpected results in the output.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the part where the method 'index' is checked and processed in the interpolate_1d function. This can be seen in the following line of code:
```Python
if method in ["linear", "time", "index", "values"]:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not check if the index is sorted with ascending=True when the method 'index' is used. This can lead to unexpected results in the output, as described in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the interpolate_1d function to include a check for whether the index is sorted with ascending=True when the method 'index' is used. If the index is not sorted in this manner, a warning should be raised to alert the user of the possible errors in the output.

The corrected code for the interpolate_1d function with the added check and warning is as follows:

```Python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import algos, lib
from pandas.core.missing import find_valid_index, isna

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Check if method is 'index' and index is not sorted with ascending=True
    if method == "index" and not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing:
        raise Warning("Index is not sorted with ascending=True, which might lead to unexpected results in the output.")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```

By adding this check and raising a warning, the user will be alerted to the possible errors in the output when using the method 'index' on an index that is not sorted with ascending=True. This should provide a clearer indication of the issue to the user.
