The potential error in the code is the way the arguments are being passed to the `interpolate_1d` function. The function is using `**kwargs` to accept additional keyword arguments, but it's also expecting specific keyword arguments like `method`, `limit`, `limit_direction`, etc.

The bug occurs because the function is not explicitly defining all the keyword arguments it expects, and instead is trying to capture them using `**kwargs`. This makes it difficult to understand what keyword arguments are expected and can lead to confusion.

To fix this, we should explicitly define all the keyword arguments the function expects, and remove the use of `**kwargs`.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the use of `**kwargs` and explicitly defined all the keyword arguments the function expects. This makes it clear what arguments are required, and eliminates the need for capturing additional arguments using `**kwargs`.
