The error in the provided code lies in the function definition. The `**kwargs` parameter is used to collect all keyword arguments being passed to the function, but it should not be followed by other parameters. This is because `**kwargs` is used to capture any additional keyword arguments in a function call, and it should be the last parameter in the function's parameter list.

Below is the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```
