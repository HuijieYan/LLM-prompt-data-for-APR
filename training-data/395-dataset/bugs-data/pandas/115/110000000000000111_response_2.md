The error is related to the interpolation method 'index' when applied to a Series or DataFrame with an Index that is not sorted in ascending order. The error causes unexpected results when interpolating and the desired warning is not raised by the function.

The potential error location is within the conditional block that handles the 'index' interpolation method. It seems that the function is not checking whether the index is sorted in ascending order before performing interpolation.

The bug occurs because, when the 'index' interpolation method is used, the function does not check whether the index is sorted in ascending order. This can lead to unexpected results when interpolating because the 'index' method relies on the index values.

One approach to fix this bug is to add a check within the 'index' interpolation method block to verify if the index is sorted in ascending order. If it is not, the function should raise a warning as described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    
    # existing code...

    if method in ("values", "index"):
        if not xvalues.is_monotonic:
            raise Warning(
                "Interpolation method 'index' is being used on an Index that is not sorted in ascending order. "
                "This may lead to unexpected results in the output."
            )
        inds = np.asarray(xvalues)
        # hack for DatetimeIndex, #1646
        if needs_i8_conversion(inds.dtype.type):
            inds = inds.view(np.int64)
        if inds.dtype == np.object_:
            inds = lib.maybe_convert_objects(inds)
    else:
        inds = xvalues
    
    # existing code...
```

In the corrected code, a check has been added for the 'index' interpolation method to ensure that the index is sorted in ascending order. If the index is not sorted in ascending order, a warning will be raised as described in the GitHub issue.
