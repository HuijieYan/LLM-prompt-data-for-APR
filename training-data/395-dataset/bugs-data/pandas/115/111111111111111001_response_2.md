The bug in the `interpolate_1d` function seems to be related to the handling of the `limit_area` parameter. This parameter is being checked for values of "inside" and "outside" but is not being properly applied to the scenario. Additionally, there is an issue with the calculation of the `preserve_nans` variable. 

The bug occurs because the logic for handling the `limit_area` parameter is incorrect, leading to an incorrect application of NaN preservation in the interpolation process. This ultimately leads to incorrect interpolation results in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the approach would be to properly incorporate the `limit_area` parameter into the logic for preserving NaNs. Additionally, the calculation of `preserve_nans` should be revised to correctly determine which indices need to be preserved.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    # ... omitted code ...

    if limit_area is not None:
        valid_limit_areas = ["inside", "outside"]
        limit_area = limit_area.lower()
        if limit_area not in valid_limit_areas:
            raise ValueError("Invalid limit_area: expecting one of {}, got {}.".format(valid_limit_areas, limit_area))

    # Other parts of the function remain unchanged

    if limit_area == "inside":
        preserve_nans = mid_nans  # preserve NaNs at the middle
    elif limit_area == "outside":
        preserve_nans = start_nans | end_nans  # preserve NaNs at the start and end
    else:
        preserve_nans = set()

    preserve_nans = sorted(preserve_nans)

    # ... remaining code ...

    # Since this is a 1D interpolation, the overall logic and structure would remain similar but with the corrected handling of limit_area and the preservation of NaNs.
    # The interpolation method, Scipy methods, and other sections would not require much change.
```

With these revisions, the `interpolate_1d` function should now handle the `limit_area` parameter correctly and preserve NaNs based on the specified area for both forward and backward limits. This should address the interpolation issues observed in the test cases.
