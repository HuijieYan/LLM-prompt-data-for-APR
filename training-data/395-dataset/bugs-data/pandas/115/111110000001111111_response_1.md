The bug occurs in the `interpolate_1d` function, specifically in the section where the `method` parameter is handled. The method 'index' is not correctly handling the interpolation when the index is not sorted in ascending order.

The reason behind the bug is that when the method is 'index', the interpolation function should use the actual indices of the data rather than treating them as numeric values. In the provided bug case examples, the indices are not in ascending order, causing incorrect interpolation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the 'index' method differently, taking into account the actual index values of the data rather than treating them as numerical values for interpolation.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_scalar


def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    # (Previous code remains unchanged)

    if method == "index":
        result = yvalues.reindex(xvalues).interpolate(
            method="index", limit=limit, limit_direction=limit_direction, limit_area=limit_area,
            fill_value=fill_value, bounds_error=bounds_error, order=order, **kwargs
        )
        return result.values

    # (Remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, when the method is 'index', the function uses the `reindex` method to ensure the index values are preserved and then applies the interpolation. This approach properly handles the case where the index is not sorted in ascending order and avoids the issue of incorrect interpolation.
