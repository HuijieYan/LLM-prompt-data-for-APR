The bug occurs in the `interpolate_1d` function where the `method='index'` is used, causing unexpected results when the index is not sorted in ascending order. This results in inaccurate interpolation.

To fix the bug, the `interpolate_1d` function should check if the index is sorted in ascending order before performing the interpolation. If it's not sorted in ascending order, a warning should be raised to alert the user about the potential issues with the interpolation.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas._libs.algos as algos
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import needs_i8_conversion
from pandas.core.common import isna

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation. The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """

    # Check if the index is sorted in ascending order
    if not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing:
        raise Warning("Index is not sorted in ascending order, interpolation results may be inaccurate.")

    # Remaining code for the interpolation...
``` 

In the corrected code, the `is_monotonic_increasing` method is used to check if the index is sorted in ascending order. If it's not, a warning is raised to notify the user. This helps to prevent inaccurate interpolation results when the index is not sorted in ascending order.
