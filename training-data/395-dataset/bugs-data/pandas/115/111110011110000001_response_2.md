The error message indicates that there is a difference in the values of the series after interpolation. The expected values are not matching with the obtained values. This suggests that the interpolation function for unsorted indices is not working as intended.

The potential error location within the function could be at the interpolation step, specifically within the block of code that handles the "index" method. It seems that the interpolation method is not correctly handling the unsorted index when interpolating.

The bug is likely occurring because the interpolation method for "index" is not properly handling unsorted indices. When the test case sort the index in either ascending or descending order before performing interpolation, the resulting values are not as expected. This suggests that the interpolation method does not handle unsorted indices properly.

To fix the bug, the interpolation function should be modified to properly handle unsorted indices for the "index" method. This could involve sorting the index first and then performing interpolation, or modifying the interpolation logic to handle unsorted indices correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the interpolate_1d function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    if not isinstance(xvalues, pd.Series):
        xvalues = pd.Series(xvalues, name='x')
    if not isinstance(yvalues, pd.Series):
        yvalues = pd.Series(yvalues, name='y')
    combined = pd.concat([xvalues, yvalues], axis=1)
    combined = combined.sort_values(by='x')  # sort by x values before interpolation
    result = combined['y'].interpolate(method=method, limit=limit, limit_direction=limit_direction,
                                       limit_area=limit_area, fill_value=fill_value, axis=0)
    return result
```

In the corrected function, the xvalues and yvalues are converted to pandas Series if they are not already in that format. Then, both x and y values are combined and sorted by x values before interpolation using the built-in interpolate method of pandas. This ensures that the interpolation is performed correctly even on unsorted indices.
