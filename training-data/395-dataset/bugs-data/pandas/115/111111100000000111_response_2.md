The error seems to be related to the usage of the `method='index'` in the `interpolate_1d` function. The issue is that when calling `s.interpolate(method='index')` on a Series or DataFrame where the index is not sorted with `ascending=True`, it can lead to unexpected results.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section where the method 'index' is handled. The issue could stem from the assumption that the index is sorted with ascending=True.

To fix the bug, we need to perform a check to ensure that the index is sorted with ascending=True before applying the interpolation method 'index'. If it is not sorted as expected, a warning should be raised to alert the user that errors in the output could be possible.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def interpolate_1d(
        xvalues,
        yvalues,
        method="linear",
        limit=None,
        limit_direction="forward",
        limit_area=None,
        fill_value=None,
        bounds_error=False,
        order=None,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        # ... omitted code ...
        
        if method == "index":
            if not getattr(xvalues, 'is_monotonic_increasing', None):
                raise UserWarning("Warning: Interpolation using method='index' may result in unexpected output if the index is not sorted with ascending=True.")
            if not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing:
                raise UserWarning("Warning: Interpolation using method='index' may result in unexpected output if the index is not sorted with ascending=True.")
            
            # Rest of the code for handling interpolation with method='index'
            
        # ... omitted code ...

```
In the corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that the index is sorted with ascending=True before applying the interpolation method 'index'. If it is not sorted as expected, a UserWarning is raised to alert the user about the potential issue.
