The issue seems to be related to the `interpolate_1d` function, which is used for 1-dimensional interpolation in pandas. The error message is about raising a warning when calling `interpolate` with `method='index'` on a Series or DataFrame where the index is not sorted with `ascending=True`.

The potential error in the `interpolate_1d` function might be related to the logic for handling the 'index' interpolation method. It could be that the function does not properly handle the scenario where the input index is not sorted in ascending order.

The problem occurs because the function does not check whether the input index is sorted in ascending order when 'index' interpolation method is used. This can lead to unexpected interpolation results as demonstrated in the issue description.

To fix the bug, the `interpolate_1d` function needs to include a check for the sorted order of the input index when 'index' interpolation method is used. If the index is not sorted in ascending order, the function should raise a warning to alert the user about the potential for errors in the output.

Below is the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function incorporating the suggested fix:

```python
def interpolate_1d(x_values, y_values, method="linear", limit=None, limit_direction="forward", limit_area=None, fill_value=None, bounds_error=False, order=None, **kwargs):
    if method == "index":
        if not x_values.is_monotonic_increasing:
            import warnings
            warnings.warn("Input index is not sorted in ascending order. Unexpected interpolation results may occur.")

    # original code for interpolate_1d function
    # ... (rest of the function code)

    # return statement for the function
```

This modified function includes a check for the 'index' interpolation method to ensure that the input index is sorted in ascending order. If it is not, a warning is raised to alert the user to the potential for unexpected interpolation results.
