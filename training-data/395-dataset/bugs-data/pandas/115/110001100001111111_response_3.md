The bug occurs in the `interpolate_1d` function when the `method` parameter is set to 'index' and the index of the input array is not sorted in ascending order. This causes the interpolation to produce unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to provide a warning when the input index is not sorted in ascending order and the `method='index'` parameter is used. This will alert the user that errors in the output could be possible.

We should also ensure that the input index is sorted in ascending order before performing the interpolation.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import numpy.lib.index_tricks as itricks

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    
    if method == "index":
        if isinstance(xvalues, pd.Index) and not xvalues.equals(xvalues.sort_values()):
            # Raise a warning when the input index is not sorted in ascending order
            print("Warning: Input index is not sorted in ascending order, errors in the output could be possible.")
        
        # Sort the index in ascending order
        xvalues = xvalues.sort_values()
        yvalues = yvalues.loc[xvalues]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With these changes, the `interpolate_1d` function will now raise a warning when the input index is not sorted in ascending order and the method is set to 'index'. Additionally, it ensures that the input index is sorted in ascending order before performing the interpolation.
