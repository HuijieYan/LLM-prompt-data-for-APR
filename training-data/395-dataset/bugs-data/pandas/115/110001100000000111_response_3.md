The issue arises when calling the `interpolate` method with the `method='index'` parameter on a Series or DataFrame where the Index is not sorted with `ascending=True`. This can lead to unexpected results, as shown in the example provided in the issue description.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for the 1-d interpolation, specifically when the method is 'index', and it is attempting to interpolate the NaN values based on the index.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not check whether the index is sorted in ascending order before performing the interpolation. This can lead to incorrect results when using the 'index' method for interpolation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check to verify whether the index is sorted in ascending order before performing the interpolation. If the index is not sorted, a warning should be raised to alert the user about the potential for errors in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import algos

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.
    
    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Check if the index is sorted in ascending order
    if not xvalues.equals(np.sort(xvalues)):
        raise Warning("The index is not sorted in ascending order, which could lead to incorrect results.")

    # Rest of the code for interpolation remains the same as the original function
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, a check has been added to verify whether the `xvalues` index is sorted in ascending order. If it's not sorted, a warning is raised to alert the user about the potential for errors in the output.
