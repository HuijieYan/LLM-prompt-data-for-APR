The issue is occurring because the `interpolate_1d` function is not handling the case where the `xvalues` are not sorted with `ascending=True`. This results in unexpected behavior when using `method='index'` for interpolation.

To fix this issue, the `xvalues` should be sorted with `ascending=True` before applying interpolation.

Here's the corrected `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas._libs import algos

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    # Sort the xvalues with ascending=True
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(xvalues)
    xvalues = xvalues[sorted_indices]
    yvalues = yvalues[sorted_indices]

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

By sorting the `xvalues` with `ascending=True` at the beginning of the function, the issue of unexpected behavior when using `method='index'` for interpolation can be resolved. This ensures that the interpolation is performed correctly, regardless of the order of the `xvalues`.
