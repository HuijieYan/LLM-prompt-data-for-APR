The test case `test_interpolate_unsorted_index` is failing with an assertion error. The assertion error indicates that the interpolated values are different from the expected values.

Given that the test case `test_interpolate_unsorted_index` is related to the `interpolate_1d` function in the `missing.py` file, the potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the logic for 1-d interpolation.

The bug occurs because the `interpolate_1d` function does not handle unsorted index values correctly when using the `'index'` method for interpolation. This leads to unexpected results and fails the test case.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to implement the logic to sort the index values before performing the interpolation with the method set to `'index'`. Additionally, a warning should be raised to alert the user when calling `interpolate` with the `'index'` method on an unsorted index.

The corrected code for the problematic function `interpolate_1d` is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation. The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    if method == "index":
        if not xvalues.is_monotonic_increasing and not xvalues.is_monotonic_decreasing:
            # Raise a warning as the index is not sorted
            import warnings
            warnings.warn("The index is not sorted with ascending=True. Unexpected results may occur.")
            # Sort the index and corresponding values
            sorted_indices = np.argsort(xvalues)
            xvalues = xvalues[sorted_indices]
            yvalues = yvalues[sorted_indices]

    # Rest of the original logic for 1-d interpolation
    # ...

    return result
```

With this correction, the `interpolate_1d` function will sort the index and corresponding values when the method is set to `'index'`. Additionally, a warning is raised to alert the user about the unsorted index, providing an opportunity to address the issue.
