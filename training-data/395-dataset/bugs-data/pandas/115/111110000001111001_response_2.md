The bug occurs in the `interpolate_1d` function where the `preserve_nans` list is not being updated correctly based on the `limit_direction` and `limit_area` conditions.

The function's logic is designed to find and preserve NaN values within the interpolation process based on specified limits and directions. However, the check for `limit_area` is not correctly updating the `preserve_nans` set as intended.

To fix this issue, the `preserve_nans` set should be updated based on the conditions for `limit_direction` and `limit_area`.

Below is the corrected code for the `interpolate_1d` function:

```python
def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    # Existing code...

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    # if limit_area is set, add either mid or outside indices
    # to preserve_nans GH #16284
    if limit_area == "inside":
        if limit_direction == "forward":
            preserve_nans |= start_nans
        elif limit_direction == "backward":
            preserve_nans |= end_nans
        else:
            preserve_nans |= start_nans | end_nans
    elif limit_area == "outside":
        if limit_direction == "forward":
            preserve_nans |= end_nans
        elif limit_direction == "backward":
            preserve_nans |= start_nans
        else:
            preserve_nans |= mid_nans

    # sort preserve_nans and convert to list
    preserve_nans = sorted(preserve_nans)

    # Leave the rest of the code unchanged

    # Existing code...

```

In the corrected code, the set `preserve_nans` is updated based on the conditions for `limit_direction` and `limit_area` to accurately preserve NaN values during the interpolation process.
