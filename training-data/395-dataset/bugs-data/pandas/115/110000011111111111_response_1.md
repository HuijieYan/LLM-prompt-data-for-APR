The error occurs within the 'interpolate_1d' function. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect indices being used for interpolation due to the unsorted index. This leads to incorrect results in the test case, causing the assertion error.

The 'interpolate_1d' function uses the 'method="index"' for interpolation, but it does not handle unsorted indices correctly. As a result, it returns incorrect results for the test case.

To fix the bug, the 'interpolate_1d' function needs to check whether the index is sorted in ascending order before performing the interpolation. If the index is not sorted, the function should sort it in ascending order to ensure the correct results. Additionally, it should raise a warning to alert the user about the unsorted index.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def interpolate_1d(
    xvalues,
    yvalues,
    method="linear",
    limit=None,
    limit_direction="forward",
    limit_area=None,
    fill_value=None,
    bounds_error=False,
    order=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Logic for the 1-d interpolation.  The result should be 1-d, inputs
    xvalues and yvalues will each be 1-d arrays of the same length.

    Bounds_error is currently hardcoded to False since non-scipy ones don't
    take it as an argument.
    """
    
    if not pd.Index(xvalues).is_monotonic:
        warnings.warn("Input index is not sorted. Results may be unexpected.", UserWarning)
        xvalues, yvalues = zip(*sorted(zip(xvalues, yvalues)))

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the above corrected code, a warning is raised if the input index is not sorted. Then, the xvalues and yvalues are sorted in ascending order before further processing. This should ensure that the interpolation is performed correctly even with unsorted indices.
