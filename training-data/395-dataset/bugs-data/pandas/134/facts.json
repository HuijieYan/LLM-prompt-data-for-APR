Roll forward to\", date + 0 * workDay)\nProblem description\nHere's the output:\n\nLabor day 2021 is on DatetimeIndex(['2021-09-06'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='WOM-1MON')\nLabor day 2032 is on DatetimeIndex(['2032-09-06'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='WOM-1MON')\n\n2021-09-04 is a Saturday. Roll forward to 2021-09-07 00:00:00\n2032-09-04 is a Saturday. Roll forward to 2032-09-06 00:00:00\n\nThe calendar knows that Labor day is on Monday, Sept. 6 in both 2021 and 2032. However, when I ask to move to the next working day from Saturday, Sept. 4, I get the (correct) answer Sept.7 for 2021, but the (wrong) answer Sept 6 (which is Labor Day) for 2032.\n\nIs this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?\n\nThanks.\n\nNote: We receive a lot of issues on our GitHub tracker, so it is very possible that your issue has been posted before. Please check first before submitting so that we do not have to handle and close duplicates!\n\nNote: Many problems can be resolved by simply upgrading pandas to the latest version. Before submitting, please check if that solution works for you. If possible, you may want to check if master addresses this issue, but that is not necessary.\n\nFor documentation-related issues, you can check the latest versions of the docs on master here:\n\nhttps://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/\n\nIf the issue has not been resolved there, go ahead and file it in the issue tracker.\n\nExpected Output\n"
