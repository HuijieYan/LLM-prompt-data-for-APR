# Labor Day calendar

import pandas as pd
from pandas.tseries.holiday import AbstractHolidayCalendar, USLaborDay

class testCalendar(AbstractHolidayCalendar):
    rules = [
        USLaborDay,
    ]

cal = testCalendar()
workDay = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessDay(calendar=cal)

# Print dates of Labor Day
for yr in [2021, 2032]:
    print("Labor day", yr, "is on ",  cal.holidays(pd.to_datetime(str(yr-1)+'-12-31'), 
                                                    pd.to_datetime(str(yr) + '-12-31')))

print("\n")
                                                                   
# Check next working day for Saturday before Labor Day
for dateText in ['2021-09-04', '2032-09-04']:
    date = pd.to_datetime(dateText)
    print(dateText, "is a", date.strftime('%A') + ". Roll forward to", date + 0 * workDay)
Problem description
Here's the output:

Labor day 2021 is on DatetimeIndex(['2021-09-06'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='WOM-1MON')
Labor day 2032 is on DatetimeIndex(['2032-09-06'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='WOM-1MON')

2021-09-04 is a Saturday. Roll forward to 2021-09-07 00:00:00
2032-09-04 is a Saturday. Roll forward to 2032-09-06 00:00:00

The calendar knows that Labor day is on Monday, Sept. 6 in both 2021 and 2032. However, when I ask to move to the next working day from Saturday, Sept. 4, I get the (correct) answer Sept.7 for 2021, but the (wrong) answer Sept 6 (which is Labor Day) for 2032.

Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?

Thanks.
