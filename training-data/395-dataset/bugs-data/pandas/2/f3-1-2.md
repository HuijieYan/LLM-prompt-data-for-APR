Code Sample
# Your code here
import pandas as pd
s = pd.Series(index=pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([('a', 0)]))
s.loc['a', 0]  # loc function works fine, no complaints here
s.at['a', 0]  # raises TypeError
Stack Trace:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/core/indexing.py", line 2270, in __getitem__
    return self.obj._get_value(*key, takeable=self._takeable)
TypeError: _get_value() got multiple values for argument 'takeable'
Problem description
I would expect the at function to either return the values given by the indexers or raise a KeyError. In the above example, the index value exists, so at should return the value from the series at that index (nan).

The at function works fine for series with normal indexes. There is nothing in the documentation indicating it should not work for multi-indexes.

Expected Output
nan
nan
```
