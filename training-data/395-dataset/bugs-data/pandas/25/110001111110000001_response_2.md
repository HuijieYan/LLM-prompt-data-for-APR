Potential error location: The `isocalendar` function contains the bug, as indicated by the error message related to `assert_frame_equal` in the test function.

Reasons behind the bug occurrence:
The bug is likely due to the incorrect conversion of date strings to a DatetimeIndex object. This results in an inaccurate calculation of the ISO calendar year, week, and day.

Possible fixes:
1. The function should first convert the date strings to a DatetimeIndex using `pd.to_datetime`.
2. Then, the function should calculate the ISO calendar year, week, and day using the correct datetime index.

Corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
