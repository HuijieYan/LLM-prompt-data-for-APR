The potential error in the provided code is that the `isocalendar` function is using the `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` method which is not imported or defined in the given code. This is the reason for the bug in the code.

To fix this bug, the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method needs to be imported or defined. Assuming that it is defined in a separate module called `fields`, you would need to import the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method from the `fields` module in order to use it within the `DatetimeArray` class.

Assuming the method is defined in a module called `fields`, the corrected code is as follows:

```python
# import the build_isocalendar_sarray method from the fields module
from pandas import DataFrame
from pandas.core import arrays
from pandas.core import dtypes
from pandas.core import fields

class DatetimeArray(dtl.DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, dtl.TimelikeOps, dtl.DatelikeOps):
    # ... other code ...

    def isocalendar(self):
        """
        Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
        the ISO 8601 standard.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

        Returns
        -------
        DataFrame
            with columns year, week and day

        See Also
        --------
        Timestamp.isocalendar
        datetime.date.isocalendar

        Examples
        --------
        >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
        >>> idx.isocalendar()
           year  week  day
        0  2019    52    7
        1  2020     1    1
        2  2020     1    2
        3  2020     1    3
        >>> idx.isocalendar().week
        0    52
        1     1
        2     1
        3     1
        Name: week, dtype: UInt32
        """
        sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
        iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
            sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
        )
        if self._hasnans:
            iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
        return iso_calendar_df
```

This corrected code assumes that the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method is defined in a module called `fields`. If it is defined in a different module, you would need to import it from that specific module.
