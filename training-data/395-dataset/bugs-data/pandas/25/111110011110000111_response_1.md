The error occurs when comparing the expected DataFrame `expected_data_frame` with the result of the `isocalendar()` method on the `dates` object, which is an instance of `DatetimeArray`. The error message indicates that the values in the ExtensionArray are different.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `isocalendar` method, where the ISO 8601 standard for calculating the year, week, and day is not being correctly applied.

The bug occurs because the `isocalendar` method is not correctly implemented to calculate the ISO 8601 standard for the year, week, and day, and therefore the resulting DataFrame is not as expected.

The fix for the bug is to correctly implement the ISO 8601 standard calculation for the year, week, and day within the `isocalendar` method.

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class DatetimeArray(dtl.DatetimeLikeArrayMixin, dtl.TimelikeOps, dtl.DatelikeOps):
    """
    ... (other parts of the class definition) ...
    """

    # ... (other parts of the class definition) ...

    def isocalendar(self):
        """
        Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
        the ISO 8601 standard.
        """
        from pandas import DataFrame

        dt_index = DatetimeIndex(self.values)
        iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
            {
                "year": dt_index.year,
                "week": dt_index.week,
                "day": dt_index.dayofweek + 1  # Adding 1 to align with ISO 8601 standard
            },
            dtype="UInt32",
        )

        return iso_calendar_df
```

With this corrected implementation, the `isocalendar` method now correctly calculates the year, week, and day according to the ISO 8601 standard, and the test function should return the expected results without error.
