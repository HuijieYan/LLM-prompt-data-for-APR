Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `iso_calendar_df` DataFrame creation inside the `isocalendar` function. The week values are not calculated correctly, leading to a failed assertion in the test.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be due to incorrect week calculation while creating the `iso_calendar_df` DataFrame. The week values are being calculated using an incorrect formula or method, resulting in the wrong values being stored in the DataFrame.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the method used to calculate the week values in the `iso_calendar_df` DataFrame to ensure that the correct ISO 8601 standard is followed.
2. Ensure that the week calculation considers the transition between years, especially near the end and beginning of the year.
3. Check the correctness of the data used for week calculation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
