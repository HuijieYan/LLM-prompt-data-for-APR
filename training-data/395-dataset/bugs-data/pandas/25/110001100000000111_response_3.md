Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the line `iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None` where it is trying to assing `None` based on self._isnan index, but it should be using `self._hasnans` index instead.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the wrong index variable is being used to handle the NaN values. This leads to incorrect assignment of `None` to the NaN values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the correct index variable `self._hasnans` to handle the NaN values.
2. Check for NaN values in the input DataFrame before creating the iso_calendar_df and handle them appropriately.

Corrected Code:
```python
def isocalendar(self):
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.loc[self._hasnans] = None  # Correcting the index variable
    return iso_calendar_df
```
