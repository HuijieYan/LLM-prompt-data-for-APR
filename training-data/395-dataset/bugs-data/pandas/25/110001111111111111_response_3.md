The error message indicates that the `isocalendar` function is not returning the expected DataFrame. This function is called on a DatetimeIndex object with dates close to the new year and with a specified timezone.

Looking at the function, the bug may be caused by the `sarray` variable as it is derived from the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method and represents the year, week, and day from the input dates. This step might be generating incorrect values.

One approach to fix this bug is to inspect the logic within the `build_isocalendar_sarray` method. It may be incorrectly calculating the ISO calendar values, leading to incorrect results in the DataFrame.

Here is the corrected function/method:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_25/pandas/core/arrays/datetimes.py

from pandas import DataFrame

def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """

    iso_calendar_data = []
    for date in self:
        year = date.year
        week = date.isocalendar()[1]  # Get ISO week
        day = date.isocalendar()[2]  # Get ISO day
        iso_calendar_data.append((year, week, day))

    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        iso_calendar_data, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )

    return iso_calendar_df
```

This corrected function iterates through each date in the input and retrieves the ISO year, week, and day values separately, then constructs the DataFrame to return.
