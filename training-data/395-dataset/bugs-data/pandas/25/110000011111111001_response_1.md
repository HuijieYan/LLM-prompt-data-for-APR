The error occurs when the `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz` test case is executed. The error message indicates a mismatch in the values of the `ExtensionArray` when comparing the expected result with the actual result.

After analyzing the provided information, it seems that the bug is caused by an incorrect week calculation in the `isocalendar` function. 

The function should return a DataFrame with columns year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. In this particular case, the week calculation appears to be off.

To fix this bug, the week calculation inside the `isocalendar` function needs to be adjusted. 

One approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the week calculation is based on the ISO 8601 standard, taking into account the year boundaries and the start of the week defined by the standard.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = np.array(
        [
            (
                pd.to_datetime(val, utc=True)
                .to_pydatetime()
                .isocalendar()[0:3]
            )
            for val in self
        ],
        dtype=[("year", int), ("week", int), ("day", int)],
    )

    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32")
    return iso_calendar_df
```

With this updated code, the week calculation is based on the ISO 8601 standard, and the returned DataFrame will have the correct week values.
