Analysis:
The bug arises from the `isocalendar` method of the `DatetimeIndex` class. It is expected to return a DataFrame with the ISO 8601 standard year, week, and day, but it does not return the expected values for weeks close to the new year when a time zone is applied.

Error Location:
The error occurs in the `isocalendar` method when it calculates the ISO calendar values for dates near the new year.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the ISO calendar week is not calculated correctly for dates close to the new year, specifically when a time zone is applied.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the logic used to calculate the ISO calendar week to handle cases near the new year and to account for the time zone.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8, self.tz)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```
In the corrected code:
1. The `build_isocalendar_sarray` method is called with the `self.asi8` and `self.tz` as input to calculate ISO calendar values with consideration of the time zone.
2. The result is then used to create the DataFrame `iso_calendar_df` with the columns ['year', 'week', 'day'] and the specified data type 'UInt32'.
3. The code then checks for any NaN values and replaces them with None if present.
4. The corrected function now handles calculation of ISO calendar values near the new year and with respect to the time zone, fixing the bug in the original implementation.
