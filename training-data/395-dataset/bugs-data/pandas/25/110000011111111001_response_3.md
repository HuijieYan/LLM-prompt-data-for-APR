The error message indicates a problem with the `assert_frame_equal` function, specifically with the comparison of the `result` and `expected_data_frame` based on the 'ExtensionArray' values.

The potential error location within the `isocalendar` function is in the construction of the `sarray` variable and the subsequent DataFrame creation. It seems the week value is off by one when the year changes.

The cause of the bug could be the incorrect indexing of the ISO week, as ISO week numbering starts on a Monday, so the week 1 of a year is the first week to contain at least four days of the new year.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to subtract one from the week number whenever the day number is less than 4. This accounts for the ISO 8601 standard.

Below is the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also

    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2013-12-29', freq='D', periods=3, tz='Europe/Brussels')
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2013    52    7
    1  2014     1    1
    2  2014     1    2
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    weeks = sarray['week']
    years = sarray['year']
    # Adjust week number based on day of the week
    sarray['week'] -= (sarray['day'] < 4)  # Subtract 1 if day is less than 4
    # Handle the case where week 0 occurs in the previous year
    year_adjustment = -(weeks == 0)
    weeks = weeks + 53 * year_adjustment
    years = years - 1 * year_adjustment
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        dict(year=years, week=weeks, day=sarray['day']), dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

With this fix, the week numbers are adjusted according to the ISO standard, ensuring that the week numbering starts on Monday and is consistent with the expected behavior.
