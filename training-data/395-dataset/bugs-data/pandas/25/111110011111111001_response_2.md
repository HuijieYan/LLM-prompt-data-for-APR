The error occurs when the `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz` test case is executed. This test creates a DatetimeIndex `dates` with dates close to the new year and in the timezone "Europe/Brussels", then calls the `isocalendar` method on `dates` to get the ISO 8601 standard year, week, and day. The expected result is compared with the actual result using `tm.assert_frame_equal`.

The error message indicates that the `assert_frame_equal` check in the test case fails because the ExtensionArray values are different. Specifically, the values [2013, 2013, 2014] are expected, but [2013, 2014, 2014] are obtained. This means the calculated week-of-year values are incorrect.

The bug is likely in the `isocalendar` method where the ISO 8601 standard week-of-year is calculated incorrectly for dates close to the new year, which is causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating the ISO 8601 standard year, week, and day values based on the input date should be reviewed and corrected.

The corrected code for the `isocalendar` method is as follows:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
import numpy as np  # Add numpy import statement

# ... (other code)

def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    # Updated logic for ISO 8601 standard week-of-year calculation
    from pandas._libs.tslibs.timestamps import DatetimeIndex

    sarray = DatetimeIndex(self.asi8, tz="UTC").isocalendar()  # Calculate ISO 8601 standard values
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, the calculation is done using `DatetimeIndex(self.asi8, tz="UTC").isocalendar()` to ensure that the ISO 8601 standard year, week, and day values are calculated correctly based on the input date, and then returned as a DataFrame.
