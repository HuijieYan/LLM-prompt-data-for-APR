Potential error location: The `isocalendar` function within the `DatetimeArray` class is expected to return a DataFrame containing the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. However, it currently has a bug that causes the values to deviate, leading to a failed assertion in the test function.

Reasons for the bug: The bug seems to be related to the incorrect generation of ISO calendar values within the `isocalendar` function. The current implementation fails to generate the correct ISO calendar values, causing the assertion failure in the test function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `isocalendar` function should be modified to correctly calculate the year, week, and day according to the ISO 8601 standard. This might involve updating the logic used for generating the ISO calendar values.

```python
# Updated and corrected isocalendar function

    """

    the ISO 8601 standard.
