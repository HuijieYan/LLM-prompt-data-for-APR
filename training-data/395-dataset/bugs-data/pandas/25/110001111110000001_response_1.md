The test case `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz` is attempting to create a DatetimeIndex object with dates and a specified time zone, and then calling the `isocalendar` method on this DatetimeIndex. The result is then compared to an expected DataFrame.

The error message indicates that the ExtensionArray values are different. Specifically, the years do not match between the expected and actual results.

The potential error is in the `isocalendar` method provided. This method is supposed to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. However, it appears that the year is not being calculated correctly, resulting in mismatched values.

The bug may be occurring because the year calculation in the `isocalendar` method is not taking into account the time zone specified for the dates. This could lead to the incorrect assignment of dates to calendar years.

To fix this bug, the year calculation should consider the time zone of the dates provided. It may involve converting the provided dates to the specified time zone before calculating the year. Additionally, ensuring that the year, week, and day values are correct according to the ISO 8601 standard is important.

Here is the corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    from pandas import DataFrame
    import numpy as np

    # Converting dates to the specified time zone
    converted_dates = self.tz_convert(self.tz)

    # Calculating the year, week, and day
    year = converted_dates.year
    week = converted_dates.weekofyear
    day = converted_dates.dayofweek + 1  # Adjust for 1-based day of the week

    # Create a DataFrame with the calculated values
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame({
        "year": year,
        "week": week,
        "day": day
    })

    # Filling missing values with NaN
    iso_calendar_df = iso_calendar_df.where(~np.isnan(self), None)

    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, the dates are first converted to the specified time zone using the `tz_convert` method. Then, the year, week, and day values are calculated taking the time zone into consideration. Finally, the DataFrame is created with the calculated values and any missing values are filled with None.
