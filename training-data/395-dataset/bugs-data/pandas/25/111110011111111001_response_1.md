The error message is indicating that there is a difference in the values returned by the `isocalendar` function compared to the expected DataFrame. The specific difference seems to be in the 'year' column. The test case expects the 'year' values to be 2013, 2014, and 2014, but the actual values are 2013, 2013, and 2014, which indicates that the year calculation is off by one day.

Upon reviewing the buggy function, it appears that the bug may be related to the usage of the `self.asi8` array to calculate the ISO calendar values. The `self.asi8` array holds the timestamp in nanoseconds, and when it is used to construct `sarray` for the ISO calendar, it might be incorrectly handling the day calculation.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to adjust the timestamps appropriately to calculate the ISO calendar values accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8.astype("M8[D]"))
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, the `self.asi8` timestamps are first cast to a daily frequency using `astype("M8[D]")`. This ensures that the day calculation for ISO calendar is accurate.
