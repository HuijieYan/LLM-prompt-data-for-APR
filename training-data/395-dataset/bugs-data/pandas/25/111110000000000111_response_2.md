The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to access the attribute 'asi8' which does not seem to be defined anywhere in the code. This could be the reason for the bug.

To fix this bug, the function should directly take the datetime array and calculate the ISO calendar attributes without trying to access any undefined attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the 'isocalendar' function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = pd.Series(self).dt.isocalendar()
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame({
        'year': sarray.year,
        'week': sarray.week,
        'day': sarray.day
    }, dtype="UInt32")
    
    return iso_calendar_df
```

In this corrected code, the isocalendar function directly uses the pd.Series(self).dt.isocalendar() method to calculate the ISO calendar year, week, and day and then creates a DataFrame from the results.
