The test case creates a DatetimeIndex with dates close to New Year (2013/12/29, 2013/12/30, and 2013/12/31) and calls the isocalendar function. The expected result is a DataFrame with the year, week, and day values.

The error message indicates that the column values of the resulting DataFrame are different from the expected values. Specifically, the year and week values are off by one from the expected values.

The potential error location is within the `isocalendar` function, particularly in the conversion of dates to ISO calendar values.

The bug occurs because the conversion to ISO calendar values is not accounting for the correct week that certain days belong to. This can be due to how the ISO calendar computation is handled.

To fix the bug, assuming the issue lies in the computation of ISO calendar values, we need to ensure that the correct algorithm is used to determine the year, week, and day according to the ISO 8601 standard. It might involve adjusting the week calculation to align with the correct week of the year based on the ISO standard.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    jan2_monday = (3 - self.dayofweek) % 7 - 3
    start = Timestamp(self[0] - Timedelta(days=jan2_monday))

    day_zero = Timestamp(start.year - 1, 12, 29)
    four_day_earlier = Timestamp(start.year, start.month, 26)

    break_thursdays = 1 + ((start - four_day_earlier + pd.Timedelta(2, 'D')) // 7 // 52).astype(np.int64)

    week = 1 + ((self - day_zero + pd.Timedelta(2, 'D')) // 7 // 52).astype(np.int64)
    week[break_thursdays] = 1

    year = start.year + (week == 1) & (start.month == 1)
    day = self.dayofweek + 1

    return DataFrame({"year": year, "week": week, "day": day}, dtype="UInt32")
```

This corrected code uses a more accurate algorithm for calculating the ISO calendar values for the given dates, which should resolve the issue mentioned in the error message.
