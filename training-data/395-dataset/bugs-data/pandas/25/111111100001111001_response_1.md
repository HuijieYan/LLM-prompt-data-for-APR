The error seems to be in the `isocalendar` function. The error message isn't provided, but we have a discrepancy between the expected and actual case regarding the day value for the year 2013. In the expected case, the day for the first entry should be 6, while in the actual case, it's 7. This suggests the bug is likely in this section of the code where the day value is being calculated.

The cause of the bug could be related to the conversion between different timezones or misalignment of the values. This could result in off-by-one errors or other discrepancies in the calculated dates.

To fix this bug, we need to review the code where the day values are being calculated and ensure that the timezone conversions and date calculations are being performed correctly.

Here's the corrected `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0
