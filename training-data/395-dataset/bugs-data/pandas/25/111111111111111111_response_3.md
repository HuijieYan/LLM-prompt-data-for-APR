The provided error message indicates that the `assert_frame_equal` test failed due to differences in the `ExtensionArray` values. The expected values for the `isocalendar` method are not matching the actual output, resulting in the test failure.

The potential error in the `isocalendar` method might be related to the calculation of the ISO calendar week and day. The incorrect week and day values in the output DataFrame are causing the failure.

The bug is likely happening because the week and day calculation is not handling the transition from one year to the next year correctly, specifically close to new year.

To fix the bug, the `isocalendar` method should correctly handle the transition from one year to the next, ensuring that the week and day values are calculated accurately based on the ISO 8601 standard.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    # Adjust the local timestamps based on the timezone
    local_timestamps = pd.to_datetime(self.asi8, utc=True).tz_convert(self.tz)

    # Calculate ISO calendar attributes
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame({
        'year': local_timestamps.year,
        'week': local_timestamps.isocalendar().week,
        'day': local_timestamps.isocalendar().day
    }, dtype="UInt32")

    # Handle NaN values
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None

    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, the local timestamps are adjusted based on the timezone, and ISO calendar attributes are calculated correctly using the adjusted local timestamps. This should ensure that the ISO calendar values are computed accurately, addressing the bug and resolving the test failure.
