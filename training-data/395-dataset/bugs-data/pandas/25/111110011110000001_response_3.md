Potential Error Location:
The bug may be in the `isocalendar` method. When this method is called on an instance of `DatetimeArray`, it is returning incorrect values, leading to the assertion error in the test function.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `isocalendar` method is not implemented correctly. It seems that the logic or computation within the method is incorrect, causing it to return incorrect results, which then leads to the assertion error in the test function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use built-in pandas date manipulation methods to calculate the ISO calendar fields (year, week, day) accurately.
2. Ensure that the correct week number is assigned to each date close to the new year, as this is where the bug appears to be originating.
3. Check the handling of time zones and ensure that it does not affect the calculation of ISO calendar fields.
4. Correctly handle NaN values if present.

Corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:
```python
def isocalendar(self):
        """
        Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
        the ISO 8601 standard.
