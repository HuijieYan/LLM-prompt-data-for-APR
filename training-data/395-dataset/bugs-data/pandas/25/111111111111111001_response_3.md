The test case `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz` is trying to ensure that `isocalendar()` method of the `DatetimeIndex` returns the expected ISO calendar DataFrame. The test creates a `DatetimeIndex` instance and calls the `isocalendar()` method, comparing the result with an expected DataFrame.

The error message indicates that the `assert_frame_equal` function failed, specifically in comparing the `result` and `expected_data_frame` related to the `isocalendar()` method.

The potential error location within the `isocalendar()` method is the generation of the `sarray` using `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)`. It seems that the calculation for the ISO calendar is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the day of the week is incorrectly calculated close to the new year with a timezone. This is evident from the assertion error which shows that the days are not being calculated correctly.

To fix the bug, the part of the code that calculates the day of the week needs to be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar()` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day
