The error message indicates that the `isocalendar` function is not returning the expected results. It seems that the function is not returning the correct week for the given dates.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the implementation of the `isocalendar` method.

The bug occurs because the `isocalendar` function is not correctly calculating the ISO 8601 standard week for the given dates. This is resulting in incorrect values being returned, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `isocalendar` function needs to be adjusted to correctly calculate the ISO 8601 standard week for the input dates.

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------

    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    import numpy as np
    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = self.to_series().dt.isocalendar()  # Correct calculation using the to_series method
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    # Replace NaN values with None
    iso_calendar_df = iso_calendar_df.where(pd.notnull(iso_calendar_df), None)
    return iso_calendar_df
```

The corrected code uses the `to_series` method to convert the DateTimeIndex to a Series before applying the `isocalendar` method. Additionally, it correctly handles NaN values by replacing them with None in the resulting DataFrame.
