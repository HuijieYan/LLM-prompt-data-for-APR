The `isocalendar` function is meant to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. Looking at the input parameter values and types, the bug appears to be related to the fact that the ISO week calculation is offset by one day.

The issue seems to be that the week calculation is not aligned with the ISO 8601 standard, resulting in an incorrect week calculation. The occurrence of this bug is likely due to the discrepancy in the way the week calculation is being handled internally within the function.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to correct the week calculation so that it aligns with the ISO 8601 standard. This can be achieved by adjusting how the week is calculated in the `sarray` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
    def isocalendar(self):
        """
        Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
        the ISO 8601 standard.

        >>> idx.isocalendar()
           year  week  day
        0  2019    52    7
        1  2020     1    1
        2  2020     1    2
        3  2020     1    3
        >>> idx.isocalendar().week
        0    52
        1     1
        2     1
        3     1
        Name: week, dtype: UInt32
        """
        from pandas import DataFrame
    
        sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8 - 86400000000000)  # Subtract 1 day in nanoseconds to align with ISO weeks
        iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
            sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
        )
        if self._hasnans:
            iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
        return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, we have subtracted 1 day (86,400,000,000,000 nanoseconds) from the `asi8` array to align the week calculation with the ISO 8601 standard. This should resolve the bug and provide the expected result.
