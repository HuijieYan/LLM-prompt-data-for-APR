The test case `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz` is testing the `isocalendar()` function of the `DatetimeIndex` object. The test is creating a `DatetimeIndex` with dates close to the new year and then using the `isocalendar()` function to retrieve the year, week, and day of the dates.

The error message indicates that the expected DataFrame differs from the result returned by the `isocalendar()` function. Specifically, the obtained values are not as expected: [2013, 2013, 2014] instead of [2013, 2014, 2014]. This means that the `isocalendar` function is not providing the expected result.

The potential error location within the `isocalendar` method is related to the calculation of ISO 8601 year, week, and day using the `build_isocalendar_sarray` function. It's possible that the `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` function used in the `isocalendar` method might not be correctly calculating the week or year, leading to the unexpected results.

To fix this bug, the `build_isocalendar_sarray` function needs to be reviewed and corrected. If necessary, modifications should be made to ensure the correct calculation of ISO 8601 week and year.

The corrected `isocalendar` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
