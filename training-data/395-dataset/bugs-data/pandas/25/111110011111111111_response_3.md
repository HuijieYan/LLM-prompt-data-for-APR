The bug is located within the `isocalendar` function. The bug causes the function to return incorrect values for the ISO calendar.

The reason for the bug is that the week calculation is off by one day because the ISO week starts on Monday, but the original code starts on Sunday.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to adjust the calculation of the ISO calendar week by adding a day to the original weekday calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
