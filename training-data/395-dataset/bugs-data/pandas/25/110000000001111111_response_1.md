The bug in the provided `isocalendar` function is due to the incorrect representation of the ISO calendar format. The ISO calendar standard defines that the week day starts from Monday which should be represented as 1, and Sunday as 7. However, in the buggy function, the ISO calendar starts the week from Sunday and represents it as 1.

To fix this bug, the following changes need to be applied:
1. Subtract 1 from the 'day' component within `sarray` to represent the ISO calendar week starting from Monday instead of Sunday.
2. Replace the incorrect function for building the `sarray` with the correct function that accurately represents the ISO calendar.

The corrected code that implements the fixes mentioned above is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0
