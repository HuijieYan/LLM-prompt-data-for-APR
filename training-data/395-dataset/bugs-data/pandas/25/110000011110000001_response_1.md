The error message shows that the expected DataFrame values don't match with the actual values returned by the `isocalendar` function on `DatetimeIndex` objects. The bug seems to be in the `isocalendar` function in the underlying implementation of the `DatetimeIndex` class.

The potential error location is within the `isocalendar` function. The issue is likely related to how the DataFrame is constructed or how the iso_calendar_df is populated with values.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the iso_calendar_df DataFrame is populated correctly with the year, week, and day values. This might involve modifying how the iso_calendar_df is created or how the sarray is populated with values.

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
