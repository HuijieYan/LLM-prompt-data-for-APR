The test case is designed to check if the `isocalendar` method returns the expected DataFrame when called on a DatetimeIndex with dates close to the new year and with a specified timezone.

The potential error in the `isocalendar` method is in the line: `sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)`. This line seems to be responsible for calculating the year, week, and day according to the ISO 8601 standard.

The error message indicates that the expected and actual values are different. The raised AssertionError suggests that the calculated values differ from the expected values.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect calculations when building the `sarray` using `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)`. This could be due to incorrect handling of the timezone or incorrect calculation of ISO week numbers.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the `fields.build_isocalendar_sarray` function correctly calculates the ISO calendar components, taking into account the date/time and timezone information provided. Additionally, verify that the conversion to DataFrame and handling of missing/nan values is done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    # Calculate ISO calendar components
    year_week_day = self.strftime('%G-%V-%u').str.split('-', expand=True).astype("UInt32")
    year_week_day.columns = ["year", "week", "day"]

    # Create DataFrame
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(year_week_day, dtype="UInt32")

    return iso_calendar_df
```
In this corrected code, the ISO calendar components are calculated using the `strftime` method, which takes into account the date and timezone information, and then split into separate columns. This approach ensures correct handling of timezones and ISO week numbers and should address the bug.
