The error seems to be occurring due to a mismatch in the expected result and the result obtained from the `isocalendar()` function. The error message indicates that the year values are not matching with the expected values.

The potential error location within the `isocalendar()` function is the `build_isocalendar_sarray()` function. It seems that the `build_isocalendar_sarray()` function might not be returning the correct year, which is leading to the mismatch in the expected and actual results.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to the incorrect calculation of the ISO calendar year. This could be related to the handling of the year transition (e.g., from December to January). Additionally, there might be a mismatch in the handling of time zones, as the test case involves a `DatetimeIndex` with a specific time zone.

One approach for fixing the bug could be to check the logic within the `build_isocalendar_sarray()` function to ensure that it correctly calculates the ISO calendar year, week, and day, considering the transition between years. Additionally, handling of time zones should be consistent and accurate to avoid discrepancies.

Here's the corrected code for the `isocalendar()` function:
```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.
