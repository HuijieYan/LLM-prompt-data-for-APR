The function isocalendar is used to return a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to the ISO 8601 standard. The function currently accepts no parameters, but it should accept the instance of the class as 'self' as a parameter.

Given the parameters passed in Buggy case 1, the sarray variable is created using build_isocalendar_sarray and is of the correct type and value. The returned dataframe iso_calendar_df also has the correct type and value.

Therefore, the function is working as expected for the given test case.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    Examples
    --------

    from pandas import DataFrame

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    return iso_calendar_df
