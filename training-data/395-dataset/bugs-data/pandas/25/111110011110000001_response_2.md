The `test_isocalendar_returns_correct_values_close_to_new_year_with_tz` test case creates a DatetimeIndex called `dates` with three dates close to a new year, all in the same timezone. It then calls the `isocalendar` method on this DatetimeIndex and compares its output to an expected DataFrame.

The error message indicates that the `assert_frame_equal` method found a difference in the output DataFrame from `isocalendar` and the expected DataFrame. Specifically, there seems to be a difference in the year values.

Upon analyzing the `isocalendar` method, it appears that the bug may be in the calculation or extraction of the year value, leading to the mismatch with the expected DataFrame.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of time zone information when calculating the ISO calendar components. The `isocalendar` method should properly consider the time zone information of the dates when performing the ISO 8601 standard calculations.

To address the bug, the time zone information should be properly incorporated into the calculations, ensuring that the ISO calendar components are correctly determined based on the provided time zone.

Here is the corrected code for the `isocalendar` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx = idx.tz_localize('Europe/Brussels')  # Localize to the desired timezone
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame

    # Extract naive datetime from tz-aware datetime, if necessary
    if self.tz:
        self = self.tz_convert(None)

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None
    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, the `idx` variable is localized to the desired timezone using the `tz_localize` method before calling `isocalendar`. This ensures that the ISO calendar components are calculated with proper consideration of the provided time zone.
