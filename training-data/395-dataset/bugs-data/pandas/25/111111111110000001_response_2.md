The error message provided indicates that there is a mismatch in the values of the `ExtensionArray` returned by the `isocalendar()` function. Specifically, the year values are `[2013, 2013, 2014]` instead of `[2013, 2014, 2014]` as expected. This implies that there might be an issue with how the week or day is being calculated and assigned to the DataFrame.

The potential error location within the `isocalendar()` function is the logic for computing the ISO 8601 standard week. It seems that the implementation does not handle the transition between the last week of the previous year and the first week of the new year correctly, leading to the mismatch in values observed in the test case.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the computation of the week adheres to the ISO 8601 standard, considering the transition between years. This may involve updating the logic for computing the week such that it aligns with the ISO 8601 standard for week numbering.

The corrected code for the `isocalendar()` function is as follows:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    from pandas import DataFrame

    dt_series = pd.to_datetime(self.asi8, unit='ns', origin='unix')
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame({
        "year": dt_series.dt.isocalendar().year,
        "week": dt_series.dt.isocalendar().week,
        "day": dt_series.dt.isocalendar().day
    }, dtype="UInt32")

    if self._hasnans:
        iso_calendar_df.iloc[self._isnan] = None

    return iso_calendar_df
```

In the corrected code, `pd.to_datetime()` is used to convert the internal representation of datetime to a Series of datetime objects. Then, the `dt.isocalendar()` method is used to extract the year, week, and day according to the ISO 8601 standard. The values are then assigned to the DataFrame, and handling of NaN values is retained as in the original function. This approach ensures that the ISO week numbering is calculated correctly, resolving the bug observed in the test case.
