The potential issue in the function is with the `sarray` variable, which populates the `iso_calendar_df`. The bug arises from the incorrect calculation of the ISO calendar week's day component.

The day of the week is being calculated incorrectly, in the test case it is starting from 7 (Saturday) instead of 6 (Friday) i.e. the week's day is off by one.

The bug can be fixed by adjusting the day component of the ISO calendar week while populating the DataFrame `iso_calendar_df`.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    sarray = fields.build_isocalendar_sarray(self.asi8)
    sarray['day'] -= 1  # Adjust the day component by subtracting 1
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        sarray, columns=["year", "week", "day"], dtype="UInt32"
    )
    if self._hasnans:
