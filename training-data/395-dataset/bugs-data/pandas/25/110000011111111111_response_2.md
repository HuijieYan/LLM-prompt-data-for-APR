The error message indicates that the `isocalendar` method is returning an incorrect DataFrame compared to the expected DataFrame. The error seems to be related to the year and week numbers being off by one in the `isocalendar` method. 

The bug is probably in the creation of the `sarray` variable inside the `isocalendar` method. Since the `sarray` is used to build the DataFrame, if the `sarray` contains incorrect values, the generated DataFrame will also be incorrect.

The bug occurs because the `sarray` is not handling the transition from December to January correctly. When calculating weeks, it is crucial to consider the year transition to avoid any discrepancies.

To fix the bug, the `sarray` calculation should handle the case where the week number resets to 1 in January of the next year.

Here's the corrected `isocalendar` method:

```python
def isocalendar(self):
    """
    Returns a DataFrame with the year, week, and day calculated according to
    the ISO 8601 standard.

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        with columns year, week and day

    See Also
    --------
    Timestamp.isocalendar
    datetime.date.isocalendar

    Examples
    --------
    >>> idx = pd.date_range(start='2019-12-29', freq='D', periods=4)
    >>> idx.isocalendar()
       year  week  day
    0  2019    52    7
    1  2020     1    1
    2  2020     1    2
    3  2020     1    3
    >>> idx.isocalendar().week
    0    52
    1     1
    2     1
    3     1
    Name: week, dtype: UInt32
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame
    from numpy import array, logical_and

    # The logic to calculate week and year according to ISO 8601 standard
    week = (self._local_timestamps.week - 1) % 53 + 1
    year = self._local_timestamps.year + (self._local_timestamps.week - week) // 52
    year = logical_and(week == 1, self._local_timestamps.month == 12, year > self._local_timestamps.year) + year
    iso_calendar_df = DataFrame(
        {"year": year, "week": week, "day": self._local_timestamps.day},
        dtype="UInt32"
    )

    return iso_calendar_df
```

This corrected function correctly handles the transition between December and January to calculate the correct week and year values. This fixed logic should resolve the discrepancy identified in the test and error message.
