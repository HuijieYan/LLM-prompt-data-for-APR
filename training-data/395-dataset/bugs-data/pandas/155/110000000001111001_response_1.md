The error in the provided function is that it uses the `is` operator to check if `self.on` is None. However, for `Rolling` objects, `self.on` will never be None, so this check will always evaluate to False.

To fix this, we can modify the logic to check if `self.on` is in the columns of `self.obj` instead of checking if it is None.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

This fixes the issue by checking if `self.on` is present in the columns of `self.obj` for all the different cases provided.
