The bug in the provided function is that it tries to access the 'index' attribute of the DataFrame, which is incorrect in the context of a rolling window operation. The function should be modified to handle the rolling window operation correctly.

The reason for the bug is that when the function is called with a Rolling object as the input, it tries to access the 'index' attribute of the DataFrame, which can result in a ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the Rolling object input correctly and return the appropriate result for the rolling window operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj
    elif isinstance(self.obj, pd.core.window.Rolling):
        return self.obj
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

This corrected function checks if the input is a Rolling object, in which case it directly returns the object. If not, it checks if the 'on' attribute is None and returns the DataFrame itself. Otherwise, it raises a ValueError.

The corrected function now properly handles the Rolling object input and returns the appropriate results for the rolling window operation.
