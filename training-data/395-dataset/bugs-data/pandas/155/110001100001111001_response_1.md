The error in the provided function is due to the incorrect conditional statements and the incorrect return values. The function is supposed to return the `self.obj.index` if `self.on` is None, and return the index corresponding to the specified column if `self.on` is a column in the DataFrame. However, the function is not handling these conditions correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to properly check and return the expected values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return self.obj[self.on].index
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

In the corrected function, when `self.on` is not None and is a column in the DataFrame, we return the index corresponding to that column by accessing `self.obj[self.on].index`. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the different scenarios and returns the expected results.
