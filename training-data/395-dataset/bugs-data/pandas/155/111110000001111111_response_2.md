The error occurs in the `_on` method of the `Rolling` class when the `rolling` method is called with a DatetimeIndex for the columns. This causes a ValueError because the `rolling` method expects an integer value for the window, but the provided input is a string representing a time offset.

The potential error location is identified in the `_on` method where the window type is not being handled properly for DatetimeIndex with axis=1.

To fix this bug, the `_on` method needs to be modified to handle the case where the index is a DatetimeIndex and the rolling operation is performed along the columns (axis=1). In this case, the window argument should be converted from a time offset to an integer representing the number of time periods to include in the window.

Here's the corrected code for the `_on` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif self.axis == 1 and isinstance(self.obj.columns, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        window_value = pd.to_timedelta(self.window).to_period(self.obj.columns.freq).n
        return window_value
    elif self.axis == 0 and isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        window_value = pd.to_timedelta(self.window).to_period(self.obj.index.freq).n
        return window_value
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

With this modification, the `_on` method will properly handle the case where a DatetimeIndex is used for the columns and the rolling operation is performed along the columns (axis=1). It will convert the time offset to an integer representing the number of time periods to include in the rolling window.
