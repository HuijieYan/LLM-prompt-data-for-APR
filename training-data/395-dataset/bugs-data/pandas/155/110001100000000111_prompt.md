# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Rolling with offset and axis=1
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Code Sample
Here I have a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex for the columns:

cols = pd.date_range('2019-8-01', '2019-08-07', freq='D')
data = np.ones((5, len(cols)))
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=cols)
df.rolling('1d', axis=1).sum()
The above gives 'ValueError: window must be an integer'

Here I have a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex for the rows:

df2 = df.transpose()
df2.rolling('2d', axis=0).sum()
However this works totally fine.

Problem description
I believe there may be a bug: If I have a DatetimeIndex in the columns, specifying an offset for df.rolling does not work but gives a value error (that the window must be an integer). It works however as expected if I transpose the dataframe.
