The bug seems to be related to the `if` condition in the `_on` function. The function is trying to determine the type of the `self.obj` attribute using `isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame)`. However, `ABCDataFrame` is not imported anywhere in the code, which will cause a NameError. Additionally, the function should handle various conditions based on the input parameter `self.obj`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the different cases based on the type of `self.obj`. This can be done using a combination of `if-elif-else` statements to check if `self.obj` is a DataFrame or a different type of object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_on` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, pd.DataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return pd.Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

In this corrected code, I replaced `Index` with `pd.Index` as it's a better practice to reference classes from their original module. Also, I replaced `ABCDataFrame` with `pd.DataFrame` to handle different DataFrame types.
