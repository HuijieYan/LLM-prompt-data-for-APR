The issue seems to be occurring when using a `Rolling` object with a `DatetimeIndex` in the columns, as it results in a ValueError stating that the window must be an integer. This issue can be replicated with the given test cases, where the `Rolling` object is applied to a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex in the columns.

The error is likely to be in the `_on` method of the `Rolling` class. The bug occurs because the method does not handle the case of a DatetimeIndex in the columns properly, leading to a ValueError when trying to apply a rolling window operation.

To fix this issue, the `_on` method needs to differentiate between applying the rolling window to a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex in the columns and applying it to a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex in the rows. The method should be modified to handle the case of a DatetimeIndex in the columns by appropriately determining the index to be used for the rolling window operation.

The corrected code for the `_on` method could be as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        if isinstance(self.obj.columns, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            return self.obj.columns
        else:
            return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return pd.Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

This modified code includes a conditional check for the type of the DataFrame's columns. If the columns are of type `DatetimeIndex`, the method returns the columns as the index for the rolling window operation. Otherwise, it returns the DataFrame's index as before. This change should address the issue described in the bug report and allow for the proper application of a rolling window to a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex in the columns.
