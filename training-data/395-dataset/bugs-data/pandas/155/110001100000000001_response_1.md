Potential error location: The function is attempting to return a column as an Index object, but it is not doing so correctly.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because if the condition `isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns` is True, it doesn't return the column as an Index object correctly.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the condition `isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns` is True, then return the column as an Index object.
2. If the condition is False, return `self.obj.index`.

```python
# Corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):

    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return self.obj[self.on].index
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```
