The potential error in the provided function is that the `@cache_readonly` decorator is not a standard Python decorator, so it might be causing the issue.

The bug is likely occurring because `@cache_readonly` is not a valid Python decorator. It seems that the intended decorator might have been `@functools.lru_cache` for caching the result of the function. 

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to use the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator to cache the result of the `_on` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import functools

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Rolling(_Rolling_and_Expanding):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
    def _on(self):
        if self.on is None:
            return self.obj.index
        elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "invalid on specified as {0}, "
                "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
                "or None".format(self.on)
            )
```
