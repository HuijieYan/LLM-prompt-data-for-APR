The potential error in the provided function is that it is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator without it being imported or defined anywhere in the code. This can potentially cause a NameError.

To fix this bug, we can import the `@cache_readonly` decorator from the appropriate library. Assuming that the intention is to use a caching decorator for the `_on` function, we can replace `@cache_readonly` with a suitable caching decorator such as `@functools.lru_cache` from the `functools` library.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import functools

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Rolling(_Rolling_and_Expanding):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function with lru_cache decorator
    @functools.lru_cache
    def _on(self):
        if self.on is None:
            return self.obj.index
        elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "invalid on specified as {0}, "
                "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
                "or None".format(self.on)
            )
```
