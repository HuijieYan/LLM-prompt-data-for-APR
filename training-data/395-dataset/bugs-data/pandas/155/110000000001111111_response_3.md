The bug is likely in the condition that checks if the object is an instance of ABCDataFrame and the 'on' attribute is in the columns of the object. The bug seems to be caused by the function not handling the DateTimeIndex properly when it is in the columns of the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the case when the object has a DateTimeIndex in the columns properly. This can be done by checking the type of the index in the DataFrame and adjusting the logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected function/method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.DatetimeIndex):  # Check if the index is a DateTimeIndex
        return Index(self.obj.index)
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

In the corrected code, we check if the index of the DataFrame is a DateTimeIndex, and if so, we return the index itself. This will handle the cases where the DateTimeIndex is present in the columns of the DataFrame, fixing the bug.
