The bug is occurring in the `_on` function of the Rolling class. The function is supposed to return the index corresponding to the `on` attribute of the Rolling object. However, the bug is causing a ValueError to be raised when using a DatetimeIndex for the columns. The code is not handling this case properly and is expecting the window to be an integer, which is not the case when using offsets.

To fix the bug, the `_on` function needs to handle cases where the index is a DatetimeIndex for the columns. It should return the index in these cases without raising a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        if isinstance(self.obj.columns, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            return self.obj.columns
        return Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

This correction checks if the columns are a DatetimeIndex. If they are, it returns the columns as the index without raising a ValueError. Otherwise, it continues with the previous behavior of the function.
