The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the `if` condition where it checks if the object is an instance of a DataFrame and if the specified column is present in the DataFrame's columns. The error message "window must be an integer" suggests that the rolling window value is not being correctly recognized.

The bug occurs because when the DataFrame has a DatetimeIndex for its columns, the rolling window method fails to recognize the specified window value as a valid offset. This causes the function to raise a ValueError stating that the window must be an integer.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the scenario where the columns of the DataFrame contain a DatetimeIndex. Instead of checking for the presence of the specified window in the columns, it should handle the date offset directly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and isinstance(self.on, pd.DatetimeIndex):
        return Index(self.on)
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, must be a column (if DataFrame) or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

This modification directly checks if the specified column is a DatetimeIndex and returns it if present, allowing the rolling window method to work correctly with date offsets in the columns of the DataFrame.
