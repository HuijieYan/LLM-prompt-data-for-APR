The issue seems to be with the handling of rolling window on a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex in the columns when an offset is specified. The error message 'ValueError: window must be an integer' indicates that the rolling window is not being correctly handled when a DatetimeIndex is present in the columns.

The potential error location is within the `_on` method of the `Rolling` class, particularly in the handling of the rolling window when an offset is specified and a DatetimeIndex is present in the columns.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case of a DatetimeIndex in the columns when an offset is specified, leading to a ValueError due to the mismatch in the expected window type (integer) and the actual window type (offset).

One approach to fixing the bug is to check for the presence of a DatetimeIndex in the columns and handle the rolling window differently when an offset is specified. This may involve converting the offset to an integer based on the frequency of the DatetimeIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `_on` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        if isinstance(self.obj.columns, pd.DatetimeIndex) and self.on.freq is not None:
            freq_str = str(self.on.freq)
            offset = to_offset(freq_str)
            window = offset.nanos // 1e6  # convert nanoseconds to milliseconds
            return window
        else:
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

In this corrected code, we handle the case of a DatetimeIndex in the columns by converting the offset to an integer based on the frequency of the DatetimeIndex. This allows the rolling window to be correctly handled when an offset is specified.
