The bug seems to be related to the `self.on` attribute which is not being handled correctly in the `_on` function. The function is trying to determine the column to be used for the computation of the rolling or expanding window, but it is not handling the different formats of the datetime index that the DataFrame can have.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the different cases of the datetime index properly and select the correct column for computation.

Here is the corrected code for the `_on` function:

```python
# corrected _on function
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):

    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame):
        if self.on in self.obj.columns:
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
        else:
            # Check if the column name matches the datetime index format
            try:
                return self.obj[self.on]
            except KeyError:
                raise ValueError(
                    "invalid on specified as {0}, "
                    "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
                    "or a valid datetime index".format(self.on)
                )
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

With this correction, the function ensures that it properly handles cases where `self.on` refers to a column in the DataFrame as well as cases where it needs to work with the datetime index itself.
