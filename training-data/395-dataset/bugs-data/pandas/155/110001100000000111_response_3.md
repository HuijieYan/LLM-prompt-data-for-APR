Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the _on method as it is responsible for returning the index based on the specified 'on' attribute.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the _on method does not handle the case for a DatetimeIndex in the columns while using the rolling function. This causes a ValueError to be raised, as the window is expected to be an integer.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the _on method to handle the case of a DatetimeIndex in the columns when using the rolling function. This can be done by checking the type of index and returning the appropriate value accordingly.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_155/pandas/core/window/rolling.py

# corrected and fixed function

def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        if isinstance(self.obj.columns, pd.DatetimeIndex):  # Check if columns is a DatetimeIndex
            return self.obj.columns
        else:
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
