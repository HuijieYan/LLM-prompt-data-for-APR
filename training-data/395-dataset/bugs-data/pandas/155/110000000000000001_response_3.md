Potential error location: The issue might be with the function decorator `@cache_readonly`, as it is not a standard Python decorator and may be causing the function to not work as intended.

Reasons for the bug: The `@cache_readonly` decorator is likely a custom decorator that is not built into Python. It is possible that the decorator is not implemented correctly or is conflicting with the function behavior.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the `@cache_readonly` decorator and use a standard caching mechanism to achieve the desired behavior.

Corrected code:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError("invalid on specified as {0}, must be a column (if DataFrame) or None".format(self.on))
```
