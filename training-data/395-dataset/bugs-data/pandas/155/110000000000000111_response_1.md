The error message "ValueError: window must be an integer" indicates that there is an issue with specifying the window for the rolling function when a DatetimeIndex is present in the columns of the DataFrame.

In the provided function _on, the potential error location is within the conditional statement checking if the DataFrame has a DatetimeIndex in the columns.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where a DatetimeIndex is present in the columns of the DataFrame when specifying an offset for rolling. This results in the ValueError.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the case where a DatetimeIndex is present in the columns of the DataFrame and a rolling offset is specified. This could involve checking if the DataFrame has a DatetimeIndex in the columns and handling the offset appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        if isinstance(self.obj.columns, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            # Handle the case where a DatetimeIndex is present in the columns
            return self.obj.index
        else:
            # Handle the case where a DatetimeIndex is not present in the columns
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

This corrected function includes a conditional statement to check if the DataFrame's columns are of type pd.DatetimeIndex and handles the case accordingly.
