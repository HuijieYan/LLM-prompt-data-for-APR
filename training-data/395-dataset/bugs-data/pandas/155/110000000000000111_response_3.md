The error in the provided function seems to be related to the rolling window operation on a DataFrame with a DatetimeIndex for the columns. The test case provided in the GitHub issue demonstrates that specifying an offset for the rolling operation results in a ValueError, indicating that the window must be an integer.

Upon analysis, it seems that the bug is likely related to the check for the on attribute and the handling of the rolling window operation. The function attempts to validate the specified 'on' attribute and based on certain conditions, returns the index of the DataFrame. However, this validation logic seems to be incorrect, leading to the ValueError when using the rolling operation.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to correctly handle the validation of the 'on' attribute and ensure that the rolling operation works as expected for DataFrames with a DatetimeIndex for the columns.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif not isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) or self.on not in self.obj.columns:
        raise ValueError(
            "invalid on specified as {0}, "
            "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
            "or None".format(self.on)
        )
    return self.obj[self.on]
```

In the corrected function, the condition for checking if the DataFrame is an instance of ABCDataFrame has been updated, and the condition for raising the ValueError has been modified to ensure that the specified 'on' attribute is a valid column in the DataFrame. This modification should resolve the issue with the rolling window operation.
