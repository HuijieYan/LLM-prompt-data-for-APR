Potential error location:
The potential error in the provided function is the `isinstance` condition. It checks if `self.obj` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, but it should instead be checking if `self.obj` is an instance of `DataFrame`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks if `self.obj` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame` instead of `DataFrame`. This can lead to a ValueError being raised even when the condition is satisfied.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the `isinstance` condition to check if `self.obj` is an instance of `DataFrame` instead of `ABCDataFrame`. This will ensure that the correct type is being checked for the condition.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_155/pandas/core/window/rolling.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Rolling(_Rolling_and_Expanding):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    @cache_readonly
    def _on(self):
    
        if self.on is None:
            return self.obj.index
        elif isinstance(self.obj, DataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
            return Index(self.obj[self.on])
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "invalid on specified as {0}, "
                "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
                "or None".format(self.on)
            )
```
