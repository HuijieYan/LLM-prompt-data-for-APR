The bug occurs in the `_on` function, where the `self.on` attribute is checked, and it returns different results based on different conditions. The bug seems to be related to the `on` attribute not being properly handled.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `on` attribute is properly checked and handled for all cases. We can rewrite the function to handle the `on` attribute more robustly, ensuring that it covers all possible cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_on` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _on(self):
    if self.on is None:
        return self.obj.index
    elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
        return self.obj[self.on]
    else:
        raise ValueError(
            "Invalid 'on' specified: {0}, "
            "it must be a column (if DataFrame) or None".format(self.on)
        )
```

In the corrected code, we handle all possible cases for the `on` attribute, ensuring that it returns the expected value or raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function works correctly for all cases.
