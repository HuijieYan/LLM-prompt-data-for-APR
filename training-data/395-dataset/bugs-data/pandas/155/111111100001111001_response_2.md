The problem with the `_on` function is that it doesn't handle the different types of datetime indexes in the input DataFrame correctly. It only accounts for the case when the index is a regular DatetimeIndex, but it fails for other types, such as when the index includes time zones or is in a different format.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_on` function to handle different types of datetime indexes by checking the type of the index and extracting the datetime-like information accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas as pd

class Rolling(_Rolling_and_Expanding):
    # ... omitted code ...

    @cache_readonly
    def _on(self):
        if self.on is None:
            return self.obj.index
        elif isinstance(self.obj, ABCDataFrame) and self.on in self.obj.columns:
            return self.obj.index
        elif isinstance(self.obj.index, pd.DatetimeIndex):
            return self.obj.index
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                "invalid on specified as {0}, "
                "must be a column (if DataFrame) "
                "or None".format(self.on)
            )
```

In the corrected function, we added a new condition to handle the case when the index is a `DatetimeIndex` type. This condition returns the index itself, which covers all the cases for different types of datetime indexes.
