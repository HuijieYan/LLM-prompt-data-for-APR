The potential error in the provided code is that there are multiple defined functions with the same name "astype". This will cause conflicts and the program won't know which function to use when "astype" is called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "astype" function is defined multiple times in the code, making it ambiguous which one to use.

To fix the bug, we need to rename the "astype" function to something else to avoid conflicts. We can rename it to "astype_nansafe" to make it more specific to its functionality.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def astype_nansafe(self, dtype, copy=True):
    """
    Cast to a NumPy array or IntegerArray with 'dtype'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : str or dtype
        Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.
    copy : bool, default True
        Whether to copy the data, even if not necessary. If False,
        a copy is made only if the old dtype does not match the
        new dtype.

    Returns
    -------
    array : ndarray or IntegerArray
        NumPy ndarray or IntergerArray with 'dtype' for its dtype.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        if incompatible type with an IntegerDtype, equivalent of same_kind
        casting
    """

    # If we are astyping to an existing IntegerDtype, we can fastpath
    if isinstance(dtype, _IntegerDtype):
        result = self._data.astype(dtype.numpy_dtype, copy=False)
        return type(self)(result, mask=self._mask, copy=False)

    # Coerce
    if is_float_dtype(dtype):
        # In astype, we consider dtype=float to also mean na_value=np.nan
        kwargs = dict(na_value=np.nan)
    else:
        kwargs = {}

    data = self.to_numpy(dtype=dtype, **kwargs)
    return astype_nansafe(data, dtype, copy=False)
```
