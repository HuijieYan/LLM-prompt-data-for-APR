The bug occurs in the `_cat_compare_op` function, which is supposed to compare two categorical series. The error occurs when the function is trying to compare two Categorical objects and the categories are not ordered. 

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the comparison of unordered categories properly. It is raising a `TypeError` stating that "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not" for certain comparison operations. This is not the correct behavior for unordered categories, and it leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to handle the comparison of unordered categories appropriately. It should allow comparison operations for unordered categories as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cat_compare_op` function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            # TODO: Could this fail if the categories are listlike objects?
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            if set(self.categories) != set(other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same.")
            
            if not self.ordered and not self.categories.equals(other.categories):
                # both unordered and different order
                other_codes = _get_codes_for_values(other, self.categories)
            else:
                other_codes = other._codes

            f = getattr(self._codes, opname)
            ret = f(other_codes)
            mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other_codes == -1)
            if mask.any():
                # In other series, the leads to False, so do that here too
                ret[mask] = False
            return ret

        if is_scalar(other):
            if other in self.categories:
                i = self.categories.get_loc(other)
                ret = getattr(self._codes, opname)(i)

                if opname not in {"__eq__", "__ge__", "__gt__"}:
                    # check for NaN needed if we are not equal or larger
                    mask = self._codes == -1
                    ret[mask] = False
                return ret
            else:
                if opname == "__eq__":
                    return np.zeros(len(self), dtype=bool)
                elif opname == "__ne__":
                    return np.ones(len(self), dtype=bool)
                else:
                    raise TypeError(
                        f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {opname} with a "
                        "scalar, which is not a category."
                    )
        else:
            # handle other comparison scenarios
            return getattr(np.array(self), opname)(np.array(other))

    func.__name__ = opname
    return func
```

With this corrected code, the comparison of unordered categories should work as expected. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect comparison results and the associated test failures.
