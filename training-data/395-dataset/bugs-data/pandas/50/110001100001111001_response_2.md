The function `_cat_compare_op` is designed to generate a comparison function for specific comparison operations based on the input 'op'. The bug occurs within the function because attempts are made to modify the name of 'func' using `func.__name__ = opname`, which raises an error. 

To fix this bug, the assignment of `func.__name__` should be removed and the function should be modified to return the expected comparison function based on the input 'op'. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        # existing implementation details here
        pass

    return func
```
