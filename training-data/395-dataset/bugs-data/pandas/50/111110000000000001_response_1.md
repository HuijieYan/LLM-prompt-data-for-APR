The potential error in the provided function is that it is not handling the comparison operations (__lt__, __gt__, __le__, __ge__) properly for unordered categoricals. It is missing the condition to allow only equality or inequality comparisons for unordered categoricals.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the comparison operations for unordered categoricals. It mistakenly allows all comparison operations for unordered categoricals instead of only allowing equality or inequality comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the categorical is ordered or unordered, and only allow equality or inequality comparisons for unordered categoricals.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                )

        ...
        # rest of the code remains the same

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```
