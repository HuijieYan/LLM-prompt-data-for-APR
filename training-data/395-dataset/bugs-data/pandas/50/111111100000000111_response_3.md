The issue seems to be related to the behavior of NaN when comparing categories and strings. When using the `!=` operator with a `shift(1)` operation on a Series of category type, the output is not as expected when compared to a Series of string type. This indicates a discrepancy in the behavior of NaN values in the comparison operations between category and string types.

The issue likely arises in the `_cat_compare_op` function, specifically in the comparison operations involving the `NaN` values and how they are handled differently for category and string types.

To fix the issue, it could be necessary to introduce a separate handling mechanism for `NaN` values in the comparison operations in the `_cat_compare_op` function for category type to align its behavior with that of string type when it comes to comparison operations involving `NaN` values. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types.

Below is the corrected code for the `_cat_compare_op` function after addressing the discrepancy:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                )
        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            # Handling NaN values in comparison operations
            ret = self._codes.cat.codes if self._codes.dtype == 'category' else self._codes
            other_codes = other._codes.cat.codes if other._codes.dtype == 'category' else other._codes
            f = getattr(ret, opname)
            result = f(other_codes)
            result = result.where(~(self._codes.isna() | other._codes.isna()), False) # Handling NaN values
            return result

        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```
