The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the comparison operations between two categorical variables. The error message from the test function indicates that the comparison operations are not returning the expected results.

The buggy function seems to be designed to handle comparison operations between two Categorical objects. However, there might be issues with the comparison logic or with the way the underlying data (categories) are being handled.

Given the error messages, it seems that the comparison operations are not working as expected. This may be due to issues with how the categories are being compared or how the comparison logic is implemented in the function. Additionally, the comparison logic for other data types (like scalar values) might also need to be reviewed.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to thoroughly review the comparison logic in the function. It's important to ensure that the comparison operations correctly handle different scenarios, such as comparing categories, comparing with scalar values, and handling unordered categorical data. Additionally, the errors related to not handling NaN values and unordered categorical comparisons need to be addressed.

Here's a corrected version of the provided function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op}__"

    def func(self, other):
        if len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if op in ["lt", "gt", "le", "ge"]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                )

        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            if len(self.categories) != len(other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same. Categories are different lengths")

            if self.ordered and not (self.categories == other.categories).all():
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same.")

            if not set(self.categories) == set(other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same.")

            if not (self.ordered == other.ordered):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'ordered' is the same.")

            if not self.ordered and not np.array_equal(self.categories, other.categories):
                other_codes = _get_codes_for_values(other, self.categories)
            else:
                other_codes = other._codes

            f = getattr(self._codes, op)
            ret = f(other_codes)
            mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other_codes == -1)
            ret[mask] = False
            return ret

        if np.isscalar(other):
            if other in self.categories:
                i = self.categories.get_loc(other)
                ret = getattr(self._codes, opname)(i)

                if op not in {"__eq__", "__ge__", "__gt__"}:
                    mask = self._codes == -1
                    ret[mask] = False
                return ret
            else:
                if op == "__eq__":
                    return np.zeros(len(self), dtype=bool)
                elif op == "__ne__":
                    return np.ones(len(self), dtype=bool)
                else:
                    raise TypeError(
                        f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {op} with a scalar, which is not a category."
                    )
        else:
            if op in ["__eq__", "__ne__"]:
                return getattr(np.array(self), op)(np.array(other))

            raise TypeError(
                f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {op} with type {type(other)}.\nIf you want to compare values, use 'np.asarray(cat) <op> other'."
            )

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In the corrected code, the comparison logic has been updated to handle different scenarios and comparison operations more accurately. Additionally, there are checks in place to handle unordered categorical comparisons and NaN values.
