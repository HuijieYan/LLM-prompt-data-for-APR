The error occurs in the test function `test_not_equal_with_na` when it uses the `!=` operator to compare two Categorical objects. The test fails with an AssertionError because the result of the comparison is not as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison logic for Categorical objects. It seems that there may be a bug in the logic that compares the two Categorical objects using the `!=` operator.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely a flaw in the logic that handles the comparison of Categorical objects. The function may not be correctly comparing the categories and their lengths, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to review and update the logic for comparing two Categorical objects. Specifically, the logic for comparing the categories and their lengths needs to be carefully examined and corrected to ensure that the comparison yields the expected results.

The corrected function is provided below:

```python
# corrected function
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                )
        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            msg = "Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same."
            if len(self.categories) != len(other.categories):
                raise TypeError(msg + " Categories are different lengths")
            elif not set(self.categories) == set(other.categories):
                raise TypeError(msg)
            if not (self.ordered == other.ordered):
                raise TypeError(
                    "Categoricals can only be compared if 'ordered' is the same"
                )

            f = getattr(self, opname)
            return f(other)

        if is_scalar(other):
            if other in self.categories:
                i = self.categories.get_loc(other)
                return getattr(self, opname)(i)
            else:
                if opname == "__eq__":
                    return np.zeros(len(self), dtype=bool)
                elif opname == "__ne__":
                    return np.ones(len(self), dtype=bool)
                else:
                    raise TypeError(
                        f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {opname} with a "
                        "scalar, which is not a category."
                    )
        else:
            if opname in ["__eq__", "__ne__"]:
                return getattr(np.array(self), opname)(np.array(other))
            raise TypeError(
                f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {opname} with "
                f"type {type(other)}.\nIf you want to compare values, "
                "use 'np.asarray(cat) <op> other'."
            )

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
