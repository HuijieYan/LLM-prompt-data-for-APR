The bug in the provided function is likely causing the comparison of categorical data to fail. The function `_cat_compare_op` is designed to compare categorical data, but there seem to be issues with the comparison logic and error handling.

The bug occurs in the function's comparison logic, leading to incorrect comparison results or unexpected behavior. The function attempts to compare different instances of categorical data, and due to the buggy logic, it fails to perform the comparison accurately.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic should be reviewed and modified to ensure accurate comparison of categorical data. Additionally, the error handling within the function can be revisited and improved to provide informative error messages in case of comparison failures.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cat_compare_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _cat_compare_op(op):
    def func(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            if len(self.categories) != len(other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same.")
            if not np.array_equal(self.categories, other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same.")
            if self.ordered != other.ordered:
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'ordered' is the same.")

            return getattr(self._codes, op.__name__)(other._codes)
        elif is_scalar(other):
            if other in self.categories:
                i = self.categories.get_loc(other)
                return getattr(self._codes, op.__name__)(i)
            else:
                if op.__name__ == "__eq__":
                    return np.zeros(len(self), dtype=bool)
                elif op.__name__ == "__ne__":
                    return np.ones(len(self), dtype=bool)
                else:
                    raise TypeError(f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {op.__name__} with a scalar, which is not a category.")
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {op.__name__} with type {type(other)}.\nIf you want to compare values, use 'np.asarray(cat) <op> other'.")

    return func
```

In the corrected version, the comparison logic is simplified and the error handling is improved to provide clearer error messages. This should address the issues with the original implementation and ensure accurate comparison of categorical data.
