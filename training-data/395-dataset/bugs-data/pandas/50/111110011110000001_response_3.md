The error message from the test function is asserting that a comparison operation (`!=`) with the `Categorical` objects `c1` and `c2` is resulting in `False`. The actual result of the comparison is `[False, True]`. This implies that there is an issue with the comparison operation for `Categorical` objects.

Upon analyzing the provided `bucky` function, it seems that the issue might be related to the comparison of the Categorical objects using the `!=` operator. The comparison logic in the function may not be handling the `Categorical` objects correctly, resulting in incorrect comparison results.

The potential reasons behind the bug are:
1. Incorrect handling of the comparison logic for `Categorical` objects.
2. Incorrect application of the comparison operator within the `func` method.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `func` method needs to be modified to handle the `Categorical` objects correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `bucky` function:
```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            if len(self.categories) != len(other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same. Categories are different lengths")
            elif self.ordered and not (self.categories == other.categories).all():
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same")

            if not (self.ordered == other.ordered):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'ordered' is the same")

            if not self.ordered and not self.categories.equals(other.categories):
                other_codes = _get_codes_for_values(other, self.categories)
            else:
                other_codes = other._codes

            f = getattr(self._codes, opname)
            ret = f(other_codes)
            mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other_codes == -1)
            ret[mask] = False
            return ret
        else:
            return getattr(np.array(self), opname)(np.array(other))

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
``` 

The corrected function includes modifications in the comparison logic to handle `Categorical` objects correctly and return the expected results for comparison operations.
