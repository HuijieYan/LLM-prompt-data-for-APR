The buggy function `_cat_compare_op(op)` appears to be causing the error in the test cases. The comparison operation is not working as expected and is likely causing the test cases to fail.

The reason behind the bug could be due to the mismatch in comparison behavior for NaN values between Categorical and str data types. This could lead to unexpected behavior in comparison operations.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure that the behavior is consistent for both Categorical and str data types. This may involve modifying the comparison conditions and handling NaN values appropriately for both types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_cat_compare_op(op)`:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                )
        
        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            if not self.categories.equals(other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same.")
            
            other_codes = other.codes if self.ordered else _get_codes_for_values(other, self.categories)
            f = getattr(self.codes, opname)
            ret = f(other_codes)
        
            mask = (self.codes == -1) | (other_codes == -1)
            ret[mask] = False
            return ret

        if is_scalar(other):
            # Check for NaN and handle comparisons
            if pd.isna(other) and -1 in self.codes:
                result = opname in ['__eq__', '__le__', '__ge__']
                ret = np.full(len(self), result, dtype=bool)
                return ret
            else:
                i = other if other in self.categories else -1
                ret = getattr(self.codes, opname)(i)
                return ret

        # Handle comparison between Categorical and object dtype arrays
        if opname in ["__eq__", "__ne__"]:
            return getattr(np.array(self), opname)(np.array(other))

        raise TypeError(
            f"Cannot compare a Categorical for op {opname} with "
            f"type {type(other)}.\nIf you want to compare values, "
            "use 'np.asarray(cat) <op> other'."
        )

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In this corrected code, the comparison logic has been updated to handle NaN values and ensure consistent behavior for both Categorical and str data types. It also addresses the issues related to the mismatch in comparison behavior as described in the bug report.
