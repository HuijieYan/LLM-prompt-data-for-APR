The potential error location within the problematic function is in the if statement checking for the length of the 'other' variable. The error message says "Lengths must match", indicating that the function is expecting the lengths to be the same, but it is not properly handling the case where 'other' could be a single element or a list-like object.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that 'other' will always be a list-like object and compares its length with the length of 'self'. However, 'other' can be a single element, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if 'other' is a list-like object. If it is, then compare the lengths, otherwise just proceed with the operation assuming 'other' is a single element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            # TODO: Could this fail if the categories are listlike objects?
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                 )
        # rest of the code...
```
In the corrected code, 'is_list_like' is used to check if 'other' is a list-like object, and only if that condition is true the length comparison is performed. If 'other' is not list-like, the length comparison is skipped, and the function proceeds with the operation.
