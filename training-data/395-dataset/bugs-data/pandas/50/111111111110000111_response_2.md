The error occurs in the `_cat_compare_op` function of the `Categorical` class. The purpose of this function is to handle comparison operations (e.g., equality, inequality) for categorical data in Pandas.

The error is due to the incorrect behavior of the `!=` operator when comparing two `Categorical` objects that contain NaN values. The comparison operation leads to unexpected results.

The issue is likely caused by the way NaN values are handled within the comparison logic for `Categorical` objects. The current implementation does not handle NaN values properly, leading to incorrect comparison results.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `_cat_compare_op` function needs to be modified to handle NaN values correctly when comparing two `Categorical` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cat_compare_op` function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        # Check if the 'other' object is list-like and has the same length as self
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        # Handle comparison for NaN values
        ret = self._codes != other._codes
        if self._codes.isna().any() or other._codes.isna().any():
            ret[self._codes.isna() & other._codes.isna()] = False

        return ret

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In this corrected code, we introduced logic to compare the `_codes` attribute of the `Categorical` objects while handling NaN values correctly.

After making this change, the comparison logic for the `!=` operator should now handle NaN values properly and produce the expected results.
