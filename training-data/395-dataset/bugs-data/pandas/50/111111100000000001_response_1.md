Potential error location: The `opname` variable is used to construct the function name, but it's not being used consistently and might be causing issues.

Reason for the bug: The use of `opname` to construct the function name may not be consistent, leading to potential errors in function calls.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug: 
1. Ensure that `opname` is used consistently to construct the function name.
2. Verify that the function names constructed using `opname` match the actual function names in the code.

Corrected code:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            # TODO: Could this fail if the categories are listlike objects?
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered:
            if opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
                raise TypeError(
                    "Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not"
                )
        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            # Two Categoricals can only be be compared if the categories are
            # the same (maybe up to ordering, depending on ordered)
            msg = "Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same."
            if len(self.categories) != len(other.categories):
                raise TypeError(msg + " Categories are different lengths")
            elif self.ordered and not (self.categories == other.categories).all():
                raise TypeError(msg)
            elif not set(self.categories) == set(other.categories):
                raise TypeError(msg)

            if not (self.ordered == other.ordered):
                raise TypeError(
                    "Categoricals can only be compared if 'ordered' is the same"
                )
            if not self.ordered and not self.categories.equals(other.categories):
                # both unordered and different order
                other_codes = _get_codes_for_values(other, self.categories)
            else:
                other_codes = other._codes

            f = getattr(self._codes, opname)
            ret = f(other_codes)
            mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other_codes == -1)
            if mask.any():
                # In other series, the leads to False, so do that here too
                ret[mask] = False
            return ret
        
        # Rest of the function remains the same

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```
