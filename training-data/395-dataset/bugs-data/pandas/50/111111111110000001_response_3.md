The error message from the test function indicates that the assertion `assert result.all()` is failing, returning `False`. This suggests that there is an issue with the comparison operation performed in the `_cat_compare_op` function.

Upon analyzing the error message and test case, it seems that the issue occurs when comparing the two categorical objects created using the `Categorical.from_codes` method.

The potential error location in the provided `_cat_compare_op` function is in the code section where it handles the comparison of two Categorical objects.

The bug occurs because the comparison operation is not functioning as expected when comparing categorical objects with missing values (NaNs). The code does not correctly handle the comparison when one of the Categorical objects contains a missing value represented by -1.

To fix the bug, the comparison of the `self._codes` and `other._codes` should be handled properly to account for the missing values. Additionally, the comparison logic for unordered Categoricals is not handled correctly.

The corrected code for the `_cat_compare_op` function is as follows:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        if is_list_like(other) and len(other) != len(self):
            raise ValueError("Lengths must match.")

        if not self.ordered and opname in ["__lt__", "__gt__", "__le__", "__ge__"]:
            raise TypeError("Unordered Categoricals can only compare equality or not")

        other_codes = getattr(other, "_codes", np.asarray(other))
        f = getattr(self._codes, opname)
        ret = f(other_codes)
        mask = (self._codes == -1) | (other_codes == -1)
        ret[mask] = False  # Set comparison with missing values to False
        return ret

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In the corrected code, `other_codes` is retrieved properly from `other`, and the comparison logic handles missing values correctly by setting the comparison with missing values to `False`.

After applying this fix, the comparison operation should work as expected for the provided test cases.
