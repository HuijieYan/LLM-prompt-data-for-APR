The issue seems to relate to the behavior of NaN in comparison operators being different for `category` type and `str` type. The test case involves comparing two Series, where one is a category type and the other is a string type. When comparing the results of `shift(1) != df`, the behavior is different for category and str types.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the `func` method. There might be a mismatch or inconsistency in the behavior of comparison operators when handling NaN values for category and string types.

The bug is likely occurring because the `func` method does not handle NaN values consistently between category and string types, leading to different comparison results. This inconsistency might be due to how the `func` method is implemented, and it needs to be updated to handle NaN values consistently for both category and string types.

To fix the bug, the `func` method should be updated to ensure consistent handling of NaN values for category and string types in comparison operations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cat_compare_op(op):
    opname = f"__{op.__name__}__"

    @unpack_zerodim_and_defer(opname)
    def func(self, other):
        # Check if both are category types
        if isinstance(other, Categorical):
            # Check if the categories are the same
            if not set(self.categories) == set(other.categories):
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'categories' are the same")

            if self.ordered != other.ordered:
                raise TypeError("Categoricals can only be compared if 'ordered' is the same")

            # Handle NaN values consistently for both categories
            ret = pd.Series(self._codes, index=self.index).fillna(-1)
            other_codes = pd.Series(other._codes, index=other.index).fillna(-1)

            f = getattr(ret, opname)
            result = f(other_codes)

            # Handle NaN values in the result
            result[mask] = False
            return result

        # Handle other data types
        else:
            return func(self, other)

    func.__name__ = opname

    return func
```

In the corrected code, we added an additional check for consistent handling of NaN values for both category and string types. This ensures that the comparison operations produce consistent results for different types.
