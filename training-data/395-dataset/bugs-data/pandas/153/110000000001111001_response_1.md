The potential errors in the buggy function are related to the data type conversion and slicing of the 'values' array. The function aims to convert the input data to native types format and apply slicing if necessary. However, the use of slicing and data type conversion is not handled correctly, leading to incorrect output.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the slicing and data type conversion of the 'values' array. When the slicing and data type conversion are applied, the function does not correctly identify the desired behavior and produces incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that slicing is applied properly and that the data type conversion is performed accurately according to the specified conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[slicer]

    mask = pd.isna(values)

    if not self.is_object and quoting is None:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

In this corrected code:
1. We use 'pd.isna()' instead of 'isna()' to handle missing values.
2. We corrected the slicing implementation to ensure the correct operation.
3. In the condition `if not self.is_object and quoting is None`, we check if the 'quoting' variable is None instead of checking for a falsy value. This ensures that the condition is met when 'quoting' is not provided.
