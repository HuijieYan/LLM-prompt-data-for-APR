Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the data type being used to store the na_rep value in the values array, specifically when there is no quoting. The original code fails to update the data type of the values array to '<U6' when there is no quoting.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
When there is no quoting, the code tries to update the values array to 'str' type but what seems to be required is to update it to '<U6' type since that is the length of the 'mynull' string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the data type of the values array to '<U6' when there is no quoting.
2. Ensure that the data type of the values array matches the length of the na_rep value.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = isna(values)

    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        values = values.astype('<U' + str(len(na_rep)))  # Update data type to match the length of na_rep
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```
