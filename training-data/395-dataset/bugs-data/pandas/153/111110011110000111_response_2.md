The error is occurring due to the na_rep value being truncated when using the Int64 dtype in the DataFrame's to_csv function. This is revealed in the test function `test_to_csv_na_rep_long_string` which is failing with an assertion error.

The potential error location is likely within the `to_native_types` method of the `Block` class, as it is responsible for converting values to native types and handling the na_rep value.

The bug is occurring because, when the DataFrame is converted to the "Int64" dtype and then it is converted to CSV using the `to_csv` method, the na_rep value is being truncated.

To fix this bug, the `to_native_types` method needs to be updated to handle the "Int64" dtype properly and ensure that the na_rep value is not being truncated.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_native_types` method:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]

    mask = isna(values)
    
    if self.is_object:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")
    elif self.is_integer:
        dtype = values.dtype
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            values = values.astype(str)
        else:
            values = values.astype(object)
    else:
        values = values.astype(str)

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

This corrected code handles the conversion to native types based on the data type of the values. It ensures that when the dtype is "Int64", the na_rep value is not truncated. This should resolve the issue and the test case should now pass without any assertion errors.
