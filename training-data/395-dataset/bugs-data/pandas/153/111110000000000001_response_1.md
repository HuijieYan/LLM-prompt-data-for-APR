Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is with the line `mask = isna(values)`. There is no indication of how `isna` is being imported and used in the code, and it seems like this is a pandas function that is being called without the necessary import.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `isna` function is a pandas function that checks for missing or NA values in a DataFrame or Series. Since it is not explicitly imported, the code will throw an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary module that contains the `isna` function.
2. Check if the `isna` function belongs to a different module or library and import it accordingly.
3. Use the proper method for checking missing or NA values if `isna` is not the intended function.

Corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class Block(PandasObject):
    """
    Canonical n-dimensional unit of homogeneous dtype contained in a pandas
    data structure
    
    Index-ignorant; let the container take care of that
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def get_values(self, dtype=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def astype(self, dtype, copy=False, errors='raise', **kwargs):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
        """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """
    
        values = self.get_values()
    
        if slicer is not None:
            values = values[:, slicer]
        mask = pd.isna(values)  # Using the correct pandas function to check for NA values
    
        if not self.is_object and not quoting:
            values = values.astype(str)
        else:
            values = np.array(values, dtype="object")
    
        values[mask] = na_rep
        return values
```
