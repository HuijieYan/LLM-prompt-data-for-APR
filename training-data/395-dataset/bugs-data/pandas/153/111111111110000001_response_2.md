The error message is indicating that the expected result and the actual result from the function `to_csv` are not matching. Specifically, there is an assertion error with differences in the output related to the representation of NaN values as "mynull" in the CSV. This suggests that the function `to_native_types` might not be correctly handling the NaN values when converting them to the desired representation.

The potential error in the `to_native_types` function is that it is not correctly handling the NaN values when converting to native types and applying a replacement representation (`na_rep`).

The reason for the bug is that the `to_native_types` function is not correctly handling NaN values when converting to the desired native types and applying the replacement. It seems to be making assumptions about the structure of the data without properly checking for NaN values.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to explicitly check for NaN values and apply the replacement representation (`na_rep`) at the correct stage of the conversion to native types.

Here's the corrected code for the `to_native_types` function:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """
    
    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    
    if na_rep is not None:
        values[np.isnan(values)] = na_rep  # Replace NaN values with the specified representation
    
    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    return values
```
