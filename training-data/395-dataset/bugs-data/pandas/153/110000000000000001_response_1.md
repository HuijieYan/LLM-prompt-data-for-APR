The potential error in the provided function is related to the use of `self` within a standalone function. The `self` parameter suggests that this function should be a method of a class, but it is not currently written as part of a class. Additionally, the function uses methods like `get_values()` and `is_object` without defining them anywhere in the provided code.

To fix this, we need to either define the missing methods and variables or rewrite the function as a standalone function without using `self`.

Given the provided code, I will assume that the missing methods and variables are part of a larger class. The corrected code for the problematic function, assuming it is part of a larger class, would look like:

```python
import numpy as np

class ExampleClass:
    def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
        """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """
        values = self.get_values()

        if slicer is not None:
            values = values[:, slicer]
        
        mask = self.isna(values)

        if not self.is_object and not quoting:
            values = values.astype(str)
        else:
            values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

        values[mask] = na_rep
        return values
```

In this corrected code, I assumed that `isna()` and `is_object` are part of the class and replaced them with `self.isna()` and `self.is_object` respectively. Additionally, the entire function is now written as part of the `ExampleClass` class. If this function is meant to be a standalone function, then the `self` parameter should be removed, and any missing methods and variables should be defined outside of the function.
