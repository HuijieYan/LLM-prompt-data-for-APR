The potential error in the `to_native_types` function is in the line `mask = isna(values)`. This is likely raising an error because the `isna` function is not defined within the `Block` class, and it is not a built-in function in Python.

The error occurs because the `isna` function needs to be called from the pandas library which was not imported or referenced in the `Block` class.

To fix the bug, we need to import the pandas library and call the `isna` function on the `values` variable.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pandas as pd  # import the pandas library

class Block(PandasObject):
    """
    Canonical n-dimensional unit of homogeneous dtype contained in a pandas
    data structure
    
    Index-ignorant; let the container take care of that
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def get_values(self, dtype=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def astype(self, dtype, copy=False, errors='raise', **kwargs):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
        """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """
    
        values = self.get_values()
    
        if slicer is not None:
            values = values[:, slicer]
        mask = pd.isna(values)  # using pd.isna from the pandas library
    
        if not self.is_object and not quoting:
            values = values.astype(str)
        else:
            values = np.array(values, dtype="object")
    
        values[mask] = na_rep
        return values
```
