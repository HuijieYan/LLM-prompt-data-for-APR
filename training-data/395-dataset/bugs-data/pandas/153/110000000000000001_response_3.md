Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is the use of the `self` parameter outside the scope of a class method. The `self` parameter implies that this function is a method within a class, but it is defined as a standalone function.

Reasons behind the bug:
The use of `self` in a standalone function is incorrect and suggests that the function was intended to be a method within a class. This can cause errors related to the `self` parameter and the corresponding class attributes.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
If the intention is for the function to be a method within a class, it should be properly indented within the class and the `self` parameter should be used appropriately. If the intention is for the function to be a standalone function, the `self` parameter should be removed and any dependencies on class attributes should be passed as arguments to the function.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def to_native_types(values, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = np.isnan(values)

    if not np.issubdtype(values.dtype, np.object) and not quoting:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype=object)

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```
