The issue with the 'to_native_types' function seems to be related to the type of values that are being assigned to the 'values' variable, and the method to manipulate these values. The current function uses slicing and type conversion that seems to cause the incorrect output.

It seems that the 'values' variable is being converted to an object, and then assigning 'na_rep' value. The expected output indicates that the 'na_rep' should be applied directly to the 'values' array without prior conversion.

To fix the bug, we should remove the conversion of 'values' to an object and update the 'values' array directly with 'na_rep'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'to_native_types' function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[slicer]

    mask = isna(values)

    if quoting:
        # quoting is True
        values[mask] = na_rep
    else:
        # quoting is False
        values = np.array(values, dtype='U'+str(max(len(str(na_rep)), 1)))
        values[mask] = na_rep

    return values
```
