The error message indicates that the `na_rep` value is being truncated when using the `to_csv` method with an 'Int64' dtype. The expected result is not being achieved, and the values are being truncated.

The potential error location within the `to_native_types` method is that the code is converting the values to a native type format, but it is potentially causing the truncation of the `na_rep` value.

The bug occurs because when the values are being converted to the native type format, there is a conditional statement checking if the values are not of object type and if quoting is not provided. In this case, the values are being converted to string type, potentially causing truncation. Additionally, the conversion of values to 'object' dtype may also cause truncation.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `na_rep` value is not truncated when converting to native types. One approach is to modify the conditional statement to handle the 'Int64' dtype and not convert it to string type. Additionally, we can make the necessary adjustments to ensure the `na_rep` value is not truncated during the conversion.

Here is the corrected code for the `to_native_types` method:

```python
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = isna(values)

    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        # Handle 'Int64' dtype
        if self.dtype == 'Int64':
            values = np.array(values, dtype='Int64')
        else:
            values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

With these modifications, the buggy behavior causing the `na_rep` truncation for 'Int64' dtype should be resolved.
