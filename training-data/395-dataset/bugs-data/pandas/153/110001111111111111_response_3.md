The bug occurs in the to_native_types function, specifically in the line where the values are set to a string type using the astype method. The buggy code does not handle the case where the dtype is "Int64" and the na_rep is a long string.

The bug occurs because when the dtype is "Int64" and the na_rep is a long string, the replacement value is truncated to the length of the na_rep.

To fix the bug, you can modify the to_native_types function to handle the case where the dtype is "Int64" and the na_rep is a long string. This can be achieved by checking if the dtype is "Int64" and if the na_rep is a long string, then use the object dtype for the values.

Here's the corrected code for the to_native_types function:

```python
import numpy as np

# Relative function's signature in this file
def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = isna(values)

    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        if dtype == "Int64" and len(str(na_rep)) > 6:
            # Use object dtype if dtype is "Int64" and na_rep is a long string
            values = np.array(values, dtype="object")
        else:
            values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

This modification checks if the dtype is "Int64" and if the length of the na_rep string is greater than 6 (the maximum length of the string that can be stored in "Int64" dtype). If both conditions are true, then the values are cast to an object dtype to prevent the truncation of the na_rep string. Otherwise, the values are cast to a string as before.
