The bug is likely occurring in the section of code where the values are being converted to strings. The bug appears to be related to the truncation of values when na_rep is applied to columns with an Int64 dtype.

The bug occurs because the code is converting the values to strings using `dtype='<U6'` (unicode with length 6) instead of respecting the length of the na_rep string.

To fix the bug, the code should respect the length of the na_rep string when converting the values to strings. This can be achieved by setting the dtype to match the length of the na_rep string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = np.isnan(values)

    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        values = np.array(values, dtype=f'U{len(str(na_rep))}')
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype="object")

    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

With this change, the code will correctly handle the na_rep string length for columns with an Int64 dtype and avoid the truncation issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
