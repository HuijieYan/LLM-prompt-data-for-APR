Analysis:
1. The test case `test_to_csv_na_rep_long_string` is testing the behavior of `to_csv` method when `na_rep` is set to a long string ('mynull') and the dataframe has a column with 'Int64' dtype.
2. The error message indicates that the expected output is not matching the actual output, specifically in the values where 'mynull' is expected.

Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `to_native_types` function where the values are being manipulated and set to 'mynull'.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the values are being truncated when converting them to native types, resulting in 'myn' instead of 'mynull'.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the values are not truncated during the conversion to native types.
2. Check for any specific dtype conversion or manipulation that might be causing the truncation.
3. Reevaluate the process of setting 'mynull' as the na_rep and ensure it is properly applied to the dataframe.

Corrected Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def to_native_types(self, slicer=None, na_rep="nan", quoting=None, **kwargs):
    """ convert to our native types format, slicing if desired """

    values = self.get_values()

    if slicer is not None:
        values = values[:, slicer]
    mask = pd.isna(values)

    # Update the dtype conversion logic
    if not self.is_object and not quoting:
        values = values.astype(str)
    else:
        values = np.array(values, dtype=object)  # Use np.array instead of .astype

    # Check for na_rep and set it properly
    values[mask] = na_rep
    return values
```

After the corrections, the function will handle the dtype conversion without truncation and accurately apply the na_rep when converting to native types.
