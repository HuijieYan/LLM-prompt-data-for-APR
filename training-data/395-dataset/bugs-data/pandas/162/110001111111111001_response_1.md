The error message indicates a KeyError when attempting to drop the 'Sub-Total' label from the index. This suggests that the label 'Sub-Total' does not exist in the index, leading to the error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when dropping the 'margins_name' from the index: `index_margin = table.loc[margins_name, :].drop(margins_name)`

The bug occurs because the 'margins_name' label is used in the drop operation, but it's not present in the index. This results in a KeyError when attempting to drop a non-existent label.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic to first check if 'margins_name' exists in the index, and then perform the drop operation if it does. Additionally, we need to use the 'normalize' argument properly to ensure that the correct normalization operation is performed.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _normalize(table, normalize, margins, margins_name="All"):
    if not isinstance(normalize, (bool, str)):
        axis_subs = {0: "index", 1: "columns"}
        try:
            normalize = axis_subs[normalize]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")

    # Modify the logic to check if 'margins_name' exists in the index before dropping it
    if margins is False:
        if margins_name in table.index:
            index_margin = table.loc[margins_name, :].drop(margins_name)
            # rest of the code remains the same
        else:
            raise ValueError("margins_name not found in the index")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Not a valid margins argument")

    # rest of the function remains the same
    return table
``` 

This fix first checks if the 'margins_name' exists in the index before attempting to drop it, and raises a ValueError if it's not found. This prevents the KeyError that was previously occurring, and allows for proper error handling.
