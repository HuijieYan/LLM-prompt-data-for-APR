The bug is likely located in the `_normalize` function in the pivot.py file. The error message indicates that the `['Sub-Total']` is not found in the axis. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the margins are being handled when the `normalize` argument is set to True.

The bug occurs because when `normalize` is set to True and margins is also set to True, the code attempts to drop the margins_name, 'Sub-Total', from the table using `table.loc[margins_name, :].drop(margins_name)`. However, this results in a KeyError because the row with index 'Sub-Total' is not present in the table at this point.

To fix the bug, the handling of margins and normalization when both are set to True needs to be revised. One possible approach is to calculate the row and column margins separately outside the normalization step, and then append these margins back to the table after normalization.

Here's the corrected _normalize function:

```python
def _normalize(table, normalize, margins, margins_name="All"):
    if not isinstance(normalize, (bool, str)):
        axis_subs = {0: "index", 1: "columns"}
        try:
            normalize = axis_subs[normalize]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")

    if margins is False:
        # Actual Normalizations
        normalizers = {
            "index": lambda x: x / x.sum(axis=0),
            "columns": lambda x: x / x.sum(),
        }

        try:
            f = normalizers[normalize]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")

        table = f(table)
        table = table.fillna(0)

    elif margins is True:
        row_margin = table.sum(axis=1)
        col_margin = table.sum()

        table = table.div(row_margin, axis=0)
        table = table.div(col_margin, axis=1)
        
        # handle margins_name and append margins back
        if isinstance(margins_name, str):
            row_margin.name = margins_name
            table = table.append(row_margin)
            col_margin.name = margins_name
            table = table.join(col_margin, rsuffix='_margins')

    else:
        raise ValueError("Not a valid margins argument")

    return table
```

In this corrected function, the handling of margins and normalization when both are set to True has been revised to separately calculate row and column margins before the normalization step, and then append these margins back to the table after normalization. This should resolve the KeyError issue and provide the expected output for the test cases.
