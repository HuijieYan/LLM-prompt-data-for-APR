The test case is attempting to conduct a cross-tabulation using the `pd.crosstab` function and normalize the results along the index, columns, and both index and columns while including margins.

The error occurs when the test case attempts to normalize the data across index, columns, and margins. The error message indicates that the label "Sub-Total" is not found in the axis, resulting in a KeyError.

The bug is likely located in the `_normalize` function, specifically in the section where the code handles normalization across columns and indices with margins. This is evident from the error message indicating that the label "Sub-Total" is not found in the axis, which is a result of incorrect handling of index and column margins.

The reason for the bug is that the code is not correctly manipulating the index and column margins for normalization when margins are included in the computation.

To fix the bug, the `_normalize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle index and column margins when normalization is performed. The code needs to properly handle the addition of margins and their manipulation during the normalization process.

Here is the corrected code for the `_normalize` function:

```python
def _normalize(table, normalize, margins, margins_name="All"):
    if not isinstance(normalize, (bool, str)):
        axis_subs = {0: "index", 1: "columns"}
        try:
            normalize = axis_subs[normalize]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")

    if margins is False:
        # Actual Normalizations
        normalizers = {
            "all": lambda x: x / x.sum(axis=1).sum(axis=0),
            "columns": lambda x: x / x.sum(),
            "index": lambda x: x.div(x.sum(axis=1), axis=0),
        }
        normalizers[True] = normalizers["all"]
        try:
            f = normalizers[normalize]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")
        table = f(table)
        table = table.fillna(0)

    elif margins is True:
        if normalize == "columns":
            column_margin = table.sum(axis=0)
            table = table.div(column_margin, axis=1)

        elif normalize == "index":
            index_margin = table.sum(axis=1)
            table = table.div(index_margin, axis=0)

        elif normalize == "all" or normalize is True:
            column_margin = table.sum(axis=0)
            index_margin = table.sum(axis=1)
            table = table.div(column_margin, axis=1)
            table = table.div(index_margin, axis=0)

        else:
            raise ValueError("Not a valid normalize argument")

    else:
        raise ValueError("Not a valid margins argument")

    return table
```

In this corrected code, when margins are included in the normalization, the function correctly computes and adjusts the index and column margins to perform the normalization across both the index and columns while including the margins.
