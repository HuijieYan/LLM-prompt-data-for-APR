The error occurs because the `get_value` method is attempting to convert a `DecimalArray` to a numpy array, which results in an exception being raised.

The potential error location within the `get_value` method that could be causing this issue is the following line:
```python
s = com.values_from_object(series)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `values_from_object` function being called is likely trying to convert the `DecimalArray` object to a numpy array, which is causing the exception to be raised.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `values_from_object` function to handle `DecimalArray` objects differently and prevent the unnecessary conversion to a numpy array.

Here's the corrected `get_value` method:
```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):

    if isinstance(series, pd.Series) and isinstance(series.array, DecimalArray) and isinstance(key, slice):
        return series.array[key]
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...
```
