The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert a `DecimalArray` to a numpy array and raising an exception because of that. This is not the expected behavior as this conversion is unnecessary and potentially expensive. The code seems to have some logic that, when filtering a series with a mask, is causing the `ExtensionArray` to be converted to a materialized numpy array, which should be avoided.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it tries to get values from the `series` and `key` using `com.values_from_object(series)` and `com.values_from_object(key)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is attempting to convert the `DecimalArray` to a numpy array when it's trying to get the value from the series using the key. This conversion is not required and can be avoided.

To fix the bug, the unnecessary conversion of `DecimalArray` to a numpy array should be avoided. Instead, the process should directly get the value from the `series` using the `key`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # Directly get values without converting to a numpy array
    try:
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return series.iloc[iloc]
    except KeyError:
        if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
            raise
        elif is_integer(key):
            return series.iloc[key]
```
