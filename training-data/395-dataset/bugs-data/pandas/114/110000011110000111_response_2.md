The error message indicates that an exception is being raised when trying to convert a DecimalArray to a numpy array. This error occurs while trying to filter a series with a mask, which leads to materializing the ExtensionArray to a numpy array.

The issue likely lies within the `get_value` method of the Index class, which is called when filtering a series with a mask. The `values_from_object` function is used to retrieve the underlying values from the series, and this seems to be where the problem is occurring.

The bug occurs because the `values_from_object` function is not handling the DecimalArray type properly, leading to the attempt to convert it to a numpy array. This results in the exception being raised.

To fix the bug, the `values_from_object` function should be updated to handle the DecimalArray type correctly without attempting to convert it to a numpy array.

Below is the corrected `get_value` method with the updated `values_from_object` function:

```python
def values_from_object(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, DecimalArray):
        return obj
    return com._values_from_object(obj)

@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = values_from_object(series)
    k = values_from_object(key)

    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except KeyError as e1:
        if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
            raise

        try:
            return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
        except IndexError:
            raise
        except TypeError:
            # generator/iterator-like
            if is_iterator(key):
                raise InvalidIndexError(key)
            else:
                raise e1
        except Exception:
            raise e1
    except TypeError:
        # e.g. "[False] is an invalid key"
        if is_scalar(key):
            raise IndexError(key)
        raise InvalidIndexError(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `values_from_object` function checks if the object is an instance of DecimalArray and returns it directly without attempting to convert it to a numpy array. This resolves the issue with materializing the ExtensionArray unnecessarily when filtering a series with a mask.
