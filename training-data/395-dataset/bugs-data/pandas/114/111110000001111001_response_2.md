Potential error location: The function `get_value` is trying to handle different data types and index types but it is not doing so in an efficient manner, causing potential errors and performance issues.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. There is a mix of error handling mechanisms including try-except blocks and conditional statements, making it difficult to follow the logic and leading to potential errors.
2. The function is trying to handle different types of indices and data types in an ad-hoc manner, which can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues.
3. The function is trying to handle a range of exceptions but also raising new exceptions, resulting in unclear error messages and potentially redundant error handling.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use clearer and more consistent error handling mechanisms to improve the readability and maintainability of the function.
2. Streamline the logic for handling different index and data types to ensure consistent behavior and better performance.
3. Handle exceptions in a more controlled and specific manner to provide clearer error messages and avoid redundant error handling.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return s[iloc] if iloc is not None else s[key]
    else:
        try:
            s = com.values_from_object(series)
            k = com.values_from_object(key)
            k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
            return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
        except KeyError as e1:
            try:
                return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
            except IndexError:
                raise
            except Exception:
                if is_scalar(key):
                    raise IndexError(key)
                raise InvalidIndexError(key)
