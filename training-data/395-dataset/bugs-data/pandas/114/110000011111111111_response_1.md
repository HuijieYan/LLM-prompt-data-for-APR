The error message indicates that when the test function tries to filter a series with a mask, it densifies the ExtensionArray, which means it converts the ExtensionArray to a materialized numpy array. This can be inefficient, especially if the ExtensionArray doesn't store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

The problematic function is the `get_value` method, specifically the part where it calls `com.values_from_object(series)` and `com.values_from_object(key)`. This seems to be where the ExtensionArray is being densified.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_value` method is not handling ExtensionArrays efficiently when performing operations like filtering with a mask, leading to the densification of the ExtensionArray.

To fix this bug, the `get_value` method needs to be modified to handle ExtensionArrays more efficiently, so that densification is avoided where possible. Specifically, the `com.values_from_object` calls should be reviewed to check if they are necessary and find alternative methods to perform the desired operations without densifying the ExtensionArray when unnecessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # Replace this section with more efficient handling of ExtensionArrays
    # The goal is to avoid unnecessary densification
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return s[key]

    # Replace this with a more efficient way to handle ExtensionArray without densifying
    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)

    # The rest of the method remains unchanged
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except KeyError as e1:
        if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
            raise

        try:
            return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
        except IndexError:
            raise
        except TypeError:
            if is_iterator(key):
                raise InvalidIndexError(key)
            else:
                raise e1
        except Exception:
            raise e1
    except TypeError:
        if is_scalar(key):
            raise IndexError(key)
        raise InvalidIndexError(key)
```

By reconsidering how ExtensionArrays are handled in the `get_value` method, we can avoid densifying the ExtensionArray unnecessarily and resolve the bug described.
