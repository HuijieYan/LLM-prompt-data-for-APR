Analysis:
The error seems to be related to the behavior of ExtensionArray and how it impacts the performance of filtering a series with a mask.

Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the get_value method of the Index class in the base.py file.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the inefficient handling of ExtensionArrays, where a materialized numpy array is created, causing potential performance issues.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Optimize the handling of ExtensionArrays to avoid materializing numpy arrays unnecessarily.
2. Implement a more efficient approach for filtering series with a mask when ExtensionArrays are involved.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    if isinstance(series, Index) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)
        return series[iloc]
    else:
        return series[key]
```
This corrected code simplifies the handling of ExtensionArrays and optimizes the filtering process for series with a mask.
