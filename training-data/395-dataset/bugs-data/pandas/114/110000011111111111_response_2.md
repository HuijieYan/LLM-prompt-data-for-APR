The error message from the test function indicates that the `DecimalArray` is trying to be converted to a numpy array, which is not intended behavior and results in an exception. This conversion occurs when the `__array__` method is called from within the `DecimalArray` class.

It appears that the buggy function is the `get_value` method of a class, which is passed as a decorator to `@Appender`. The method attempts to fetch values from the series and carry out several checks before returning the resulting value.

The error occurs because the `get_value` method tries to convert the series to a numpy array within the function body, which should not be necessary and is causing the exception in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `get_value` method should avoid unnecessary calls to convert the series to a numpy array.

The corrected code for `get_value` method is as follows:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    if isinstance(series, DecimalArray):  # Check if series is an instance of DecimalArray
        return series.get_value(key)  # Obtain the value directly from the DecimalArray
    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid series type. Expected DecimalArray, got: ", type(series))

# Ensure the rest of the code in the class handles the DecimalArray appropriately
```

With this change, the `get_value` method checks if the series is an instance of `DecimalArray`. If it is, it fetches the value directly from the `DecimalArray`. If not, it raises a `TypeError` to handle the invalid type appropriately.
