The error occurs when trying to filter a series with a mask. The `get_value` function is identified in the error message as the problematic function because it is being called when performing the filtering operation.

The bug is likely caused by the implementation of the `get_value` function, where `values_from_object` is called. This conversion to values is likely causing the ExtensionArray to be materialized into a numpy array, which is not desired.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `get_value` function does not directly trigger materialization of the ExtensionArray unnecessarily. This can be achieved by reconsidering the use of `values_from_object` and other operations that may trigger materialization.

```python
    def get_value(self, series, key):
        # Original implementation
        s = com.values_from_object(series)
        k = com.values_from_object(key)
        k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
        try:
            return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
        except KeyError as e1:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            try:
                return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
            except IndexError:
                raise
            except TypeError:
                # generator/iterator-like
                if is_iterator(key):
                    raise InvalidIndexError(key)
                else:
                    raise e1
            except Exception:
                raise e1
        except TypeError:
            # e.g. "[False] is an invalid key"
            if is_scalar(key):
                raise IndexError(key)
            raise InvalidIndexError(key)
```

By reconsidering the use of `com.values_from_object` and other similar operations, the materialization of ExtensionArray should be avoided and the bug should be fixed.
