Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the section where the function is trying to get the value from the series using the key.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
There are multiple try-except blocks within the function, and it seems like the error handling and logic may not be properly structured. Additionally, the handling of different types of keys and series may be causing issues.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Reorganize the try-except blocks to have a clearer flow of logic and error handling.
2. Add more specific error messages to the raise statements to provide better information on what went wrong.
3. Check the type of key and series more explicitly to ensure the correct handling based on their types.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return s[key]

    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)

    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError) as e:
        if is_scalar(key):
            raise IndexError(key)
        raise e
```
