Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the `get_value` method of the Index class, specifically when dealing with ExtensionArray and Index-like objects.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
When an Index-like object, such as a DatetimeIndex, is used with the `get_value` method, the method relies on the `com.values_from_object` function to handle the values from the input series and key. The issue arises when dealing with ExtensionArray, leading to the densification of the array, which can be expensive.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic in the `get_value` method to handle ExtensionArray differently to avoid unnecessary densification.
2. Introduce checks to identify the type of object being dealt with and apply appropriate handling.

Corrected Code:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    if isinstance(series, ExtensionArray) and isinstance(key, (int, np.integer, bool)):
        # Handle ExtensionArray differently to prevent unnecessary densification
        return series[key]

    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)

    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except KeyError as e1:
        if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
            raise

        try:
            return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
        except IndexError:
            raise
        except TypeError:
            # generator/iterator-like
            if is_iterator(key):
                raise InvalidIndexError(key)
            else:
                raise e1
        except Exception:
            raise e1
    except TypeError:
        # e.g. "[False] is an invalid key"
        if is_scalar(key):
            raise IndexError(key)
        raise InvalidIndexError(key)
```
In the corrected code, we've added a check at the beginning of the `get_value` method to handle ExtensionArrays differently if the key is an int or boolean, avoiding the unnecessary densification issue.
