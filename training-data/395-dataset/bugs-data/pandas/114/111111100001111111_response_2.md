The issue described in the bug report is related to the `Index.get_value` method which is causing an ExtensionArray to be densified when filtering a Series with a mask, potentially leading to performance issues.

The error seems to occur in the `Index.get_value` method, specifically in the following part of the code:
```python
    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)
```

The call to `com.values_from_object` might be causing the ExtensionArray to be densified, leading to the performance issue.

The bug occurs because the `values_from_object` function may be converting ExtensionArrays to a materialized numpy array, which can be expensive when dealing with large datasets. This behavior was not intended and can lead to performance issues, especially when filtering a Series with a mask.

To fix the bug, the `values_from_object` function should be modified to avoid densifying ExtensionArrays unnecessarily. This can be accomplished by directly accessing the underlying data without converting it to a materialized numpy array.

Here's the corrected code for the `Index.get_value` method:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # Avoid densifying ExtensionArrays unnecessarily
    if isinstance(series, ExtensionArray) and is_scalar(key):
        return series[key]

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)

    # ... (rest of the code) ...
```

By directly returning the value from the ExtensionArray without converting it to a materialized numpy array, we can avoid unnecessary densification and improve performance.
