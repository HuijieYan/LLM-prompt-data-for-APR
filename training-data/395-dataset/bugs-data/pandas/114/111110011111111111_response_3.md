The error occurs in the `get_value` function of the `Index` class. The error message indicates that when applying a mask (e.g., `s > 0.5`), the `ExtensionArray` is converted to a materialized numpy array, which is an expensive operation and not desirable in this context.

The `get_value` function attempts to get the value from the index, which triggers the conversion to a numpy array, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the `get_value` function needs to be modified to avoid unnecessary materialization of the `ExtensionArray`.

Here's the corrected `get_value` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    # Performing the required operation without converting ExtensionArray to numpy array
    return series[key]
```

This modification ensures that the unnecessary conversion of the `ExtensionArray` to a materialized numpy array is avoided, resolving the bug related to materialization of the `ExtensionArray`.
