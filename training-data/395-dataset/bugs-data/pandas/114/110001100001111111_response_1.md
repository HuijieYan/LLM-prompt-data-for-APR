The error occurs when trying to use indexing (__getitem__) of DataFrame/Series with ExtensionArray, which densifies the array. The issue arises from the fact that when trying to get the value from the index inside the `__getitem__` method in the `pandas/core/series.py` file, it first calls `index.get_value()` before doing anything else.

The potential error location within the provided function is the `get_value` method, where it tries to get the value from the index object. This is causing the ExtensionArray to be densified, which can be very expensive.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_value` method is called before performing any other operations, resulting in the densification of the ExtensionArray.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `get_value` method to avoid densifying the ExtensionArray unnecessarily. This can be achieved by refactoring the method to first perform necessary checks and operations before calling `index.get_value()`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):

    # Check if the series is an ExtensionArray or Index, and if key is a scalar
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
                return s[key]

    # Convert series and key to their respective values
    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)

    # Convert key to a scalar indexer
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        # Get the value using the engine
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except KeyError as e1:
        if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
            raise

        try:
            # Get the value using libindex
            return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
        except IndexError:
            raise
        except TypeError:
            # Handle generator/iterator-like
            if is_iterator(key):
                raise InvalidIndexError(key)
            else:
                raise e1
        except Exception:
            raise e1
    except TypeError:
        # Handle invalid key error
        if isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
            raise IndexError(key)
        raise InvalidIndexError(key)
```
This corrected code includes additional checks and conditions to prevent unnecessary densification of the ExtensionArray, which should address the bug.
