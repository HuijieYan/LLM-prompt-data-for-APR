Potential error location: 

The potential error in this function is that the logic seems to be overly complex and difficult to follow. There are also multiple error handling sections that could be consolidated and simplified.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug might occur due to the complexity of the code, which makes it hard to debug and maintain. Additionally, the error handling seems to be fragmented and could be consolidated for better readability and maintainability.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Simplify the logic by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.
2. Consolidate the error handling sections to improve readability and maintainability.
3. Use descriptive variable names to better convey the purpose of each variable and make the code easier to understand.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)

    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except (KeyError, IndexError):
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(key):
                return s[key]

    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)
    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")

    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError) as e1:
        if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
            raise
        try:
            return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
        except (IndexError, TypeError):
            raise
        except Exception:
            raise e1
    except TypeError:
        if is_scalar(key):
            raise IndexError(key)
        raise InvalidIndexError(key)
