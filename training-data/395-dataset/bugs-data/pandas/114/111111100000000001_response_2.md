The problematic function is the `get_value` method in the `Index` class. The error seems to be related to how the function handles the `key` parameter and the `series` parameter. The function tries to convert the key to a location, and if that fails, it raises a KeyError if an integer index, otherwise, it checks if the key is an integer and tries that. There is also handling for ExtensionArray and Index types.

It's likely that the bug occurs due to improper handling of different types of keys and series, leading to potential errors with KeyError and IndexError.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to handle the different types of keys and series more consistently and perform appropriate checks before attempting to access the values.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except (KeyError, IndexError):
            pass
    
    try:
        k = com.values_from_object(key)
        k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
        return self._engine.get_value(com.values_from_object(series), k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError) as e:
        if not is_scalar(key):
            raise InvalidIndexError(key)
        else:
            raise IndexError(key)
```

In this corrected code, the function first checks if the series is an ExtensionArray or Index and handles the key accordingly. Then it attempts to convert the key and use the `_engine` method to get the value. Any potential errors are caught and handled appropriately.
