The error message indicates that when attempting to filter a series with a mask, the ExtensionArray is being converted into a numpy array, which is not the expected behavior and can potentially be very expensive.

The bug is likely occurring in the `get_value` method of the Index class in the `pandas/core/indexes/base.py` file. The method is trying to handle ExtensionArray objects by converting them to a location and then obtaining the corresponding value. However, there seems to be an unintended consequence of this handling, resulting in the densification of the ExtensionArray.

The reason behind this bug is that the `get_value` method is performing unnecessary array conversion for ExtensionArray objects when used in filter operations, leading to performance issues.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to enhance the logic within the `get_value` method to prevent the unnecessary densification of ExtensionArray objects. This may involve optimizing the process of obtaining the corresponding value without triggering the unintended array conversion.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_value` method:

```python
# Corrected get_value method
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)  # Get the values of the series
    k = com.values_from_object(key)  # Values from the key

    # Check if the series and key are of ExtensionArray type and scalar
    if isinstance(s, ExtensionArray) and is_scalar(key):
        iloc = self.get_loc(key)  # Get the location (iloc) of the key
        return s[iloc]  # Return the corresponding value from the ExtensionArray based on iloc
    else:
        # Perform other operations without unnecessary array conversion
        k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
```

In the corrected method, the logic is enhanced to handle ExtensionArray objects more efficiently, avoiding unnecessary densification when used in filter operations. This should resolve the bug where the ExtensionArray was being converted to a numpy array, which was not the intended behavior.
