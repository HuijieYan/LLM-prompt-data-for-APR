Potential error location: The bug seems to be related to the handling of Index-like data when attempting to get a value from a series.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The function first checks if the data is Index-like, and if so, tries to locate the key in the index using `get_loc(key)`.
2. If the previous step fails, it then tries to return the value directly from the series data using the key.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to handle the case where the key is not located in the index more effectively.
2. Improve the error handling and make the code more resilient to different data types and scenarios.

Corrected code:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_value"] % _index_doc_kwargs)
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(key)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            pass  # Do nothing if key is not found in the index

    s = com.values_from_object(series)
    k = com.values_from_object(key)

    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError):
        pass  # Handle different exceptions by doing nothing

    # Raise an error if the key is not found in the index
    raise KeyError(key)
```
