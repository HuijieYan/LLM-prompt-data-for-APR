The issue seems to be related to the `Index.get_value` function, specifically the part where it calls `values_from_object` on the `series` and `key`. This method is responsible for converting the input objects into values. 

The bug occurs when trying to filter a Series with a mask. The `get_value` function first converts the series and the key into values using `com.values_from_object`, which can cause ExtensionArrays to be densified (i.e., converted into a materialized numpy array). This happens on this line:

```python
s = com.values_from_object(series)
k = com.values_from_object(key)
```

This behavior is problematic, especially for large ExtensionArrays, as densifying them may lead to high memory consumption and decreased performance.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the `get_value` function to avoid densifying the ExtensionArray unnecessarily when it is being used as a mask for filtering a Series. Instead of calling `com.values_from_object`, it should check the type of the input and handle ExtensionArray differently to prevent densification.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_value` function:

```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = getattr(series, "_values", series)
    if isinstance(s, (ExtensionArray, Index)) and is_scalar(key):
        # Avoid densifying ExtensionArray
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
            k = key
        else:
            k = com.values_from_object(key)
        try:
            iloc = self.get_loc(k)
            return s[iloc]
        except KeyError:
            if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
                raise
            elif is_integer(k):
                return s[k]

    # ... rest of the function remains the same ...
```

In this corrected version, when the input `key` is an ExtensionArray or a numpy array, it directly assigns it to `k` without converting it into values. This change prevents unnecessary densification of ExtensionArrays.
