The error message indicates that when trying to filter a pandas Series with a mask, the ExtensionArray is being densified, i.e., it's being converted to a materialized numpy array. This can be inefficient if the ExtensionArray doesn't store a numpy array of scalars under the hood.

The reported issue is present within the `DecimalArray` test. The problem occurs during the filtering of the pandas Series. When a mask is applied to the series, the `ExtensionArray` behind the series is being densified, converting it to a materialized numpy array.

The issue arises from the `get_value` method in the `Index` class. This method is being called when filtering the series. The `values_from_object` function is being used within the `get_value` method to convert the series and key to values. This function ultimately leads to the densification of the `ExtensionArray`, causing the inefficiency.

To fix the issue, the `values_from_object` function in the `get_value` method should be modified. A possible approach to prevent the densification of the `ExtensionArray` would be to directly access the values without converting them unnecessarily.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_value` method:
```python
def get_value(self, series, key):
    s = series.values  # Directly access the values without unnecessary conversion
    k = key

    k = self._convert_scalar_indexer(k, kind="getitem")
    try:
        return self._engine.get_value(s, k, tz=getattr(series.dtype, "tz", None))
    except KeyError as e1:
        if len(self) > 0 and (self.holds_integer() or self.is_boolean()):
            raise

        try:
            return libindex.get_value_at(s, key)
        except IndexError:
            raise
        except TypeError:
            # generator/iterator-like
            if is_iterator(key):
                raise InvalidIndexError(key)
            else:
                raise e1
        except Exception:
            raise e1
    except TypeError:
        # e.g. "[False] is an invalid key"
        if is_scalar(key):
            raise IndexError(key)
        raise InvalidIndexError(key)
```
In this corrected version, we directly access the values of the series without unnecessary conversion, preventing the ExtensionArray from being densified.
