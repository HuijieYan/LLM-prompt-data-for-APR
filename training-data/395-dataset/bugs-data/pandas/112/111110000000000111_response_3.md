The error is occurring because the `pd.CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` does not support the `round` method as expected.

The potential error location within the code is the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_indexer` method does not handle the case where the index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This results in the `round` method failing when columns are a `CategoricalIndex` of `IntervalIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_indexer` method to properly handle the case where the index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(target.categories, IntervalIndex):
        return target.get_indexer(self)

    # Rest of the method implementation remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

By adding the condition to check if the `target` is a `CategoricalIndex` and its categories are of type `IntervalIndex`, we handle the case where the index is a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This fix should allow the `round` method to work as expected with `CategoricalIndex` columns created from `IntervalIndex`.
