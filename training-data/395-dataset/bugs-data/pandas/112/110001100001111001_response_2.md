The buggy function `get_indexer` is designed to act based on certain conditions. In the provided case, when `self.is_overlapping` is False, the function is supposed to execute certain code blocks based on the condition checks. However, the way the condition is defined (`if self.is_overlapping:`) does not effectively check the boolean value of `self.is_overlapping`. Instead, it checks whether it's None or not, which would always evaluate to True. This leads to the code execution within the condition block even when it's not supposed to.

To fix this, the condition checking should be modified to `if self.is_overlapping():`. This change ensures that the condition is checked based on the boolean value of `self.is_overlapping`, which will correctly execute the related code blocks.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the code remains the same
```
With this correction, the code will now properly check the boolean value of `self.is_overlapping` and execute the relevant code based on the condition.
