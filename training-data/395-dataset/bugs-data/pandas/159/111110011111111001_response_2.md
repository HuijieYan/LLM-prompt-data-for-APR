The issue is occurring due to a mismatch between the expected return value and the actual return value of the `_combine_frame` function when it is called with different inputs.

After examining the inputs and expected outputs for the two test cases, it appears that the issue lies within the `_combine_frame` function's implementation. The `_combine_frame` function seems to be performing arithmetic operations and should return results that match the expected value in the test cases. However, there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual results, leading to the test failures.

To fix this issue, the `_combine_frame` function needs to be modified to correctly perform the arithmetic operations and return the expected results.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    from pandas.core.ops import should_series_dispatch, dispatch_to_series, fill_binop
    
    this, other = self.align(other, join='outer', level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns
    
    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # fill binop between left and right
        new_left, new_right = fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(new_left, new_right)
    
    if should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

These changes revolve around consistently checking the input values, performing the operations, and returning the results back in alignment with the respective inputs and the return types of the function.

By making these modifications, the issues observed in the test cases can be resolved, and the function should return the expected results.
