The bug seems to be occurring in the `_arith_op` function within the `_combine_frame` method. When performing the division operation, the bug is not handling the case where the result should be `inf`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_arith_op` function to handle the case where the result should be `inf` for the division operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        result = func(left, right)
        result[left == 0] = np.inf
        return result

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the modified `_arith_op` function, after the `func` operation is performed, we check for elements in `left` that are equal to 0 and replace the corresponding elements in the result with `np.inf`.

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the division operation should handle cases where the result should be `inf` correctly.
