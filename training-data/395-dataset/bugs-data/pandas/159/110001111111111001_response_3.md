The `AssertionError` in the test cases indicates that the function is not returning the expected values. The variable `fill_value` is not correctly handled and may be the cause of the issue.

The function `_combine_frame` seems to have issues with the handling of `fill_value` when performing arithmetic operations on DataFrames.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `fill_value` is correctly used in the arithmetic operation to handle NaN or missing values.
2. If `fill_value` is present, it should be used appropriately to handle division by zero or invalid value errors.

The code can be corrected as follows:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns
    
    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)  # Apply fill_value
        return func(left, right)
    
    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the corrected code, `ops.fill_binop` is used to apply `fill_value` and handle any NaN or missing values appropriately during the arithmetic operation. This should resolve the issues and ensure the function returns the expected results.
