The issue seems to be related to the `rfloordiv` function of the DataFrame when using fill_value. The error message in the test case indicates that the division operation is not handling the fill_value=0 correctly, resulting in unexpected warnings.

The error is caused by the `_combine_frame` method not correctly aligning and handling the fill_value during the operation. This is leading to unexpected warnings and incorrect results in the test cases.

The approach to fixing this bug would be to modify the `_combine_frame` method to correctly handle the alignment and fill_value parameter during the operation. Additionally, proper error checks and handling of corner cases should be added to ensure consistent behavior.

Below is the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    # Align the frames
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Handle the fill_value during the operation
        if pd.isna(left):
            return fill_value
        if pd.isna(right):
            return fill_value
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # Iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

With these changes, the `_combine_frame` method should now correctly handle the alignment and fill_value parameters, resolving the bug related to unexpected warnings and incorrect results in the test cases.
