The bug in the `DataFrame._combine_frame` function seems to be related to the division operation (`rfloordiv`) with the `fill_value` parameter. The bug specifically involves the handling of different index and column alignment.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling the fill_value correctly when performing the division operation. This results in unexpected behavior and warning messages.

To fix the bug, the `DataFrame._combine_frame` function should be updated to handle the division operation with the `fill_value` parameter more effectively, especially when dealing with different index and column alignments.

Here's the corrected code for the `DataFrame._combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    result = _arith_op(this, other)
    return self._constructor(
        result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
    )
```

This corrected code ensures that the `fill_value` is correctly applied when performing the division operation, and it handles different index and column alignments effectively.
