The issue in the `_combine_frame` method appears to be related to the method `_arith_op` not being defined properly. Additionally, there appears to be an issue with the alignment of the data frames `self` and `other` before performing the arithmetic operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this_other_aligned = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    this, other = this_other_aligned[0], this_other_aligned[1]
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns
    
    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)
    
    result = ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

In the corrected method, we first align the data frames `self` and `other` to ensure that they share the same index and column labels. Then, we define the `_arith_op` method properly and use it to perform the arithmetic operation. Finally, we construct a new DataFrame using the results and return it.

These corrections should resolve the issues experienced in the test function and ensure that the method works as expected.
