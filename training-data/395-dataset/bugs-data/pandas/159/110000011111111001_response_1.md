The error occurs due to a bug in the `_arith_op` function in the `DataFrame._combine_frame` method. The bug causes unexpected results for arithmetic operations between two DataFrames.

The issue with the `_arith_op` function is that it does not handle NaN or inf values correctly when performing arithmetic operations. This leads to incorrect results when divided by 0, encountering inf, or encountering NaN.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_arith_op` function correctly handles NaN and inf values during arithmetic operations. We can also improve error handling to avoid unexpected results during these operations.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Corrected function
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Handle NaN, inf, and invalid division
        try:
            result = func(left, right)
        except ZeroDivisionError as e:
            result = np.inf if np.isclose(left, 0) and np.isclose(right, 0) else np.nan
        except FloatingPointError as e:
            result = np.nan
        return result

    if this.isna().any().any() or other.isna().any().any():
        return pd.DataFrame(index=new_index, columns=new_columns)
    
    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `_arith_op` function uses a try-except block to handle ZeroDivisionError and FloatingPointError, ensuring that it returns the correct result for division operations involving zero, inf, and NaN. Additionally, the corrected code handles cases where the input DataFrames have NaN values by returning an empty DataFrame to avoid unexpected results.

These changes address the issues causing unexpected results in the arithmetic operations in the original function.
