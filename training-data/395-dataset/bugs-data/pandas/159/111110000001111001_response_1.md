The bug is caused by the wrong variable assignment in the `_combine_frame` function. The `this` and `other` variables are being assigned using the `align` method, but it seems that the align method is not returning the expected values.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `align` method is providing the correct values for `this` and `other`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this = self.copy()
    other = other.copy()
    this, other = this.align(
        other, join='outer', level=level, copy=False
    )
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In this corrected code, we are using the `align` method to create new aligned DataFrames `this` and `other`. Then, we extract index and column information from `this` and perform the arithmetic operation. Finally, the result is used to create a new DataFrame with the given index and columns.
