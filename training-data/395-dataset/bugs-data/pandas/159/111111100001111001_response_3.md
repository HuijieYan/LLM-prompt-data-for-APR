The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect usage and handling of the `align` method within the `_combine_frame` function. This is leading to incorrect alignments and subsequent errors in the function.

To fix the bug:
- We can ensure that the `align` method is called with the correct parameters and its return values are correctly used.
- Make sure that the `left` and `right` variables are aligned properly before using them in the `_arith_op` function.
- Ensure that the `_arith_op` function operates on the aligned arrays properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    # Correctly align the data
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
  
    # Get the index and columns after alignment
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns
    
    # Ensure the data types are matched for arithmetic operations
    left, right = this.values.astype(float), other.values.astype(float)
    
    # Perform the arithmetic operation
    result = func(left, right)
  
    # Construct the resulting DataFrame using the original constructor
    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns)
```
