The error messages indicate issues related to the division operation in the DataFrame. The error seems to occur when handling fill values for division operations in the DataFrame.

Upon further analysis, the `_combine_frame` function takes two DataFrames and applies a binary operation (`func`) to combine them. The issue might be related to how the function handles the `fill_value` parameter during the operation, particularly with the `rfloordiv` and `div` operations.

The bug might be occurring due to how the `fill_value` is propagated through the division process within the `_combine_frame` function, leading to unexpected results and possibly causing RuntimeWarnings.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if the `fill_value` is correctly handled during the division operation.
2. Ensure that the fill value is correctly used in the division process when aligning different columns and index.
3. Handle the `fill_value` for different division operations like `rfloordiv` and `div` appropriately.

Here's the corrected `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        # Check if division operation and apply fill_value accordingly
        if func.__name__ in ["rfloordiv", "div"]:
            result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
            return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
        else:
            # For other operations, apply fill_value normally
            left, right = ops.fill_binop(this.values, other.values, fill_value)
            result = func(left, right)
            return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

In the corrected function, the division operations `rfloordiv` and `div` are handled separately to ensure correct usage of the `fill_value`. For other operations, the `fill_value` is applied normally during the binop operation.
