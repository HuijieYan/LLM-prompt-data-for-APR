The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `rfloordiv` function of the DataFrame class when using the `fill_value` parameter. The error is related to a division operation where a RuntimeWarning is encountered.

Looking at the source code of the `_combine_frame` function, it seems that the issue might be related to the calculation and handling of values when using different data types and operations. The `_arith_op` inner function performs some operations with left and right values, possibly causing type mismatches.

The bug seems to be triggered by an incorrect handling of division or arithmetic operations when dealing with different data types and the `fill_value` parameter.

A potential fix for this bug could entail ensuring that the `_arith_op` function correctly handles different types of operands and that the `fill_value` parameter is applied appropriately. Additionally, proper error and warning handling should be included to deal with potential issues such as division by zero.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Check for fill_value and handle it appropriately
        if fill_value is not None:
            left = left.fillna(fill_value)
            right = right.fillna(fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        # Handle potential issues such as division by zero
        with np.errstate(divide='ignore', invalid='ignore'):
            result = func(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

This corrected code includes proper handling for the `fill_value` parameter and uses `np.errstate` to handle RuntimeWarnings for division by zero. This should address the issues reported in the error messages and test cases.
