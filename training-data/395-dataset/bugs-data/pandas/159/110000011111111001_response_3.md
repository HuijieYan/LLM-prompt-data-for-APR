The error seems to be occurring when the `df` DataFrame is operated with the `other` DataFrame using the `.rfloordiv()` function with a `fill_value` parameter set to 1.

Looking at the code, it seems that the `_arith_op` function inside `_combine_frame` is not handling the division operation properly. Additionally, the handling of the `fill_value` parameter in the `_arith_op` function also needs to be verified.

The bug is occurring because the `_arith_op` function is not properly handling the division operation. Specifically, it seems that the use of the `fill_value` parameter in the division operation is leading to the unexpected behavior where 0 is not being correctly masked with Inf and instead is being treated as NaN.

To fix the bug, the `_arith_op` function needs to be modified to handle the division operation with the `fill_value` parameter in a way that properly masks 0 with Inf. Additionally, the implementation of the `fill_value` logic in the division operation also needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left_masked = ops.mask_div_zero(left, fill_value)
        right_masked = ops.mask_div_zero(right, fill_value)
        return func(left_masked, right_masked)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

Please note that the `_arith_op` function now includes the `ops.mask_div_zero` function to correctly handle the division operation with the `fill_value` parameter.

The `ops.mask_div_zero` function should be implemented in a way that properly masks 0 with Inf and not NaN as expected in the tests.
