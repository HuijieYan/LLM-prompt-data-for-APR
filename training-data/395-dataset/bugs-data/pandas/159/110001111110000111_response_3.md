The error message indicates that there are issues with the test functions related to "DataFrame.rfloordiv" and "DataFrame.div". These issues are likely due to the "_combine_frame" function in the "frame.py" file.

The potential error location is within the "_combine_frame" function, specifically in the calculation and assignment of the "result".

The bug occurs because the code is not handling the fill_value appropriately, leading to unexpected NaN and Inf values in the DataFrame calculations.

To fix the bug, the code should handle the fill_value parameter appropriately when performing calculations and creating the result DataFrame. Additionally, the code should ensure proper handling of NaN and Inf values during the division operation.

Below is the corrected code for the "_combine_frame" function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_159/pandas/core/frame.py

def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns
    
    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)
    
    result = _arith_op(this, other)
    
    if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
        result = pd.DataFrame(result)
    
    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

This corrected code performs the arithmetic operation with appropriate handling of fill_value and returns the result DataFrame using the _constructor method.

After applying the corrected code, the test functions related to "DataFrame.rfloordiv" and "DataFrame.div" should pass without any issues.
