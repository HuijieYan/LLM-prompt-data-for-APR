The errors in the provided code are likely occurring due to issues in the `_combine_frame` function within the `DataFrame` class. The errors are related to arithmetic operations and the handling of fill values. These issues are leading to unexpected warnings and incorrect results in the test cases.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `_combine_frame` function is not correctly handling the fill values and the arithmetic operations.

To fix the bug, the `_combine_frame` function can be updated to properly handle arithmetic operations and fill values. Additionally, the arithmetic operations should align with the expectations of the tests.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=True)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        result = ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, func)
    else:
        result = this.combine(other, func, fill_value=fill_value)

    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

In this corrected version of the `_combine_frame` function:
1. The `self.align` call properly handles the alignment of data frames for arithmetic operations.
2. The `ops.should_series_dispatch` condition correctly dispatches the operation to series if needed.
3. The final result is constructed using the `_constructor` method to ensure proper DataFrame construction.

After making these corrections, the test cases for the `_combine_frame` function should pass without any errors.
