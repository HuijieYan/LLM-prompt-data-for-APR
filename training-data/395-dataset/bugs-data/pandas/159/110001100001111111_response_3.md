The issue seems to be related to the division operation in the DataFrame when using the `fill_value` parameter. This is causing RuntimeWarnings to be raised.

The potential error location is the `_combine_frame` function, where the `func` parameter is being applied to the `this.values` and `other.values` arrays. It seems that the operation is not handling the `fill_value` parameter correctly, leading to the RuntimeWarnings.

The bug occurs because the division operation is encountering divide by zero and invalid value issues when using `fill_value`. This is likely due to an improper handling of the `fill_value` parameter in the division operation.

To fix the bug, the division operation should properly handle the `fill_value` parameter to avoid the RuntimeWarnings. This can be achieved by ensuring that the `fill_value` is appropriately handled in the division operation, especially when there are NaN or zero values.

The corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function with the fix is as follows:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        # handle fill_value for division operation
        if fill_value is not None:
            this = this.fillna(fill_value)
            other = other.fillna(fill_value)
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for the `fill_value` parameter and fill any NaN values in the data before the division operation is performed. This should prevent the RuntimeWarnings from occurring and ensure that the division operation with `fill_value` works as expected.
