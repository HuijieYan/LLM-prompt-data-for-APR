The bug in the provided function `_combine_frame` is likely causing the RuntimeWarning to occur during the use of the `div` operation with the `fill_value` parameter. The issue appears to be related to the alignment of the DataFrame columns and index.

The bug likely occurs during the alignment process in the `_combine_frame` function, where the `fill_value` is not handled correctly, leading to divide by zero and invalid value warnings.

To address the bug, the function `_combine_frame` needs to properly handle the `fill_value` and ensure that the division operation is performed correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    result = _arith_op(this, other)
    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

In this corrected version, the `func` is applied directly to `this` and `other` after proper handling of `fill_value` with `ops.fill_binop()`. The result is then used to create a new DataFrame with appropriate index and columns.

This corrected version should address the RuntimeWarning and handle the alignment for different columns and indices correctly.
