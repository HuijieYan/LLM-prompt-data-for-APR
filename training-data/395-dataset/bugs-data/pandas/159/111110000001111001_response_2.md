The buggy function `_combine_frame` is using the `align` method incorrectly. It seems to be expecting it to return a tuple of DataFrames, while in reality, it returns a single DataFrame. This leads to issues with the subsequent operations.

To fix this, the code should be modified to correctly handle the output of the `align` method, which provides a single DataFrame with aligned indices and columns. The subsequent operations should then be performed based on this aligned DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    aligned_frame = self.align(other, join='outer', copy=False)
    this, other = aligned_frame[0], aligned_frame[1]

    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Handle mixed-type case where _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # Iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

This corrected code aligns the DataFrame and then properly extracts the aligned DataFrame before proceeding with the subsequent operations based on the aligned data.
