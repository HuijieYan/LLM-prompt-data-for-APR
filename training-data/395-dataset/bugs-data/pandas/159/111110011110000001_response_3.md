The error is most likely occurring within the `_combine_frame` function, specifically in the part where the division operation involving `fill_value` is used to fill missing values in the dataframe.

Given that the test cases are related to division and flooring division of dataframes while specifying a `fill_value`, the issue might be in the `_combine_frame` function's interpretation or handling of the `fill_value` parameter. It's possible that the handling of `fill_value` during the arithmetic operations in the `_combine_frame` function is not working as intended, leading to incorrect results and assertion failures in the test cases.

To fix this bug, you could modify the `_combine_frame` function to ensure that the `fill_value` is correctly used during the arithmetic operations to handle missing values. It may also be necessary to double-check the division and flooring division implementations within the `_combine_frame` function to ensure they handle the `fill_value` appropriately.

Here is the corrected `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        return left.combine(other=right, func=func, fill_value=fill_value)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this, other)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

By using the `combine` method and providing the `fill_value` directly, we ensure that the correct behavior for handling missing values is employed during the arithmetic operations.
