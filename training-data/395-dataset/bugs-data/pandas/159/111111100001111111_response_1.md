The error occurs when the `a.rfloordiv(b, fill_value=1)` method is called, and it returns unexpected results. This is probably due to the alignment of different indices and columns.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_combine_frame` method.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of alignment for different columns and index values. This issue arises when performing arithmetic operations with different indices and columns, leading to inconsistencies and unexpected results.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure proper alignment of indices and columns when performing arithmetic operations between DataFrames. This can be achieved through the `align` method before performing the arithmetic operation.
2. Handle the specified `fill_value` properly to handle missing or NaN values based on the use case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    left, right = ops.fill_binop(this, other, fill_value)
    result = func(left, right)

    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

In this corrected code:
- The `align` method is used to ensure proper alignment of indices and columns before performing the arithmetic operation.
- The specified `fill_value` is properly handled using the `ops.fill_binop` function to handle missing or NaN values based on the use case.
- The `func` is applied to the aligned DataFrames to perform the arithmetic operation and obtain the result.

This correction ensures that the arithmetic operation is performed correctly while handling missing or NaN values based on the provided `fill_value`.
