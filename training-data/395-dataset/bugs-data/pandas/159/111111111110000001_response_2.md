The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `rfloordiv` method, which is used in the `test_fill_value_inf_masking` function. Additionally, there is an issue with the `div` method, as shown in the error message from the `test_dataframe_div_silenced` function. These methods are being called within the `DataFrame` class that contains the `_combine_frame` method. 

Upon analyzing the error messages and the test functions, it is evident that the bug is related to the arithmetic operations involving the `rfloordiv` and `div` methods. These methods are being used inside the `_combine_frame` method, and the issue is likely to be present in the arithmetic calculations within this method.

The bug likely occurred due to the mishandling of NaN and inf values during arithmetic operations in the `_combine_frame` method.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_combine_frame` method to handle NaN and inf values appropriately during arithmetic operations. The method should also ensure that the calculations are correctly aligned with the input data frames.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)

        # Handle inf values
        result[np.isinf(result)] = np.inf

        # Handle NaN values
        result[np.isnan(result)] = np.nan

        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the corrected `_combine_frame` method, after performing arithmetic operations, we handle any inf and NaN values present in the result appropriately. This should prevent the issues observed in the test functions.
