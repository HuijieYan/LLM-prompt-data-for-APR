The buggy function `_combine_frame` is performing arithmetic operations between DataFrames `this` and `other`. The bug is likely to be in the _arith_op function, which handles the element-wise operations. This is indicated by the unexpected behaviors and error messages in the provided test cases.

The bug is caused by a mismatch when replacing NaN values with a fill_value in the implementation of the function. This results in incorrect values being produced when the arithmetic operations are performed.

To fix the bug, the _arith_op function should properly handle the replacement of NaN values with the fill_value. Additionally, the implementation should ensure that the expected behavior is maintained for different scenarios.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Correctly handle NaN values with fill_value
        left = np.where(np.isnan(left), fill_value, left)
        right = np.where(np.isnan(right), fill_value, right)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

With these corrections, arithmetic operations between DataFrames should produce the expected results while properly handling NaN values and fill_values. This should resolve the issues identified in the provided test cases.
