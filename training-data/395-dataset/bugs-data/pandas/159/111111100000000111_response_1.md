The bug seems to be with the `_combine_frame` method of the DataFrame class. The bug is likely occurring because of an issue in the arithmetic operation performed in the `_combine_frame` method.

The error message "RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in true_divide" indicates that there is a divide by zero operation happening in the `DataFrame.div` operation. This is likely related to the arithmetic operations performed in the `_combine_frame` method.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_combine_frame` method to handle divide by zero errors by checking for zero values before performing the operation. We can replace the direct division with a safe division method that checks for zero values and handles them appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def safe_divide(left, right):
        # Safe division implementation to handle divide by zero
        result = left / right
        result[right == 0] = np.inf  # Replace divide by zero with infinity
        return result

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, safe_divide)
    else:
        result = safe_divide(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In this corrected code, we define a new function `safe_divide` that performs safe division, handling divide by zero by replacing the zero value in the denominator with infinity.

This approach should fix the bug and prevent the divide by zero error from occurring.
