The error message and test cases suggest that within the `_combine_frame` function, there is a problem with the way the division operation is being handled, especially with respect to the `fill_value`. The operation should handle this case differently, as the current implementation is causing unexpected behavior.

The error message indicates that the unexpected warning is caused by a divide by zero. This suggests that the `fill_value=0` parameter in the `pdf1.div(pdf2, fill_value=0)` statement is causing the issue. Additionally, there is another warning about invalid value encountered in true_divide.

To fix this, the division operation should be handled more robustly, especially when `fill_value` is provided. It needs to take into account edge cases such as divide by zero and invalid values.

Below is the corrected `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns
    
    def _arith_op(left, right):
        if fill_value is not None:
            # Handle division with fill_value
            left = left.replace(0, fill_value)
            right = right.replace(0, fill_value)
        
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # Iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In this corrected implementation, the division operation checks for the presence of `fill_value` and handles the case where division by zero could occur. It replaces zero values with the fill_value before performing the division. This approach ensures that unexpected warnings related to divide by zero are avoided.
