The issue seems to be related to the divide or floor divide operations between two dataframes, specifically when different columns and indices are involved.

1. The test case involves dividing two pandas DataFrames with different columns and indices using the `div` and `rfloordiv` operations, along with the `fill_value` parameter.
2. The error messages indicate warnings about division by zero and invalid value encountered during the division operation.
3. The bug could be located in the `_combine_frame` function where the division operation is being performed. It seems that the improper handling of different columns and indices during the alignment process might lead to this bug.
4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
    - Ensure proper alignment of dataframes before performing the division operation.
    - Handle cases where different fill values are required for specific columns or indices.
5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", axis=None, level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```
