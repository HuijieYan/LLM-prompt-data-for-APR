The potential error in the code is the function `_combine_frame`. The function is trying to align two DataFrames using the `align` method, but there is a mix-up with variable names and the alignment logic.

The bug occurs because the `funcs` module is not properly handling the alignment of the DataFrames `this` and `other` before performing the operation. This results in incorrect alignment or missing data, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `this` and `other` DataFrames are aligned properly before applying the `_arith_op` function. We also need to handle the case where the operation should be performed on a Series instead of the entire DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns
    
    def _arith_op(left, right, fill_value=fill_value):
        # Perform the arithmetic operation with fill value
        return func(left, right, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        result = ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this, other)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `this` and `other` DataFrames are properly aligned using the `align` method.
- The `_arith_op` function now takes `left` and `right` DataFrames as arguments instead of their values, and it also takes `fill_value` as an argument.
- The conditional check for `ops.should_series_dispatch` remains the same.
- The result is constructed using the `_constructor` method with the aligned index and columns.
