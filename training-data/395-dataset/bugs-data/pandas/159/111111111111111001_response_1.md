The test case `test_fill_value_inf_masking()` checks the behavior of the `rfloordiv()` method with a fill_value for division by zero. The error message indicates that the values generated by the function are not as expected, specifically for the 'A' column with values 'np.inf' and '1.0' being different.

The potential error location within the problematic function `_combine_frame()` is in its logic for handling the fill_value parameter. It seems that the `fill_value` is not properly handled in operations, resulting in incorrect values in the output.

The bug occurs because the `fill_value` parameter is not being used correctly in the `_combine_frame()` function. The operation with the fill_value is not being applied effectively to handle division by zero or special floating point numbers, resulting in unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the `_combine_frame()` function should correctly handle the fill_value when performing operations on the data and return expected results.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_combine_frame()`:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    if fill_value is not None:
        this = this.fillna(fill_value)
        other = other.fillna(fill_value)

    result = func(this, other)

    return self._constructor(
        result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `fill_value` is effectively used to fill NaN values in both `this` and `other` frames. Then, the operation is carried out with the fill_value taken into account. This ensures that division by zero or special floating point numbers are handled correctly, resulting in expected results.
