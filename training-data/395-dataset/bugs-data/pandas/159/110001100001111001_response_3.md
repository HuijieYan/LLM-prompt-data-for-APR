The issue with the provided function is that the variable `ops` is being used without being defined. This could be the reason for the buggy behavior, specifically in the logic where `if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func)`.

To fix the bug, the `ops` module needs to be imported and then used as part of the code. It's possible that the module has not been imported in the original code provided.

Here's the corrected code with the assumption that `ops` comes from the pandas library:

```python
import pandas as pd  # Importing the pandas library

# ... existing code ...

# Define the _combine_frame method with the fixed logic
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    if pd.core.ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):  # Using the `pd.core.ops` module
        # iterate over columns
        return pd.core.ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, lambda x, y: func(x, y))
    else:
        result = func(this.values, other.values)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

With the above changes, the `ops` module has been replaced with `pd.core.ops` to ensure that the function runs without any issues.
