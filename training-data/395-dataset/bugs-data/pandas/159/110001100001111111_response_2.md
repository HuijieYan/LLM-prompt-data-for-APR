The bug appears to be occurring in the `_combine_frame` method of the DataFrame class. It seems that the alignment between the two DataFrames `self` and `other` is not being correctly handled, leading to the incorrect results and runtime warnings when using arithmetic operations with `fill_value`.

The bug seems to occur due to the alignment process not taking into account the missing values (NaN) in the DataFrames and the mismatched indices and columns. This leads to incorrect calculations and mismatched results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the alignment process properly handles missing values and mismatches in indices and columns. Additionally, the arithmetic operations within the `_combine_frame` method need to handle the `fill_value` parameter appropriately for division and floor division operations.

Below is the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` method:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    # Handle missing values and mismatches in indices and columns
    this = this.fillna(fill_value)
    other = other.fillna(fill_value)

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # Perform arithmetic operation with fill_value
        result = func(left, right)
        return result

    if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        # Perform arithmetic operation with fill_value for the entire DataFrame
        result = _arith_op(this, other)
        return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

By adjusting the alignment process to handle missing values (NaN) and mismatches, and also properly handling the `fill_value` in the arithmetic operation, this should resolve the bug and prevent the occurrence of runtime warnings.
