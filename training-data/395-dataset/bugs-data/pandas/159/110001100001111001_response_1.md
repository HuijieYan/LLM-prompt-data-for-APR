The bug seems to be in the `_combine_frame` function.

Issue:
The `_combine_frame` function is unable to align the 'this' and 'other' DataFrames properly. Additionally, there are issues with the implementation within the `_combine_frame` function, which can result in incorrect behavior.

Potential solution:
1. Invalidate the cached property used for aligning the DataFrames and recalculate it.
2. Use the align function properly by assigning the result to 'this' and 'other' DataFrames.
3. Create a new DataFrame using the aligned results and pass it to the _arith_op function.

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    # align the two frames resulting from the current and other frames
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
  
    # Extract the index and columns from the aligned frame
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    # Implement a new version of _arith_op which directly uses func instead of depending on another method "ops"
    def _arith_op(left, right):
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    # Use simple array comparison to determine if the frames need to be dispatched to series or not
    if this.values.shape == other.values.shape:
        result = _arith_op(this.values, other.values)
    else:
        result = ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)

    # Correct the construction of the result into a new DataFrame with proper index and columns
    return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```
