The potential error in the provided function is that the `_arith_op` function is defined inside the `_combine_frame` function, but it is also redefined inside the `_combine_frame` function. This could lead to confusion and errors in the code.

To fix this, the `_arith_op` function should be removed from the `_combine_frame` function and defined as a separate method of the class `DataFrame`. This will ensure clarity and maintainability of the code.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class DataFrame(NDFrame):
    """
    Two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data
    structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations
    align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like
    container for Series objects. The primary pandas data structure.
    
    ... (other code) ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _arith_op(self, left, right, func, fill_value=None):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    # this is the corrected _combine_frame function
    def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
        this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
        new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns
    
        if ops.should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
            # iterate over columns
            return ops.dispatch_to_series(this, other, self._arith_op)
        else:
            result = self._arith_op(this.values, other.values, func)
            return self._constructor(result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False)
```

By defining the `_arith_op` function separately and calling it within the `_combine_frame` function, we ensure that the code is more organized and easier to understand.
