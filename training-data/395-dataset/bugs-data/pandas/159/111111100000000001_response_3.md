The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `ops` object, which is not defined or imported within the scope of the function.

The bug occurred because the `ops` object is being used without being defined or imported within the `_combine_frame` function. This is resulting in a NameError when trying to use the `ops` object.

To fix the bug, the `ops` object needs to be imported or defined within the scope of the `_combine_frame` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected code for the problematic function
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = left.fillna(fill_value), right.fillna(fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    if should_series_dispatch(this, other, func):
        # iterate over columns
        return dispatch_to_series(this, other, _arith_op)
    else:
        result = _arith_op(this, other)
        return self._constructor(
            result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
        )
```

In the corrected code, the `ops` object has been replaced with the functions `should_series_dispatch` and `dispatch_to_series`, which have been assumed to be part of the same module or library as the original `ops` object. The `fillna` method is also used directly on the `left` and `right` variables to fill NaN values.
