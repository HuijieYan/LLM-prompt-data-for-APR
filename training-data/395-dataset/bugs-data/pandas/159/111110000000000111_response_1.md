This is a bug in the `_combine_frame` function of the DataFrame class in the pandas library. The bug occurs because the `_arith_op` function, which is meant to handle arithmetic operations, is not being used correctly to handle mixed-type cases. This results in incorrect calculation and subsequent warnings about divide by zero or invalid values encountered. The bug is specifically present when aligning for different columns and index when performing floor division.

The potential error location is within the `_combine_frame` function, specifically in the section where it checks for mixed-type cases and iterates over columns to perform arithmetic operations.

To fix this bug, the `_combine_frame` function should correctly use the `_arith_op` function to handle mixed-type cases when iterating over columns. This will ensure that arithmetic operations are carried out in a way that avoids errors and warnings.

Below is the corrected code for the `_combine_frame` function:

```python
def _combine_frame(self, other, func, fill_value=None, level=None):
    this, other = self.align(other, join="outer", level=level, copy=False)
    new_index, new_columns = this.index, this.columns

    def _arith_op(left, right):
        # for the mixed_type case where we iterate over columns,
        # _arith_op(left, right) is equivalent to
        # left._binop(right, func, fill_value=fill_value)
        left, right = ops.fill_binop(left, right, fill_value)
        return func(left, right)

    result = this.apply(lambda col: _arith_op(col, other[col.name]), axis=0)

    return self._constructor(
        result, index=new_index, columns=new_columns, copy=False
    )
```
