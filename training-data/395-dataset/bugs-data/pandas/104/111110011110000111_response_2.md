Issue Analysis:
The error is raised due to an assertion error in the `quantile` method of the `GroupBy` class.
- The data used for the test case is the `DataFrame` with a shape of (2, 3) and (100, 10).
- The test parameters used for the `groupby` and `q` were [0], [0, 1] and [0.5, 0.6] respectively.

Bug Location:
The bug occurs in the part of the `quantile` method where it tries to reorder levels and assert the length of indices and results. This part seems to be malfunctioning, causing the assertion error.

Reasons for the Bug:
The issue seems to stem from the incorrect ordering of levels and the assertion check on the length of results and indices. Additionally, the test cases with larger dataframes might be causing the problem due to the reordering logic.

Potential Fixes:
1. Remove or modify the logic for reordering levels.
2. Check and fix the assertion condition for the length of results and indices.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class GroupBy(_GroupBy):
    # ...omitted code...

    # this is the corrected function
    def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
        # ...omitted code...

        if is_scalar(q):
            return self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=pre_processor,
                post_processing=post_processor,
                q=q,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
        else:
            results = [
                self._get_cythonized_result(
                    "group_quantile",
                    aggregate=True,
                    needs_values=True,
                    needs_mask=True,
                    cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                    pre_processing=pre_processor,
                    post_processing=post_processor,
                    q=qi,
                    interpolation=interpolation,
                )
                for qi in q
            ]
            result = concat(results, axis=0, keys=q)
            result = result.reindex(q, level=-1)
            return result
```

This corrected function removes the logic for reordering levels and modifies the reindexing logic to avoid the assertion error. This should resolve the issue with the `quantile` method.
