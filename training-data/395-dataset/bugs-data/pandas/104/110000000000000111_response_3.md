The error seems to be occurring in the "groupby.quantile()" function when it is called with an array-like parameter. The specific error is an AssertionError, and the error message indicates that there is an issue with the length of `indices` and `result`.

The issue seems to be in the logic for handling array-like input (e.g., quantile([0.5,0.99])) within the 'quantile' method of the groupby object. The error occurs because the calculation and concatenation of `arrays` within the for-loop is not handling the larger dataframe inputs correctly.

The bug is likely to have occurred due to incorrect handling of array-like inputs, resulting in an AssertionError when the length of `indices` does not match the length of `result`. This is likely due to an incorrect iteration or concatenation logic.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling array-like inputs should be revised to handle larger dataframes correctly. The concatenation of `arrays` within the for-loop should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly handles the larger dataframes.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, interpolation: str = "linear"):
    from pandas import concat

    # Define the custom pre-processor and post-processor functions
    def pre_processor(vals: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[Type]]:
        if is_object_dtype(vals):
            raise TypeError("'quantile' cannot be performed against 'object' dtypes!")

        inference = None
        if is_integer_dtype(vals):
            inference = np.int64
        elif is_datetime64_dtype(vals):
            inference = "datetime64[ns]"
            vals = vals.astype(np.float)

        return vals, inference

    def post_processor(vals: np.ndarray, inference: Optional[Type]) -> np.ndarray:
        if inference and not (is_integer_dtype(inference) and interpolation in {"linear", "midpoint"}):
            vals = vals.astype(inference)

        return vals

    # Check if q is scalar or an array-like input
    if is_scalar(q):
        result = self._get_cythonized_result(
            "group_quantile",
            aggregate=True,
            needs_values=True,
            needs_mask=True,
            cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
            pre_processing=pre_processor,
            post_processing=post_processor,
            q=q,
            interpolation=interpolation,
        )
    else:
        results = []
        for qi in q:
            result = self._get_cythonized_result(
                "group_quantile",
                aggregate=True,
                needs_values=True,
                needs_mask=True,
                cython_dtype=np.dtype(np.float64),
                pre_processing=pre_processor,
                post_processing=post_processor,
                q=qi,
                interpolation=interpolation,
            )
            results.append(result)
        result = concat(results, axis=0, keys=q)
        result = result.reorder_levels([1, 0])

    return result
```
