The buggy function is `_get_nearest_indexer`. It tries to find the nearest index labels, but it has an issue in determining the sign of the distances and choosing the indices based on that. The function compares the left_distances and right_distances using the `operator.lt` function, but it should actually use the `<` operator directly.

To fix the bug, the comparison operation needs to be changed from `op(left_distances, right_distances)` to `left_distances < right_distances`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    indexer = np.where(left_distances < right_distances | (right_indexer == -1),
                       left_indexer,
                       right_indexer)
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
