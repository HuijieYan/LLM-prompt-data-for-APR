The potential error in the _get_nearest_indexer function is the use of "self.is_monotonic_increasing" without calling it as a method. It should be "self.is_monotonic_increasing()" to call the method and get the boolean result.

The bug is occurring because "self.is_monotonic_increasing" is treated as a method or property, but it is actually a method that needs to be called to get the boolean result. This causes the comparison to fail and may result in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the code should call the "is_monotonic_increasing" method by adding parentheses after it.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_nearest_indexer function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
