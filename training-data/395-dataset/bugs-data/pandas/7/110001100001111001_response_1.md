The given buggy function is supposed to return the indexer for the nearest index labels. It tries to calculate the distances between the target index and the existing values in the index and then tries to determine the nearest indexers based on these distances.

Looking at the code, it seems the bug arises from the use of `self.is_monotonic_increasing` where `self.is_monotonic_increasing` is a method. It seems that the intention was to call the method `self.is_monotonic_increasing()` to get the boolean value, but the function checks for `self.is_monotonic_increasing` as a property, which does not exist and is hence buggy. 

To fix this, the function `_get_nearest_indexer` should call `self.is_monotonic_increasing()` as a method to get the boolean value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
