The given function is designed to get the indexer for the nearest index labels. It takes the target index, a limit, and a tolerance as input parameters. The function finds the nearest index labels by calculating the distances from the target index and then applies a comparison operator to choose the appropriate indexer.

The bug in the function is that it doesn't handle the input parameters properly, and the comparison operation might not work as intended due to potential inconsistencies.

To fix the bug, the function should handle different input parameter types in a more robust manner. It should also ensure that the comparison operation is well-defined for the input types.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import operator

def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = np.abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = np.abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    if isinstance(left_distances[0], str) or isinstance(left_distances[0], tuple):
        raise ValueError("Values that can be subtracted from each other are required")

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the corrected function:
- The input types are handled using the `isinstance` function to ensure the function works with valid input types.
- The `np.abs` function is used to calculate absolute differences between the values, ensuring the operation works as intended.
- A `ValueError` is raised if the input types are not valid for subtraction.
- The comparison operation is performed after ensuring the input types are valid and compatible.
